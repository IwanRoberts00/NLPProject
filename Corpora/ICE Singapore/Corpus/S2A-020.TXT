<I>

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-020#1:1:A>
But they shouldn't get nervous like they did against Kedah when
they had a very nervous opening few minutes

<ICE-SIN:S2A-020#2:1:A>
And coming running forward straight away is Ahmad Eusoff

<ICE-SIN:S2A-020#3:1:A>
He sends the ball outside to uh to Zul Hamizan

<ICE-SIN:S2A-020#4:1:A>
Good cross inside by Zul Hamizan ball control and a chance right to
one nil for Pahang

<ICE-SIN:S2A-020#5:1:A>
Hand ball the referee says no

<ICE-SIN:S2A-020#6:1:A>
Singapore complain it's hand ball but the referee says it's a goal
in their very first minute from Michael Paterson the Australian import and uh
they came here for an earlier now they're gonna defend with all their might
for the rest of the match

<ICE-SIN:S2A-020#7:1:A>
Well taken goal as well

<ICE-SIN:S2A-020#8:1:A>
Pahang one Singapore nil and only the very first minute of play

<ICE-SIN:S2A-020#9:1:A>
Saswa losing the ball

<ICE-SIN:S2A-020#10:1:A>
Zul Hamid that's Dollar Salee

<ICE-SIN:S2A-020#11:1:A>
Well controlled out to Zul Hamizan

<ICE-SIN:S2A-020#12:1:A>
Zul Hamizan once again crossing the ball this time

<ICE-SIN:S2A-020#13:1:A>
Zanial Abidin was offside

<ICE-SIN:S2A-020#14:1:A>
He scored against Singapore in Kuantan aiming to get another goal
this evening

<ICE-SIN:S2A-020#15:1:A>
Nazri Nasir who shadowed him all the way if Pahang will do so again
but not a very good start by Singapore

<ICE-SIN:S2A-020#16:1:A>
They came forward looking for the early goal when Abbas just pumped
the ball right upfront into the Pahang defence

<ICE-SIN:S2A-020#17:1:A>
Instead it is Pahang who got the early much to the disgust of the
National coach P N Sivaji

<ICE-SIN:S2A-020#18:1:A>
Ahmad Ibrahim trying to unsettle the defenders

<ICE-SIN:S2A-020#19:1:A>
Abbas Said came charging in

<ICE-SIN:S2A-020#20:1:A>
That was definitely a free kick for Pahang

<ICE-SIN:S2A-020#21:1:A>
Alison down once again

<ICE-SIN:S2A-020#22:1:A>
Aziza Kamaludin Azarudin clears it upfront

<ICE-SIN:S2A-020#23:1:A>
Easy for Jang Jung

<ICE-SIN:S2A-020#24:1:A>
The fans trying to rally the lions on back into the game

<ICE-SIN:S2A-020#25:1:A>
They came back at Kuantan can they do so at the National Stadium

<ICE-SIN:S2A-020#26:1:A>
Sundram comes in with an all important tackle

<ICE-SIN:S2A-020#27:1:A>
Fandi loses the ball in mid-field though Michael Paterson picks it
up

<ICE-SIN:S2A-020#28:1:A>
Outside lack of support assign each other

<ICE-SIN:S2A-020#29:1:A>
Good work with uh Rohamizan

<ICE-SIN:S2A-020#30:1:A>
This is great football by Pahang finally cut out by a figure of
Saswadimata Dazuki

<ICE-SIN:S2A-020#31:1:A>
Rafi Abbas back to Rafi Ali

<ICE-SIN:S2A-020#32:1:A>
Can Rafi take it on for Singapore now

<ICE-SIN:S2A-020#33:1:A>
He just stopped the ball had actually gone out before Alan Davidson
came in with the sliding tackle to prevent Rafi Ali from moving forward

<ICE-SIN:S2A-020#34:1:A>
Jang Jung will have to chase with all his might against uh a guy
who scored the F A uh Malaysia Cup Final goal last season for Pahang

<ICE-SIN:S2A-020#35:1:A>
Johamie Zann da Paria he created a goal for Michael Paterson and I
see Pahang <unclear> word </unclear> must be very happy with the start

<ICE-SIN:S2A-020#36:1:A>
He came in with a defensive line up preferring to drop his
top-scorer Jose and right now that defensive line up will certainly be very
useful and and important to this side

<ICE-SIN:S2A-020#37:1:A>
Ahmad Ibrahim took <unclear> word </unclear> on to that Abbas Said
pass Kadir Rafi Nazri clearing his clearance that time

<ICE-SIN:S2A-020#38:1:A>
Kadir Yahya trying to chase for this

<ICE-SIN:S2A-020#39:1:A>
Abdullah Malek left to support and finally gets the ball

<ICE-SIN:S2A-020#40:1:A>
Yes he clears it first time thought there is no support

<ICE-SIN:S2A-020#41:1:A>
Danguh here they cannot play it inside their defenders third with
that form

<ICE-SIN:S2A-020#42:1:A>
You are right Jamie they're taking uh quite sometime to settle down

<ICE-SIN:S2A-020#43:1:A>
They haven't really found their rhythm yet Saswadimata Dazuki
trying to hand <unclear> word </unclear> mid-field uses Nazri Nasir upfront
only Abbas Said doing the running

<ICE-SIN:S2A-020#44:1:A>
Ahmad Ibrahim is static at the moment

<ICE-SIN:S2A-020#45:1:A>
Abbas couldn't do anything about that

<ICE-SIN:S2A-020#46:1:A>
Malek knows the size but still run the ball

<ICE-SIN:S2A-020#47:1:A>
Sundram will have to get Sundram into the thick of action

<ICE-SIN:S2A-020#48:1:A>
Kadir Yahya slips off the wrong moment

<ICE-SIN:S2A-020#49:1:A>
Rafi Ali will pick it up in field

<ICE-SIN:S2A-020#50:1:A>
He's got Sundram asking for help

<ICE-SIN:S2A-020#51:1:A>
Poor pass though by Rafi Ali

<ICE-SIN:S2A-020#52:1:A>
Jang Jung comes in with a fantastic tackle there

<ICE-SIN:S2A-020#53:1:A>
And the Singapore defender Rafi paced once again there by Michael
Paterson

<ICE-SIN:S2A-020#54:1:A>
Abbas Said great tackle by Alan Davidson Fandi

<ICE-SIN:S2A-020#55:1:A>
It's a little bit messy for Singapore in mid-field

<ICE-SIN:S2A-020#56:1:A>
Fandi Ahmad though he loses his Geylang team-mate Ahmad Ibrahim
will try to get over him he's got a few players waiting for that <unclear>
word </unclear> cross

<ICE-SIN:S2A-020#57:1:A>
It goes to a Pahang player though

<ICE-SIN:S2A-020#58:1:A>
Rafi Ali picks it up in mid-field now for Singapore plays it wide
uses Kadir Yahya

<ICE-SIN:S2A-020#59:1:A>
Still the players waiting at the penalty box across

<ICE-SIN:S2A-020#60:1:A>
Alan Davidson comes to cover Edmund seized a corner

<ICE-SIN:S2A-020#61:1:A>
With the first corner of the match going to Singapore

<ICE-SIN:S2A-020#62:1:A>
Six minutes of play gone by Malek Awab <unclear> word </unclear>
there and it's totally unimpressive

<ICE-SIN:S2A-020#63:1:A>
From a score line still stays at one nil Pahang lead they've got
all their eleven players back at their own half defending their Singapore
goal and Singapore will win a free kick for that close by <unclear> word
</unclear> on V Sundram Moorthy for Singapore also had the first free kick of
the match

<ICE-SIN:S2A-020#64:1:A>
Kadir got some space now

<ICE-SIN:S2A-020#65:1:A>
Can he pick his spot

<ICE-SIN:S2A-020#66:1:A>
He tries it and just missing by an inch

<ICE-SIN:S2A-020#67:1:A>
Abbas Said I think it was just missing it a little bit and Kadir
Yahya's drill inside the penalty box was almost very very effective

<ICE-SIN:S2A-020#68:1:A>
Good work then by Saswadimata Dazuki winning the ball over to
Dollar Saleh

<ICE-SIN:S2A-020#69:1:A>
Sundram to Zanial then Ahmad Ibrahim

<ICE-SIN:S2A-020#70:1:A>
That was definitely a foul by Osami Jalial referee coming up to
warn him

<ICE-SIN:S2A-020#71:1:A>
Actually uh pretended that he didn't hear the whistle go at all

<ICE-SIN:S2A-020#72:1:A>
Saleh <unclear> word </unclear> that just and now Osami Malaysian
International giving away yet another free kick for Singapore

<ICE-SIN:S2A-020#73:1:A>
Sundram once again drills it low

<ICE-SIN:S2A-020#74:1:A>
Ahmad Ibrahim tries to flick it on

<ICE-SIN:S2A-020#75:1:A>
No one there though

<ICE-SIN:S2A-020#76:1:A>
Rafi Ali has a chance to shoot <unclear> word </unclear>

<ICE-SIN:S2A-020#77:1:A>
The action still goes on though inside the Pahang half

<ICE-SIN:S2A-020#78:1:A>
Malek Awab as he goals it across and the goalkeeper gathered it
very easily but a fantastic cross though by Malek Awab

<ICE-SIN:S2A-020#79:1:A>
Ahmad Eusoff former team-mate Fandi Ahmad in close proximity

<ICE-SIN:S2A-020#80:1:A>
Jang Jung steps in with a clearance but nobody upfront though to
lend support

<ICE-SIN:S2A-020#81:1:A>
Alan Davidson goes <unclear> word </unclear> to the best foreign
player

<ICE-SIN:S2A-020#82:1:A>
Won it hands down last season guiding Pahang to the double Malaysia
Cup in the Semi-pro Division One League title

<ICE-SIN:S2A-020#83:1:A>
Sundram stepping the pace up for Singapore just now

<ICE-SIN:S2A-020#84:1:A>
His first touch just led down V Sundram Moorthy

<ICE-SIN:S2A-020#85:1:A>
To be fair to him it wasn't very easy to control the ball not when
the defender kept breathing down your neck

<ICE-SIN:S2A-020#86:1:A>
Tapping his ankle but he made the move he built it up

<ICE-SIN:S2A-020#87:1:A>
He stepped the pace up a little bit

<ICE-SIN:S2A-020#88:1:A>
Fandi Ahmad continues to run and almost ended up as a goal for
Singapore

<ICE-SIN:S2A-020#89:1:A>
Asa Rudin Zanial winning that header over Nazri Nasir

<ICE-SIN:S2A-020#90:1:A>
Nazri up to Fandi

<ICE-SIN:S2A-020#91:1:A>
Wonderful touch by Fandi Ahmad

<ICE-SIN:S2A-020#92:1:A>
Alan Davidson though twills it easily and as easily as <unclear>
word </unclear> I must say

<ICE-SIN:S2A-020#93:1:A>
He spotted his player just one touch of the head Zanial trying to
set up Rohami Zann

<ICE-SIN:S2A-020#94:1:A>
Danger's not over yet

<ICE-SIN:S2A-020#95:1:A>
Ahmad Eusoff collects and passes

<ICE-SIN:S2A-020#96:1:A>
Ahmad Eusoff now once again

<ICE-SIN:S2A-020#97:1:A>
Few players waiting in the box

<ICE-SIN:S2A-020#98:1:A>
One of them is Dollah Saleh

<ICE-SIN:S2A-020#99:1:A>
Zanial trying one to Dollah

<ICE-SIN:S2A-020#100:1:A>
Dollah gets free from Nazri for a short <unclear> word </unclear>

<ICE-SIN:S2A-020#101:1:A>
He flicks it up and Abdul Malek had to scratch

<ICE-SIN:S2A-020#102:1:A>
P N Sivaji came storming out of his bench when he saw that and
this is why he was so pissed off

<ICE-SIN:S2A-020#103:1:A>
Ahmad Ibrahim to Malek

<ICE-SIN:S2A-020#104:1:A>
Header down by Alan Davidson again Malek though wins it over
Zanial Abidin releases Abbas Said who switches play nicely over to the right

<ICE-SIN:S2A-020#105:1:A>
Sundram Moorthy has the ball

<ICE-SIN:S2A-020#106:1:A>
Sundram has got a defender in front of him decides to take it on

<ICE-SIN:S2A-020#107:1:A>
Checks but Kadir Yahya in support loses Kadir cross come in

<ICE-SIN:S2A-020#108:1:A>
Not a very good one though

<ICE-SIN:S2A-020#109:1:A>
Fandi brings it down very well <unclear> word </unclear> Malek
easy for the goalkeeper

<ICE-SIN:S2A-020#110:1:A>
We've played thirteen minutes on the match

<ICE-SIN:S2A-020#111:1:A>
Pahang lead Singapore by one goal to nil

<ICE-SIN:S2A-020#112:1:A>
The goal scored in the very first minute of play by Michael
Paterson and Ahmad Eusoff the <unclear> word </unclear> to this Pahang side
being warned by the referee over that tough of hard challenge from behind on
Fandi Ahmad

<ICE-SIN:S2A-020#113:1:A>
Jang Jung Sundram nice touch by V Sundram Moorthy

<ICE-SIN:S2A-020#114:1:A>
Receives it back from Kadir plays a one two with Fandi almost
worked out

<ICE-SIN:S2A-020#115:1:A>
Kadir here has a chance to <unclear> word </unclear> ball back

<ICE-SIN:S2A-020#116:1:A>
Comes out Sundram wins a header very well

<ICE-SIN:S2A-020#117:1:A>
Fandi Ahmad can he do another <unclear> word </unclear> for Pahang

<ICE-SIN:S2A-020#118:1:A>
He did it against uh at Kuantan

<ICE-SIN:S2A-020#119:1:A>
He almost did it again

<ICE-SIN:S2A-020#120:1:A>
Nazri Nasir loses <unclear> word </unclear> responsibility against
Zanial Abidin

<ICE-SIN:S2A-020#121:1:A>
Jang Jung though was there

<ICE-SIN:S2A-020#122:1:A>
Good play by Jang Jung well-covered

<ICE-SIN:S2A-020#123:1:A>
Ahmad Ibrahim opening out

<ICE-SIN:S2A-020#124:1:A>
Loses the ball momentarily

<ICE-SIN:S2A-020#125:1:A>
Fandi well picks it up

<ICE-SIN:S2A-020#126:1:A>
Kadir Yahya with a lot of room right now on the right flank
running down

<ICE-SIN:S2A-020#127:1:A>
All the players go inside the penalty box waiting for it and look
how Alan Davidson read that one anticipated it so very well just stepped in
took control and now he has the ball

<ICE-SIN:S2A-020#128:1:A>
Releases Zanial Abidin once again

<ICE-SIN:S2A-020#129:1:A>
Squeeze in from uh Nazri but shows Rafi too much of the ball

<ICE-SIN:S2A-020#130:1:A>
This Fandi Ahmad Saswa

<ICE-SIN:S2A-020#131:1:A>
The afternoon downpour not helping him at all regaining his
balance

<ICE-SIN:S2A-020#132:1:A>
Kadir Sundram Malek has got some space now Malek Kawab

<ICE-SIN:S2A-020#133:1:A>
The pass there to Abbas Said

<ICE-SIN:S2A-020#134:1:A>
It's a little too far

<ICE-SIN:S2A-020#135:1:A>
Ah lovely play by Alan Davidson once again

<ICE-SIN:S2A-020#136:1:A>
Abbas Said he's beaten by his Australian compatriot

<ICE-SIN:S2A-020#137:1:A>
One nil still the score and that Davidson move certainly sums up
the match so far and he has certainly been the key figure

<ICE-SIN:S2A-020#138:1:A>
Nasir Rudin pumps it up upfront

<ICE-SIN:S2A-020#139:1:A>
It's for Dollah Saleh

<ICE-SIN:S2A-020#140:1:A>
Beaten to it by Saswadimata Dazuki Jang Jung Sundram

<ICE-SIN:S2A-020#141:1:A>
It's time to turn

<ICE-SIN:S2A-020#142:1:A>
Looks up for support finds it in the figure of Fandi Ahmad

<ICE-SIN:S2A-020#143:1:A>
Fandi couldn't get anywhere though

<ICE-SIN:S2A-020#144:1:A>
Trying to actually go round the Pahang middle instead of uh using
the flanks which they have done so effectively all season round

<ICE-SIN:S2A-020#145:1:A>
Oh great play by V Sundram Moorthy <unclear> word </unclear>
himself there Sundram finds some space

<ICE-SIN:S2A-020#146:1:A>
Can he find the angle for the shot

<ICE-SIN:S2A-020#147:1:A>
Ahmad Ibrahim would have made a great return if he had connected
cleanly

<ICE-SIN:S2A-020#148:1:A>
The crowd had sense that V Sundram Moorthy actually took a shot
instead of playing inside for Abbas Said

<ICE-SIN:S2A-020#149:1:A>
What do you think Jamie

<ICE-SIN:S2A-020#150:1:A>
At the moment Ahmad Ibrahim has gone down to take uh Sundram
Moorthy's right mid-fielder's role and uh Sundram has gone up to corner

<ICE-SIN:S2A-020#151:1:A>
Abbas Said upfront so even the pattern of play in the Singapore
side at the is missing

<ICE-SIN:S2A-020#152:1:A>
Definitely a foul

<ICE-SIN:S2A-020#153:1:A>
Not spotted by the referee and I think he's gonna give the yellow
card to uh Asimi Dalliel Mo

<ICE-SIN:S2A-020#154:1:A>
Well he reached for his pocket and thought twice about it

<ICE-SIN:S2A-020#155:1:A>
Isn't as bad as his earlier tackle on V Sundram Moorthy and as we
speak Abbas Said in fact has taken over Sundram's place on right mid-field
and Sundram has partner Ahmad Ibrahim upfront

<ICE-SIN:S2A-020#156:1:A>
Fandi a free kick inside to V Sundram Moorthy who escaped from his
mark momentarily but a good tackle then

<ICE-SIN:S2A-020#157:1:A>
Well recovered Osami Jaliel

<ICE-SIN:S2A-020#158:1:A>
Sundram though forces the corner the second of the match for
Singapore

<ICE-SIN:S2A-020#159:1:A>
The fever though building at the National Stadium

<ICE-SIN:S2A-020#160:1:A>
They took quite a while to come back against Pahang in Kuantan

<ICE-SIN:S2A-020#161:1:A>
Can they do so a little quicker in this match

<ICE-SIN:S2A-020#162:1:A>
Malek decides to keep the ball in playing across though easy for
Alan Davidson

<ICE-SIN:S2A-020#163:1:A>
Fandi Ahmad builds it over again

<ICE-SIN:S2A-020#164:1:A>
Well saved by the defender

<ICE-SIN:S2A-020#165:1:A>
Kadir Yahya will have to use Saswadimata Dazuki

<ICE-SIN:S2A-020#166:1:A>
The Pahang players push up very quickly but Rafi Ali though

<ICE-SIN:S2A-020#167:1:A>
Oh the ball had only gone out

<ICE-SIN:S2A-020#168:1:A>
Not a very good first touch by Rafi

<ICE-SIN:S2A-020#169:1:A>
As you'll expect for a team down by a goal to nil

<ICE-SIN:S2A-020#170:1:A>
Jang Jung misses the header

<ICE-SIN:S2A-020#171:1:A>
Danguh now Nazri Nasir has got imposing figure of Zanial Abidin
who screened it very well

<ICE-SIN:S2A-020#172:1:A>
Malek there did the sensible thing not blasting it against uh
Azizul Kamaludin the player who has replaced Jose Ariateh and he throws it
all the way back to the other Malek goalkeeper Abdul Malek <X>

<ICE-SIN:S2A-020#X173:1:A>
Well he certainly must be feeling very unsettled Abdul Malek
before he could even have a catch a glimpse of the ball he had to pick it out
from the back of his net Fandi down to Malek again Sundram Moorthy is racing
for that Alan Davidson is there Hits it out only as far as uh Ahmad Ibrahim
Does well to turn pass the player Saswadimata picks up the loose ball loses
Jang Jung Rafee good work by Rafee Ali Up by Kadir Yayha though Abbas Said
and Kadir Yahya both with different roles then Zanial oh lovely click on
Ahmad Eusoff letching onto this one But look who's there again Jang Jung
Kamaludin This is Azarudin passing it He knows Zanial is there so jump a part
of his all those headers Abbas Said trying to defend Kamal Zahamizan Good
tackle by Rafee Ali And then by Ahmad Ibrahim Alan Davidson good pass by
Davidson and finally Singapore <unclear> word </unclear> Rafee Ali giving it
back to Jang Jung Malek has got some space now in mid-field Decides to use V
Sundram Moorthy We're seeing more and more of this number eighteen now from
Singapore Kadir Yahya Up high the cross was low and not very good and swung
outside Rafee to Jang Jung Good play by Rafee Ali Jang Jung holds that up for
a little for the players to come back Keep themselves on an onside position
Fandi trying to goal ball by himself Good work there by Fandi Ahmad and good
save by Malek Mohammud Confidence restored Fandi Ahmad and after the goal
scored against Pahang That was his first goal in five hundred and thirty-two
minutes of football It's one record which uh Fandi Ahmad he holds a lot of
record </X> </I>
