<I>

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-026#1:1:A>
Sex yes s e x

<ICE-SIN:S1B-026#2:1:A>
Some people say there's too much sex on the Singapore stage too much
of a bad thing

<ICE-SIN:S1B-026#3:1:A>
Other say you ain't seen nothing yet

<ICE-SIN:S1B-026#4:1:A>
There's not enough of the good thing but there are a few critics who
go so far to say that the over-indulgence is tainting Singapore theatre

<ICE-SIN:S1B-026#5:1:A>
Before we hear our studio guest let's watch a video clip of recent
productions so be comfortable and breathe normally

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-026#6:1:A>
I got to check my pulse rate how's yours

<ICE-SIN:S1B-026#7:1:A>
Well was that interesting disgusting or you may be thinking what's
the big deal

<ICE-SIN:S1B-026#8:1:A>
Maybe I'll start with you Keng Sen

<ICE-SIN:S1B-026#9:1:A>
What's the big deal

<ICE-SIN:S1B-026#10:1:A>
Is there really too much sex on Singapore stage

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-026#11:1:B>
Well I think that uh I mean I've been looking at the at the
clips right and two of the plays were directed by myself

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-026#12:1:A>
That's why that's why we brought you here

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-026#13:1:B>
Yah and uhm I suppose I'm more incline to what's the big deal
because I feel that uh at this moment Singaporean theatre is still exploring
you know so it's really of a a virgin I mean we are we are uhm we've been
doing Singlish in Singaporean theatre for the last uh five six years in a
very intense way uhm and if we start dictating right now what to write to the
playwright I think that we are self-censoring to

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-026#14:1:A>
Your <unclear> word </unclear> but the question is why
exploring just the sexual themes there are so many other things

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-026#15:1:B>
I think that then it must be important enough to the
playwrights you see because maybe sexuality is an important concern uh for
many young people because they they see that uh as a a as an identity uh as a
a a a a a a way in which they can talk about other themes for instance

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-026#16:1:A>
Oh let's check with the playwright

<ICE-SIN:S1B-026#17:1:A>
Is that true

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-026#18:1:C>
Well I was first of all going to say that I dispute the fact
that there's a over-indulgence in

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-026#19:1:A>
Of course you're a lawyer right

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-026#20:1:C>
And I feel I can martial some facts to to back it up

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-026#21:1:A>
Okay let's have some facts

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-026#22:1:C>
I think that if you really look at the number of plays that
had been put up over the past three or four years uhm in the course of which
goes you know four or five clips were were chosen and uh presented to you in
you know close proximity wow sex sex sex

<ICE-SIN:S1B-026#23:1:C>
I think in between all of these plays you'll find that there were
many other plays perhaps uhm not evoking so much media interest uh which
dealt with quite apart from sex

<ICE-SIN:S1B-026#24:1:C>
The the the point we

<$D> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-026#25:1:D>
need to address is not not merely a question of uhm whether we
should be self-censoring whether in fact when people take issue with
playwrights who write controversial plays then in fact this is a call for
more conservatives uh theatre

<ICE-SIN:S1B-026#26:1:D>
I don't think that is that is the demand of a great many people

<ICE-SIN:S1B-026#27:1:D>
I think a nude body on stage does does not in itself constitute uhm
a sexist gesture

<ICE-SIN:S1B-026#28:1:D>
I think what what needs to be analysed is is really the question of
what use it's made of the body uhm some ways that is where the problem lies
you see

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-026#29:1:A>
Okay

<$D> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-026#30:1:D>
How do we make use of sexual expression

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-026#31:1:B>
I feel that right now most writers are really with because at
one stage Singaporean writing was not honest and we wanted Singaporean
writing to be honest so we told the playwright

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-026#32:1:A>
Is the honesty is the sex uh equate with honesty

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-026#33:1:C>
It's one part of honesty

<ICE-SIN:S1B-026#34:1:C>
I think you know

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-026#35:1:A>
Okay you agree with that Sanjay

<$D> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-026#36:1:D>
Well I think I think to a very large extent that's true
although my concern here is also to want to push push the argument a little
further

<ICE-SIN:S1B-026#37:1:D>
I think there's a complex uhm situation here because on the one
hand you have people who are in fact dealing with questions that are very
close to their hearts and I think this is valid this is legitimate this is
very important in fact

<ICE-SIN:S1B-026#38:1:D>
But on the other hand I think one of the things that uhm we need to
begin to address is also the question of how the question of sex or more
importantly sexuality begins to actually move into into into into larger
questions largely social questions as well and in in in in some ways for me
that is where the challenge of Singapore theatre lies

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-026#39:1:A>
Sorry Sanjay I have to interrupt you here for a short break we
get back to you

<ICE-SIN:S1B-026#40:1:A>
Stay tune we'll be back

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-026#41:1:A>
Welcome back

<ICE-SIN:S1B-026#42:1:A>
Thank you for staying tune in

<ICE-SIN:S1B-026#43:1:A>
Now let get back to Sanjay you were saying

<$D> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-026#44:1:D>
Uhm I'm thinking also of the the problem in in recent place
where the question of censorship becomes a very central problem

<ICE-SIN:S1B-026#45:1:D>
Uhm and it seems to me uhm that you know you have on the one hand a
liberal sort of uhm avant-garde uhm artiste uhm our artistic avant-garde
against the conservative establishment and you know what happens in this
debate is uh

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-026#46:1:A>
You feel the divide

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-026#47:1:B>
Uhm I think definitely

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-026#48:1:A>
Are you avant-garde

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-026#49:1:B>
There's divide there's divide

<ICE-SIN:S1B-026#50:1:B>
I don't think there is so much avant-garde but I think that the
problem right now is that Singaporean society is so reactionary you see

<ICE-SIN:S1B-026#51:1:B>
I feel I feel that artiste just need to have some leeway to explore
to explore issues but as soon as issues are explored there is a big hue and
cry and suddenly it explodes in our faces into something which which very
soon I think laws and regulations will be created to blunt us

<$D> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-026#52:1:D>
This this is my point as well you see

<ICE-SIN:S1B-026#53:1:D>
My point is also that if or if if there is if the debate is
structured in these terms then then it becomes a case where you are you have
an either or situation

<ICE-SIN:S1B-026#54:1:D>
If you are if you are critical of of of sex and the arts then you
are necessarily you know pushed into the camp of of the conservatives

<ICE-SIN:S1B-026#55:1:D>
I think it's important to see uhm that in the long run

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-026#56:1:A>
Surely you don't believe that do you

<$D> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-026#57:1:D>
No to a very large extent that becomes that becomes how the
argument is is structured you see

<ICE-SIN:S1B-026#58:1:D>
If you are against sex then you are also then you are necessarily a
conservative

<ICE-SIN:S1B-026#59:1:D>
I think it's important to see that you know one has to be against
the censorship one has to say that in fact we have to open up other
possibilities of discussion while at the same time remaining very clear about
the kinds of directions we would like to go towards

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-026#60:1:C>
That the reason that is that is

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-026#61:1:A>
Censorship is not the issue you know

<ICE-SIN:S1B-026#62:1:A>
Is there too much sex

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-026#63:1:C>
Yes it is it is the issue

<$D> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-026#64:1:D>
Censorship is very much central

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-026#65:1:B>
It becomes an issue in this <unclear> word </unclear>

<$D> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-026#66:1:D>
Let me give you an example of this

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-026#67:1:A>
The censors haven't said anything yet

<ICE-SIN:S1B-026#68:1:A>
It's the it's the audience who parts of the audience who are
reacting

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-026#69:1:B>
But you see the <unclear> word </unclear> the the interesting
uh fact is that uh like Lady of Soul despite uh a big hue and cry it was sold
out and denied and people were flocking to watch it and we had to extend this
etceteras etceteras so there is obviously so to me there's there's a a
hypocrisy really because there's there's a demand but yet the we get a a big
hue and cry about uh uh Lady of Soul

<$D> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-026#70:1:D>
You see I'm glad you brought up the example of the Lady of
Soul Ken San I mean I think it's an extremely interesting play but uhm my own
feelings about having read the play is is is is basically that uhm the
playwright himself found

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-026#71:1:A>
You read the play or you saw the play

<$D> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-026#72:1:D>
I read the play unfortunate didn't see the production couldn't
get tickets it was sold out

<ICE-SIN:S1B-026#73:1:D>
Uhm but what what is most what is most what is most interesting

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-026#74:1:A>
Cliche is it

<$D> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-026#75:1:D>
What is most interesting about it was uhm that censorship
became the subtext of this play

<ICE-SIN:S1B-026#76:1:D>
It became an attempt to see how far you could push uhm the limits
of

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-026#77:1:A>
Was there any objective

<$D> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-026#78:1:D>
Legitimate not necessarily as the director I think

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-026#79:1:B>
I feel not necessarily as a director but I think that un
unfortunately or fortunately the play confronts the censorship head on you
see because of uh the issues in it and because of certain uh certain pieces
of uh of of writing so definitely the the Censorship Board had to had to
decide whether or not it was going to pass this play

<ICE-SIN:S1B-026#80:1:B>
And in fact it came back at first uh uh with lots of cuts and
subsequently because of the the of the Censorship Review Committee and
changes made to the laws uh the play was allowed to be passed

<ICE-SIN:S1B-026#81:1:B>
So inevitably I think that you within this society because it's so
reactionary anything which is uhm out of the norm is immediately questioned
through censorship

<$D> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-026#82:1:D>
I think this is this is really the point you know I mean the
the problem is that playwrights can very often be forced into a position
where they feel that you know the issue is censorship

<ICE-SIN:S1B-026#83:1:D>
The danger with this for me is that freedom the freedom of speech
becomes seen as an end in itself

<ICE-SIN:S1B-026#84:1:D>
This is a problem because censorship is a very important problem
but but I think the practitioner has to begin to recognise also that freedom
of speech is only a means to an end

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-026#85:1:C>
I think we have to acknowledge here and and and and trust the
people who are who are uhm producing this work uhm creating it that uhm
except for perhaps French lunatics most of us are interested in saying
something interested in reaching our audience

<ICE-SIN:S1B-026#86:1:C>
And uhm we we have we have things you want to say whether about sex
or about uhm other issues where sex is used as al an analogy to to to
highlight certain point

<ICE-SIN:S1B-026#87:1:C>
Whatever it is we we have serious things we do want to say and
taking that into consideration this is as this I see this as a process of
communication between the audience and yourself to sew how how to come up
with that balance or the best way to bring a message across yet keep your
audience I mean it's not

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-026#88:1:A>
But who's your audience

<ICE-SIN:S1B-026#89:1:A>
You you talk about people being reactionary isn't that a bit
arrogant on your part

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-026#90:1:C>
I didn't use the word reactionary

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-026#91:1:B>
I used the word reactionary

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-026#92:1:A>
So who's your audience Who's your audience

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-026#93:1:B>
I think that the that uh the reactionary people are actually
the media because because for me

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-026#94:1:A>
So blame it on your the media

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-026#95:1:B>
Well the audience came

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-026#96:1:A>
What media isn't here

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-026#97:1:B>
The audience came watched the show and some wrote back saying
that we hatred the show and some wrote back and said we loved the show

<ICE-SIN:S1B-026#98:1:B>
Uh but suddenly before we knew it the next week it was blown up
into an issue which uh threatened the whole state of theatre in Singapore and
that

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-026#99:1:A>
Threatened the whole state

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-026#100:1:B>
I mean it was described as threatening the state of theatre
and uh that was very interesting for me because

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-026#101:1:C>
And in fact in your opening remarks I think you said it
threatened to taint Singapore <unclear> word </unclear>

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-026#102:1:A>
Some people said it was tainting theatre

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-026#103:1:C>
Yes that's right

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-026#104:1:A>
But I think you have used along those lines right Sanjay

<$D> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-026#105:1:D>
No I I I this's precisely what I do not want to say I mean I
think it is important to see that the people who who who have problems with
the way in which sex is depicted in some plays are not arguing that in fact
the moral fabric of this society is being threatened <X>

<ICE-SIN:S1B-026#X106:1:D>
They are not arguing that we need more censorship

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-026#X107:1:A>
What are they arguing

<$D> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-026#X108:1:D>
They are arguing </X> </I>
