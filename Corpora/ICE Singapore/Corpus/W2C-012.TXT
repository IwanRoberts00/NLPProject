<h> No regrets, but I feel loss at leaving ministry: Mattar </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2C-012#3:1>
DR AHMAD Mattar looked back on his 16 years in Cabinet yesterday and
said he felt a " most heavy loss" leaving the Environment Ministry which he
has led since 1985.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-012#4:1>
In an interview with the press, he said: " It is a ministry that I
have come to cherish and love not just for its efficiency and effectiveness
but for the cohesiveness and tremendous esprit de corps among its staff.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-012#5:1>
" I have enjoyed every moment of it." The Environment Minister and
minister-in-charge of Muslim affairs, who is leaving Cabinet on June 30,
returned to this theme several times during the hour-long session at his
office.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-012#6:1>
Relaxed and affable, he entertained questions from the personal to the
political, but was at his most effusive when describing his Environment
Ministry work.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-012#7:1>
" I am leaving behind an epoch of my career which concentrated on
achieving a clean and healthy environment for Singapore," he said.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-012#8:1>
" Although this may not be as well documented as our more historical
events, our clean environment is there for all to see.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-012#9:1>
I am proud of this effort and it will always remain in my memory." In
recent years, his ministry has boosted efforts to establish Singapore as a
model green city and has ventured into environmental technology as an export
industry.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-012#10:1>
The urbane minister, who wore a silk tie and blue shirt, spoke at
length on the subject during the interview, which was interrupted once by a
telephone call from a Malaysian minister who had just heard of his decision.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-012#11:1>
He also released two letters he sent to the Prime Minister the first
seeking resignation and the second thanking and bidding farewell to Mr Goh
Chok Tong and his colleagues.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-012#12:1>
In his letter dated April 16, he said he wanted to leave " Cabinet,
if not...Parliament".

<ICE-SIN:W2C-012#13:1>
He said: " I have my reasons for wanting to go now.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-012#14:1>
It is also a promise to my wife which I have to fulfil."

<ICE-SIN:W2C-012#15:1>
He had first informed Mr Goh he wanted to leave in 1991.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-012#16:1>
But as the People's Action Party had not secured a higher percentage
of votes, he was asked to stay on.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-012#17:1>
The Prime Minister's landslide victory in the Marine Parade GRC
by-election last December prompted Dr Mattar to seek resignation again, as he
felt that the PAP had recovered political ground.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-012#18:1>
He told Mr Goh he would continue maintaining Brickworks GRC as a safe
ward for the party.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-012#19:1>
An ex-university lecturer in applied acoustics, Dr Mattar said
yesterday he had decided - after much deliberation - not to return to academia.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-012#20:1>
On his future plans, he said: " As I shall be a private citizen soon,
I would like whatever I do after July 1 to remain private...

<ICE-SIN:W2C-012#21:1>
until such time when I decide to make it known.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-012#22:1>
" I will now take stock of my life, re-assess my position in society
and give deep thought to what my heart desires." He had no regrets making the
difficult decision to leave Cabinet, he said, adding that he was equally
satisfied with his work as minister-in-charge of Muslim affairs, particularly
in education.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-012#23:1>
The formation of the self-help group Mendaki, he said, had been
instrumental in bringing the Malay MPs and Malay grassroots bodies together.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-012#24:1>
Asked why Mr Abdullah Tarmugi was promoted to minister-in-charge of
Muslim affairs - above eight other Malay MPs, Dr Mattar replied that the
appointment was decided by the Prime Minister.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-012#25:1>
He was confident that Mr Abdullah had the ability to take over his
portfolios.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-012#26:1>
As chief Malay/Muslim political leader, Dr Mattar steered the
community through some difficult times, such as during the controversial
visit of Israeli President Chaim Herzog in 1986, and when the issue of Malays
in the armed forces was raised.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-012#27:1>
Offering an insight into the ties among Malay MPs, he said that
contrary to some people's perception there were no rifts.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-012#28:1>
They might differ on issues, but always made sure they arrived at a
consensus.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-012#29:1>
As an example, he cited how they took " quite some time" to adopt a
common stand on the Gulf War in 1991 when allied forces bombed Iraq.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-012#30:1>
He said this was because some MPs saw the war as a religious battle,
while others viewed it as political.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-012#31:1>
If he seemed measured in his answers about the Malay/Muslim
community, Dr Mattar was more candid about his experience in Cabinet.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-012#32:1>
" For a while, there will be a void in my life.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-012#33:1>
I had always looked forward to Cabinet meetings," he said.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-012#34:1>
In his letter dated June 2, he thanked the Prime Minister and his
colleagues.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-012#35:1>
They had been, he said, a " source of strength, support and ideas" .

<ICE-SIN:W2C-012#36:1>
" I shall miss all of you dearly...I bid you and my other Cabinet
colleagues a fond farewell and wish you all the very best for the future.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-012#37:1>
I know there are even more challenging times ahead.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-012#38:1>
" I had served the Cabinet and the nation to the best of my ability
and I hope that I had served them well." A friendly yet firm leader and
minister FRIENDLY yet firm.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-012#39:1>
This is how those who have worked with Environment Minister Ahmad
Mattar would describe the 53 year-old leader who is leaving Cabinet at the
end of this month.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-012#40:1>
Dr Mattar's exit will be felt most palpably in the Malay community
whom he has led for mare than two decades.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-012#41:1>
He led a group of Malay MPs in 1980 to set up the Malay self-help
group, Mendaki, and was its chairman until last week.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-012#42:1>
The 1980 Census results which revealed the underperformance of the
community had prompted him and others into action.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-012#43:1>
An ex-lecturer in applied acoustics who taught in the then University
of Singapore, he was inducted into politics after several years of
involvement in Malay grassroots affairs.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-012#44:1>
On becoming MP for Leng Kee in 1972, he was appointed Parliamentary
Secretary for Education.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-012#45:1>
He became Acting Minister for Social Affairs in 1977 and full
minister later.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-012#46:1>
In 1985, he took over the Environment portfolio.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-012#47:1>
In his early years in politics, he emphasised the training of young
people and skills upgrading.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-012#48:1>
That this was a constant theme in his speeches had much to do with
his experience then as chairman of the Vocational Institute and Training
Board.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-012#49:1>
He has been at the helm of the Environment Ministry at a time of
burgeoning interest in " green" issues.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-012#50:1>
His ministry has evolved from being associated mainly with sanitation
and vector control, to being at the forefront of efforts to turn Singapore
into a model environmental city.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-012#51:1>
It launched the Clean and Green educational campaign, was behind the
Green Plan, and ventured into environmental technology as an export industry.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-012#52:1>
As the minister-in-charge of Muslim affairs, he has steered the
community through the troubled years in the early 80s when Malays were doing
especially badly in education and faced other problems, such as not being
adequately represented in the armed forces.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-012#53:1>
His speeches, always moderate in tone, often urged Malays to look to
the future. </I>

<h> Chiam quit after CEC vetoed censure move </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2C-012#55:2>
by Zuraidah Ibrahim

<ICE-SIN:W2C-012#56:2>
MR CHIAM See Tong resigned from the Singapore Democratic Party ( SDP)
after its central executive committee ( CEC) did not support his proposal to
censure one member.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-012#57:2>
This was revealed in a letter, dated June 21, to SDP cadres and
members by the party's " collective leadership" to explain the change-over.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-012#58:2>
Signed by all 13 CEC members, the letter did not say who Mr Chiam
wanted to censure.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-012#59:2>
But sources told The Straits Times that Mr Chiam had wanted to
censure his deputy Chee Soon Juan for going on a hunger strike.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-012#60:2>
Former university lecturer Dr Chee hit the headlines when he went on
a 10-day hunger strike in April, claiming that his dismissal from the
National University of Singapore was politically motivated.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-012#61:2>
The university had sacked him for the improper use of research funds
to send his wife's thesis to an American university.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-012#62:2>
The SDP, which agreed that the sacking was politically motivated, had
asked him not to go on the strike, but also said it would respect his
decision.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-012#63:2>
The letter to cadres said Mr Chiam handed in his resignation " on the
spot" on May 17 at a CEC meeting.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-012#64:2>
No CEC member present had been willing to support his motion of
censure against the particular CEC member, said the letter.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-012#65:2>
He took this as a vote of no-confidence against him.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-012#66:2>
Several attempts were made to reconcile with Mr Chiam, but to no
avail.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-012#67:2>
The two-page letter said Mr Chiam had placed unacceptable conditions.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-012#68:2>
These were not disclosed, except that they included the dismissal of
another CEC member.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-012#69:2>
After a month, Mr Chiam indicated that he was going to inform the
Registry of Societies of his resignation.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-012#70:2>
" It was then that the CEC decided that it had no choice but to make
known Mr Chiam's resignation...," said the letter.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-012#71:2>
The statement, issued on June 18, said Mr Chiam was stepping down as
part of leadership rejuvenation.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-012#72:2>
But he told reporters on the same night that he had resigned to
signal the serious differences between him and the CEC.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-012#73:2>
The letter also said he had disagreed with the CEC on issues " for a
period of time".

<ICE-SIN:W2C-012#74:2>
When contacted yesterday, Mr Chiam would only say: " What sort of
people are we dealing with here?

<ICE-SIN:W2C-012#75:2>
Their press statement said it's regeneration and now they are saying
something else...

<ICE-SIN:W2C-012#76:2>
" I would not want to wash dirty linen in public.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-012#77:2>
If there are any issues they want to force on me, I will then answer
appropriately.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-012#78:2>
I will not say more for now."

<ICE-SIN:W2C-012#79:2>
The letter to the members said the CEC was committed to collective
leadership, and that it would be the policy-making body of the party, as
laid down in its constitution.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-012#80:2>
" This is the bone of contention between the CEC and Mr Chiam.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-012#81:2>
A party calling itself democratic must have a democratic
decision-making process." It added that it had several plans, including
finding party premises, publishing a party programme and vision for
Singapore, and holding a seminar and walkabouts. </I>

<ICE-SIN:W2C-012#82:3>
<h> SDP committee blocked me on many issues: Chiam </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2C-012#83:3>
By Zuraidah Ibrahim

<ICE-SIN:W2C-012#84:3>
MR CHIAM See Tong yesterday said the Singapore Democratic Party's
central executive committee ( CEC) had blocked him on many issues, making his
vision of the opposition's role in Singapore harder to achieve.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-012#85:3>
In his first detailed interview of his sudden resignation as
secretary-general from the party he founded, he said that these differences,
including over how town councils should be run, had been unresolved for some
time now.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-012#86:3>
As he saw it, the opposition should help in nation-building.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-012#87:3>
It needed to build itself up as a credible force that did not act
irresponsibly or have in its ranks men of questionable record.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-012#88:3>
" The opposition must in fact be better than the PAP, be more honest,
work harder for the people, be more reliable.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-012#89:3>
But finding good men is easier said than done," he said in a 50
minute interview at his law firm.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-012#90:3>
And although the CEC might agree with him on these broad principles,
its members had blocked him, he said.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-012#91:3>
Mr Chiam quit as secretary-general when CEC members did not go along
with him on the motion to censure assistant secretary-general Chee Soon Juan
for his hunger strike.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-012#92:3>
Asked if he saw Dr Chee's action as an irresponsible act he said: "
In my view, he should not have gone on hunger strike.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-012#93:3>
And this is the view of the general public.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-012#94:3>
It will do more damage in the long term to the party than good.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-012#95:3>
" Mr Chiam, who remains a member of the SDP, also challenged some
details of the account of events leading to his resignation contained in a
June 21 CEC letter to members.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-012#96:3>
He said that although it gave a true picture of his resignation, it
had inaccuracies.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-012#97:3>
CEC members, he said, did not vote on his motion to censure Dr Chee
but on whether they agreed to have the motion before them.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-012#98:3>
He said he had tabled the item for the CEC meeting on May 17 but was
not allowed to discuss it by chairman Ling How Doong. <X>

<ICE-SIN:W2C-012#X99:3>
When asked why, Mr Chiam would only say: " You have to ask Mr Ling."
Mr Chiam lost when the matter was put to a vote.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-012#X100:3>
The CEC letter had said that members voted according to conscience.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-012#X101:3>
Challenging this assertion, he noted yesterday that eight out of
the 14 CEC members were " directly or indirectly employed" in Bukit Gombak
and Nee Soon Central town councils.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-012#X102:3>
Mr Ashleigh Seow, Mr Low Yong Nguan, Mr Wong Hong Toy and Mrs Chee
were in Bukit Gombak, with Mr Ling as chairman.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-012#X103:3>
Mr Francis Yong and Mr Abdul Rasheed are in Nee Soon Central which
is chaired by Mr Cheo Chai Chen.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-012#X104:3>
" I am not making any allegation.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-012#X105:3>
But what I want to ask is, if eight out of 14 are in the town
councils, can they vote according to their conscience?" he asked.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-012#X106:3>
On how his view on town councils differed from the rest, he said
there ought to be " central control" by the party over the SDP town councils
as members were elected through their party.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-012#X107:3>
" It is not right to give full powers to the MP.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-012#X108:3>
He cannot say, 'The town council is mine, I can do whatever I
like'.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-012#X109:3>
The party had a right to set broad directions, he said, but would
not elaborate.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-012#X110:3>
Referring to the CEC press statement issued on June 18 which said
his resignation was to rejuvenate the party, he said the CEC " cannot even
tell the truth".

<ICE-SIN:W2C-012#X111:3>
" I am 58 and I am fit, hale and hearty.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-012#X112:3>
So there is no reason for me to step down because of health and
age." He also revealed that he had not been told that there was a 4pm
deadline for him to respond to the statement - before it was sent to the
press.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-012#X113:3>
Dr Chee was asked, but failed, to inform him of the deadline, he
said.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-012#X114:3>
Thus he did not know it was out until he met reporters outside his
home that night.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-012#X115:3>
He had written to Mr Ling to ask the CEC to discipline Dr Chee.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-012#X116:3>
On the party being without premises, he said he had found an office
in Geylang which cost
&dollar;350,000 but members disagreed and the matter was left to Mr Cheo.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-012#X117:3>
Asked if he would consider being co-opted into the CEC, as proposed
by the committee, he replied: " They think they have great powers and they
can even co-opt Chiam See Tong, the founder of the SDP.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-012#X118:3>
This is the sort of men we have at the helm now." He added that he
hoped common sense would prevail among members, noting that the main issue
was not the squabbles but the sort of opposition needed.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-012#X119:3>
" Let's work together to establish that for the sake of country and
sake of the people." </X> </I>
