<ICE-SIN:S1B-006#1:1:A>
 Right uhm before we start the usual things again the assessment
forms please fill it in and uh pass it to your class reps who will give it to
the G.O.

<ICE-SIN:S1B-006#2:1:A>
 Okay my code instructor code 2180 64

<ICE-SIN:S1B-006#3:1:A>
 Now we are going to do letters of credit today but before we move on
to that I want to just uhm summarise some points about the mortgages like our
tutorial we had

<ICE-SIN:S1B-006#4:1:A>
 This is to uh enable some of you who were not quite finished the
last time to <unclear> word </unclear> take note and then we can go on to
letters of credit so this part won't be too much of a discussion hope you
don't mind about that

<ICE-SIN:S1B-006#5:1:A>
 The mortgages tutorial question three was essentially a tutorial on
land titles mortgages

<ICE-SIN:S1B-006#6:1:A>
 Okay and before I go on to that actually there's a point on question
two which I want to uh mention which I missed the last time and this is in
relation to two b where the mortgage jobs lease have been terminated by his
lessor

<ICE-SIN:S1B-006#7:1:A>
 Okay we mention that his primary remedy would be a covenant I mean a
suit upon the personal covenant

<ICE-SIN:S1B-006#8:1:A>
 Uh under section eighteen of the CLPA there is also provision for
the mortgagee to go to court and apply for what is called a relief okay from
from a relief

<ICE-SIN:S1B-006#9:1:A>
 In uh in other words asking the court to say look I've got interests
this guy can move in but surely he's got to think about me

<ICE-SIN:S1B-006#10:1:A>
 Could you ask him to give me some money at least you know that sort
of thing

<ICE-SIN:S1B-006#11:1:A>
 So an application for relief Section eighteen CLPA

<ICE-SIN:S1B-006#12:1:A>
 Okay so now question three the same sets of facts but uhm two a
which say that as far as that is concerned uhm the PLA has got uh provision
for entry possession

<ICE-SIN:S1B-006#13:1:A>
 The difference between LPA entry and CLPA entry is that under the
LPA the mortgagee has got to give notice the one month notice before he moves
in and his notice is given only if there is default

<ICE-SIN:S1B-006#14:1:A>
 Okay if you remember under Common Law the mortgagee's right to
enter is at any time even before the ink is dry on the deed

<ICE-SIN:S1B-006#15:1:A>
 But in this case in the LTA your entry must be upon default

<ICE-SIN:S1B-006#16:1:A>
 Since there is default here that point is academic

<ICE-SIN:S1B-006#17:1:A>
 That's three a Three b I mention that uh once you look at the
register the register is everything so if you see a mortgage there the lessor
would have to take subject to the mortgagee's interest

<ICE-SIN:S1B-006#18:1:A>
 That's quite obvious because everything is on the register he would
have noticed even if he didn't read it actually he's got constructive notice
that there is a prior party so that he when he forfeits the lease of the
lessee he takes that land back for himself that is he must take it subject to
the mortgagee's interest okay

<ICE-SIN:S1B-006#19:1:A>
 And we've got that as a basic principle and it's supported of
course by the LTA

<ICE-SIN:S1B-006#20:1:A>
 The LTA has got section sixty-two which says that when the lessor
and the lessee's interests are merged in this case it has become uh merged in
one person's name

<ICE-SIN:S1B-006#21:1:A>
 Then what happen is that lessor that person who took the merged
interest would have to pay off the mortgagee section sixty-two LTA and
furthermore we find that there is a section fifty-nine sub-section
sub-section one of the LTA again which states that a transferee <O> cough </O>
excuse me a transferee must uhm either pay off the mortgagee that means
discharge him or perform the obligations of the mortgage

<ICE-SIN:S1B-006#22:1:A>
 So in this case section fifty-nine one is also useful for the
mortgaging so you find that for under the LTA the mortgager's position is
much happier is not so long of course as he's registered okay regis the regis
the register is everything therefore the mortgagee must register

<ICE-SIN:S1B-006#23:1:A>
 Most cases you find they do

<ICE-SIN:S1B-006#24:1:A>
 Once it's registered his rights are there in the LTA section
fifty-nine one question sixty-two okay

<ICE-SIN:S1B-006#25:1:A>
 Three b Three c is an oral contract which means it's an equitable
mortgage

<ICE-SIN:S1B-006#26:1:A>
 Under the LTA you can have equitable mortgages

<ICE-SIN:S1B-006#27:1:A>
 It is recognised implicitly in section thirty-seven two which says
that once you have contractual rights the LTA does not invalidate those
contractual rights

<ICE-SIN:S1B-006#28:1:A>
 It is also expressly accepted in a case decided by our former Chief
Justice

<ICE-SIN:S1B-006#29:1:A>
 The case called Bank of China uh Bank of China versus official
assignee nineteen eighty three case Bank of China's case

<ICE-SIN:S1B-006#30:1:A>
 Now we know generally that the remedies of the LTA mortgagee are
the same as he has been Common Law the section sixty-four LTA says so

<ICE-SIN:S1B-006#31:1:A>
 Section LT four uh section sixty-four basically says that the CLPA
and all your Common Law rights apply mutatis mutandis

<ICE-SIN:S1B-006#32:1:A>
 Okay I explain because it's got something it's got nothing to do
with the ninja turtles but nonetheless the root word is the same mutations so
uh mu mutatis mutandis section sixty-four says that the CLPA applies with
appropriate changes in other words okay

<ICE-SIN:S1B-006#33:1:A>
 The appropriate changes meaning for example when the CLPA talks
about say a free-hold owner you just change it to registered proprietor
terminology of the LTA

<ICE-SIN:S1B-006#34:1:A>
 Uh when the CLPA says you've got a right for closure you look at
the LTA you find that the uh those rights mentioned in CLPA are slightly
modified in section seventy seven zero of the LTA okay so mutatis mutandis

<ICE-SIN:S1B-006#35:1:A>
 So in this case then if the LTA recogises an equitable mortgage
then obviously what you have in common law the equitable mortgagee's rights
those are more or less similar in the LTA's system

<ICE-SIN:S1B-006#36:1:A>
 Three d there is no mention anywhere at the and the LTA that the
rules about fixtures have been abolished so you can say that in this sense
the LTA is silent about fixtures therefore Common Law applies

<ICE-SIN:S1B-006#37:1:A>
 You could also actually look at section four definition of land
section four LTA defines land to include uhm structures affixed thereon for
example and I think you could read that to mean that the law of fixtures mean
the same okay

<ICE-SIN:S1B-006#38:1:A>
 That's three d and therefore the answer should be the same as in
two d

<ICE-SIN:S1B-006#39:1:A>
 Three e when we talk about relevant <unclear> word </unclear> of
course we're talking about the LTA

<ICE-SIN:S1B-006#40:1:A>
 The mortgage has not been registered under the LTA which means it
is not valid

<ICE-SIN:S1B-006#41:1:A>
 It is not recognised by the LTA as a legal mortgage since it's not
registered and since the register is everything

<ICE-SIN:S1B-006#42:1:A>
 This is not a valid legal legal mortgage

<ICE-SIN:S1B-006#43:1:A>
 Nonetheless the LTA does recognise an equitable mortgage as we said
earlier that equitable mortgage cannot be registered but you can lodge a
caveat in respect of that interest

<ICE-SIN:S1B-006#44:1:A>
 The purpose of lodging a caveat is basically to warn okay caveat
means warning to warn the whole world at large that okay I don't have a
registered interest but you better transact with my interest in mind

<ICE-SIN:S1B-006#45:1:A>
 I am an equitable mortgagee I may not have very strong rights but
you must remember me when you talk to the registered proprietor so this is
different from the RODA RODA basically as I said earlier on registration does
not affect validity

<ICE-SIN:S1B-006#46:1:A>
 If you're already valid under the Common Law you remain valid even
if you don't register

<ICE-SIN:S1B-006#47:1:A>
 If you originally were invalid registration does not make you valid
so the RODA does not affect validity but if you were a valid legal mortgage
and you are number one in the queue you do want to continue being number one
and in this case therefore you want to register because if you don't register
you're going you're going to lose out

<ICE-SIN:S1B-006#48:1:A>
 You're going to lose your place in the queue and there's no point
saying I've got a legal mortgage it is valid therefore I have a power of sale
but you're number ten

<ICE-SIN:S1B-006#49:1:A>
 By the time you come to exercise the power of sale there's nothing
to sell right

<ICE-SIN:S1B-006#50:1:A>
 So you want to be first in line you register

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-006#51:1:B>
 <unclear> word </unclear> being a legal mortgage ah doesn't it
rank you ahead of the rest already

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-006#52:1:A>
 Yes no because if you don't register you don't have priorities
so the fact that you are legal mortgage doesn't matter now because the RODA
changes your rights of priority section four basically and section fourteen
of the RODA okay

<ICE-SIN:S1B-006#53:1:A>
 Section section four says you must register section fourteen says
once you register you are preserving your priority

<ICE-SIN:S1B-006#54:1:A>
 Consequently if you don't register you don't preserve your priority

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-006#55:1:B>
 Sir then when will it go when the equi the legal mor mortgage
was prevailed

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-006#56:1:A>
 When okay that was all the all the rules about legal over
equitable and all that apply when there is no statutory amendment

<ICE-SIN:S1B-006#57:1:A>
 So for fixed charges and closing charges when they talk about
ranking of course the legal prevails and the fixed prevails

<ICE-SIN:S1B-006#58:1:A>
 Again they you talk about priority in other areas of property law
which hasn't been changed the statute

<ICE-SIN:S1B-006#59:1:A>
 The ranking is there

<ICE-SIN:S1B-006#60:1:A>
 It's it's a general framework of law

<ICE-SIN:S1B-006#61:1:A>
 The ranking is given by Common Law but Common Common Law can be
prevailed can be overruled by statute and in land it has been overruled by
the RODA and by the LTA okay

<ICE-SIN:S1B-006#62:1:A>
 So remember those rules I taught you earlier as a sort of
background or a base on which now you are building new knowledge and that's
the RODA and the LTA okay

<ICE-SIN:S1B-006#63:1:A>
 Right now in this case registration uh non registration rather non
registration would make the mortgage invalid unless it can be construed as an
equitable mortgage in which case it's got the right of an equitable mortgagee
I mean the the the mortgagee will have the right to the equitable mortgagee
and that's another different story

<ICE-SIN:S1B-006#64:1:A>
 The whole idea of the LTA is that once you've got registered land
you don't have to look anywhere to search for title to search for who is the
owner who has got a charge who's got a mortgage who's got a pledge whatever
everything is on the register and that simple statement every the register is
everything comes from Privy Council case actually and you could remember that
as a quotable quote the register is everything

<ICE-SIN:S1B-006#65:1:A>
 Exception of course is actual fraud

<ICE-SIN:S1B-006#66:1:A>
 When you have actual fraud then the person who's been defrauded can
go to court and upset or erase the registration so to speak okay rectify the
register okay

<ICE-SIN:S1B-006#67:1:A>
 That's two e and therefore two f is basically the same answer

<ICE-SIN:S1B-006#68:1:A>
 The unregistered mortgage it doesn't matter whether you are legal
or equitable in this case once you're unregistered you do not have priority

<ICE-SIN:S1B-006#69:1:A>
 Of course the registered legal mortgage will take priority

<ICE-SIN:S1B-006#70:1:A>
 One small little refinement to this point if the unregistered
mortgage is an equitable mortgage you can't you can't register it at all
under LTA and since you can't register it there is no fight because here
we've got a interest that is unregisterable versus an interest which is
registerable and between these two then the the ah equitable mortgagee must
lodge a caveat to preserve his priority

<ICE-SIN:S1B-006#71:1:A>
 If he doesn't lodge a caveat I would think he remains outside the
register and therefore he has no right at all

<ICE-SIN:S1B-006#72:1:A>
 Now in this case you would want to note the difference between the
RODA system and the LTA

<ICE-SIN:S1B-006#73:1:A>
 Remember I said that under the RODA whether you are equitable or
you're legal you are both registerable

<ICE-SIN:S1B-006#74:1:A>
 You are both registered registerable under the RODA and therefore
you've you have competing interests if one doesn't register

<ICE-SIN:S1B-006#75:1:A>
 In the LTA system only legal mortgages can be registered and the
equitable mortgage if you want to preserve your prio priority you have to
caveat your interest okay

<ICE-SIN:S1B-006#76:1:A>
 And that sums up everything you need to know about LTA

<ICE-SIN:S1B-006#77:1:A>
 Questions

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-006#78:1:B>
 Sir when you lodge a caveat right does he rank uh ahead of the
legal mortgage <X>

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-006#X79:1:A>
 Well the caveat is a sort of notice to the world

<ICE-SIN:S1B-006#X80:1:A>
 Re remember if you remember your fixed charge lectures your first
charge is a floating charge

<ICE-SIN:S1B-006#X81:1:A>
 A second charge comes along and it's a fixed charge Now the fixed
charge prevails over the floating charge you jump the queue if you're a fixed
charge but if you are a fixed charge with notice of a negative pledge cross
up here then you take with notice and therefore you take subject to that
floating charge interest right Same thing here you've got an equitable
mortgage caveated notice to all subsequent people that I've got an equitable
mortgage then a legal legal mortgage comes along it's registered but it's
registered subject to that interest because there is notice either actual or
constructive okay Right Further questions Okay no further questions we move
on to our letters of credit and firts question you are now employed by this
bank very progressive bank It wants to entertain the customers' wish If you
can solve the problems that the requests ah raise So now we want to discuss
these problems and see whether it can accede to the customers' requests Okay
so Mr Big your customer first request electronic communication facilities for
credit Can you accede to that request Would you Are there any problems Mr Big
just wants communication facilites to apply for credits to notify his
beneficiary to notify himself that his credit has been opened basically that
Can you do it Yes No Yes or no S2: Yes

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-006#X82:1:A>
 Yes Who says no Anyone thinks you won't request uh you won't
accede to the request So you think yes All of you think yes Are there no
problems then What problems do you think there might be in this case Any
problem Okay the technical problems we're not going to discuss them here but
anyway this is not a problem because technology exists to allow the customer
to communicate with this bank by electronic communications right So it exists
The modem is quite cheap the telephone is quite cheap your fax machine all
these things are on fact quite common So it's not the question of technology
Is there a legal problem Is there a legal problem here What sort what sort of
problem do you have here if you think there is a problem Anyone </X> </I>
