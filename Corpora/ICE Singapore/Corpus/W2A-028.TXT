<ICE-SIN:W2A-028#5:1>
The human immunodeficiency virus type I ( HIV) has been etiologically
identified as the primary cause of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (
AIDS) [ 1,2].

<ICE-SIN:W2A-028#6:1>
HIV-I is the prototypical member of the Lentivirinae subfamily of
retroviruses affecting humans.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-028#7:1>
The lentiviruses characteristically cause indolent infections in their
animal hosts and these infections commonly involve the nervous system,
producing long periods of clinical latency, and weak humoral immune
responses.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-028#8:1>
Globally, the World Health Organization estimates that 6 to 8 million
people are currently infected with HIV-I and it is predicted that 15 to 20
million people will be seropositive for the virus by the year 2000 [ 3].

<ICE-SIN:W2A-028#9:1>
HIV-I is spread by sexual contact, exposure to infected blood or blood
products, and perinatal transmission from mother to child.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-028#10:1>
Clearly, AIDS represents an international health crisis, and the
development of drug therapies and effective vaccines depends substantially on
a more complete understanding of this pathogenic retrovirus.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-028#11:1>
<h> The HIV-I Genomic Structure and Virion </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-028#12:1>
Most retroviruses that are capable of replication contain only three
genes - namely, gag, pol and env [ 4].

<ICE-SIN:W2A-028#13:1>
The gag and env genes encode the core nucleocapsid polypeptides and
surface-coat proteins of the virus, respectively, while the pol gene gives
rise to the viral reverse transcriptase and other enzymes.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-028#14:1>
HIV-I, however, contains in its 9 kilobase RNA genome, not only these
three essential genes but at least six additional regulatory genes ( vif,
vpu, vpr, tat, rev and nef) [ Figure 1].

<ICE-SIN:W2A-028#15:1>
It is the concerted action of these additional genes that probably
underlie the profound pathogenicity of HIV-I.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-028#16:1>
High resolution electron microscopy has revealed the HIV-I virion as
an icosahedral structure containing 72 external spikes.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-028#17:1>
These spikes are formed by the two major envelope proteins, gp 120
and gp4 1 [ Figure 2].

<ICE-SIN:W2A-028#18:1>
The core of HIV-I contains four nucleocapsid proteins,p17,p24,p9 and
p7.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-028#19:1>
The p24 protein forms the chief component of the inner leaflet of the
nucleocapsid, whereas the myristylated pl7 protein is associated with the
inner surface of the lipid bilayer.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-028#20:1>
The p7 protein binds directly to the genomic RNA through a
zinc-finger structural motif and together with p9 forms the nucleoid core.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-028#21:1>
<h> Life cycle of HIV-I </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-028#22:1>
The first step in the infectious cycle of HIV-I involves the
attachment of the virion to a target cell.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-028#23:1>
The human CD4+ T lymphocytes and monocytes are the major cellular
targets [ 5].

<ICE-SIN:W2A-028#24:1>
HIV-I specifically infects these cells because the CD4 membrane
antigen represents the principal, if not sole high-affinity cellular receptor
for this retrovirus.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-028#25:1>
The HIV-I gp l20 envelope protein is found to bind to CD4 with
strikingly high affinity.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-028#26:1>
The role of CD4 as the viral receptor has prompted considerable
interest in the therapeutic use of soluble CD4 protein as " receptor decoys"
to block HIV-I infection [ 6].

<ICE-SIN:W2A-028#27:1>
Recent studies, however, show that primary viral isolates are
resistant to such soluble CD4 analogues.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-028#28:1>
Other problems encountered with short biological half-life and poor
tissue penetration limit the usefulness of soluble CD4 as an antiviral agent.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-028#29:1>
Besides T-cells and monocytes, HIV-I may also infect other types of
cells, including glial cells, gut epithelium and bone marrow progenitors.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-028#30:1>
Whether HIV-I infection of these diverse cell types is mediated
exclusively through CD4 or involves another cellular receptor remains an area
of active investigation.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-028#31:1>
<h> Internalization and reverse transcription </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-028#32:1>
The HIV-I virion is brought inside the cell via virus-mediated
membranefusion [ 7], a process involving the viral gp4 1 envelope protein.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-028#33:1>
After internalization, the HIV-I virion is rapidly uncoated and
enters the replicative phase of its life cycle.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-028#34:1>
Viral replication begins with the generation of first-strand DNA copy
of the viral RNA by the viral reverse transcriptase.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-028#35:1>
Second-strand DNA synthesis then proceeds after the viral
ribonuclease H digests the original RNA template yielding a The most
successful therapeutic drugs used in the treatment of HIV-I infection are
dideoxynucleosides, agents which specifically inhibit the action of the viral
reverse transcriptase [ 8].

<ICE-SIN:W2A-028#36:1>
These compounds include 3'azido-2', 3'-dideoxythymidine ( zidovudine,
AZT), 2'3'dideoxycytidine ( ddC) and 2'3'dideoxyinosine ( ddI).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-028#37:1>
Each of these compounds is phosphorylated to an active triphosphate
form after entry into the cell and acts either as a chain terminator of the
first strand DNA or as a simple competitor to the normal deoxynucleoside - 5 '
- triphosphate.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-028#38:1>
The viral reverse transcriptase appears to incorporate these
dideoxynucleoside analogues preferentially, thus explaining their therapeutic
effectiveness.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-028#39:1>
Zidovudine has been shown to prolong survival and reduce the
frequency and severity of opportunistic infections in patients with AIDS.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-028#40:1>
<h> Viral Latency </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-028#41:1>
Upon entry into a susceptible cell, HIV-I may establish a latent or
persistent form of infection.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-028#42:1>
It has been estimated that for every T-cell actively producing the
virus, nine other T-cells contain the latent virus.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-028#43:1>
The biochemical basis of this apparent viral latency is poorly
understood but may be determined by the overall state of cellular activation.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-028#44:1>
Many viruses, including HIV-I, do not replicate in resting T-cells,
presumably because critical host factors are absent.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-028#45:1>
However, the activation of these T-cells by antigens, mitogens,
cytokines ( tumor necrosis factor-alpha or interleukin-l) or gene products of
other viruses ( human T-cell leukemia virus type l, herpes simplex virus,
human herpes virus type 6) creates a permissive environment for HIV-I
replication 191.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-028#46:1>
These activating agents are known to induce the expression of host
transcription factors, initiatung cell growth and thus, HIV-I replication.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-028#47:1>
<h> Morphogenesis of the HIV-I Virion </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-028#48:1>
Assembly of the HIV virion proceeds via a stepwise manner, involving
aggregation of the nbonucleoprotein core in the cytoplasm.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-028#49:1>
The gene products of the gag and pol genes, together with the vital
RNA form the core of the mature virion.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-028#50:1>
Once assembled, these cores move to the cell surface and bud through
the plasma membrane, where they acquire their envelope proteins, gene
products of the env gene.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-028#51:1>
During the budding process, a series of cleavage events occur,
mediated by the HIV-I protease.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-028#52:1>
The Gag polyprotein is cleaved to yield the pl7, p24, p9 and p7
proteins, and the pol gene precursor cleaved to produce the viral enzymes,
the reverse transcriptase, integrase, ribonuclease and protease.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-028#53:1>
The HIV-I protease has long been the target of investigators working
on antiviral therapeutic agents.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-028#54:1>
The protease protein has been purified and crystallised [ l0], and
its intrinsic three dimensional structural information has been used in the
rational development of specific inhibitors.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-028#55:1>
<h> Development of an HIV-I vaccine </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-028#56:1>
Early studies in the field of vaccine development for HIV-I have
shown that the successful design of a vaccine would be complicated by the
sequence variation of the Env protein.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-028#57:1>
The hyperimmunization of chimpanzees with HIV-I Env protein was
insufficient to protect the animals from challenge with even small quantities
of the same strain of HIV-I [ ll].

<ICE-SIN:W2A-028#58:1>
Although these initial results seemed discouraging,later studies in
the SIV-I ( Simian Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1) system suggest that an
effective HIV-I vaccine may be an achievable goal.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-028#59:1>
Inactivated whole-virus-based SIV-I vaccines can confer protective
immunity on Rhesus monkeys challenged with low doses of live SIV-I [ l2].

<ICE-SIN:W2A-028#60:1>
However, concerns about insufficient inactivation and inadequate
animal models for safety testing restrict the use of whole inactivated HIV in
seronegative humans.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-028#61:1>
Most efforts to date, have therefore been focussed on subunit
vaccines.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-028#62:1>
Recently, protective immunity was observed in macaques immunised with
recombinant vaccinia virus expressing SIV-env protein, boosted with Env
protein produced in baculovirus-infected cells [ 13].

<ICE-SIN:W2A-028#63:1>
A similar combination immunization approach is now under evaluation
in humans as a candidate AIDS vaccine [ 14].

<ICE-SIN:W2A-028#64:1>
It remains to be shown, however, whether recombinant subunit vaccines
can protect against heterologous virus challenge. </I>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-028#68:2>
The Plasmodium parasite, the causative agent of malaria, is a major
scourge of mankind.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-028#69:2>
Some 270 million people have been infected with malaria during the
past 20 years and more than a million people die of it every year.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-028#70:2>
As early as the seventeenth century, extracts from the bark of the
cinchona tree were known to be effective in the treatment of the disease.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-028#71:2>
In the 19th century, quinine, a quinoline alkaloid, was identified as
the active antimalarial compound in the cinchona bark.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-028#72:2>
Quinine was widely used until it was superseded by chloroquine which
was first synthesized by Resochin in Germany in 1934.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-028#73:2>
Chloroquine is the single most successful anti-malarial drug ever
developed and has been credited with saving the lives of countless millions
of people.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-028#74:2>
Despite the enormous benefits derived from its use over the past half
century, its mechanism of action had been a mystery.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-028#75:2>
A significant breakthrough in the war against malaria was the
publication of a recent report by Slater and Cerami ( Nature 355; 167-169,
1992) which revealed the mechanism of action of the drug.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-028#76:2>
This discovery may revolutionize the way in which future
anti-malarial drugs will be developed.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-028#77:2>
The life cycle of the Plasmodium parasite consists of a sexual phase
in the intestine of the mosquito and an asexual multiplication phase within
the liver parenchyma cells and the erythrocytes ofthe human host.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-028#78:2>
Chloroquine and related quinoline-containing anti-malarials are
effective only against the intra-erythrocytic stages of the Plasmodium life
cycle.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-028#79:2>
Rapid multiplication ofthe parasite within the erythrocytes results
in a high demand for nutrients which are partly haemoglobin in acid food
vacuoles of the parasites.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-028#80:2>
However, the digestion of the abundant haemoglobin is not without its
drawbacks.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-028#81:2>
Breakdown of haemoglobin releases large amounts of haem which is
toxic because it can damage biological membranes and inhibit a variety of
enzymes.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-028#82:2>
The human host has an elaborate system in the reticuloendothelial
cells of the liver, spleen and bone marrow for the degradation and excretion
of haem.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-028#83:2>
Unlike the human host, the parasite is unable to degrade and excrete
haem.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-028#84:2>
It can only sequester haem in its food vacuoles by incorporating it
into an insoluble crystalline material called haemozoin.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-028#85:2>
Haemozoin is a polymer of haem formed by covalently linking the
central ferric ion of one haem to a side-chain carboxylate oxygen of another.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-028#86:2>
This polymeric form of haem is harmless to the parasite.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-028#87:2>
However, haem molecules do not spontaneously polymerise into
haemozoin under physiological conditions.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-028#88:2>
The polymerisation of haem into haemozoin requires an enzyme which
Slater and Cerami identified in extracts of Plasmodium falciparum
trophozoites.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-028#89:2>
The pH optimum of the haem polymerase is between pH 5.0 and 6.0,
which covers the estimated pH of the parasite's food vacuoles.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-028#90:2>
They observed that chloroquine and its analogs potently inhibited the
activity of the polymerase.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-028#91:2>
Inhibition of the polymerase occurred at a drug concentration and pH
similar to that estimated in the parasite's food vacuoles.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-028#92:2>
The rank order of potencies by which different analogs of chloroquine
inhibited the polymerase is also the same as the rank order of their
anti-malarial activity.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-028#93:2>
With the discovery of the physiological target of the quinoline -
containing anti-malarial drugs, the development of new drugs will now be
greatly facilitated.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-028#94:2>
Research can now be focused on the structural requirements for the
inhibition of the haem polymerase.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-028#95:2>
This discovery is timely as there is now a resurgence in the
world-wide incidence of malaria.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-028#96:2>
New strains of mosquito vector resistant to insecticides and mutant
forms of the malarial parasite resistant to drugs have contributed to the
current increase in malarial infection. </I>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-028#101:3>
Iron under physiological conditions tends to hydrolyse and
polymerise, forming essentially insoluble ferric hydroxides and
oxyhydroxides.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-028#102:3>
To maintain iron in a soluble form, biological systems possess
special proteins which bind Fe ions with high affinity, leaving very little
free iron in solution.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-028#103:3>
An important example of such iron-binding proteins is ferritin, the
iron - storage protein found in both animals and plants.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-028#104:3>
It serves the dual function of maintaining iron in a biologically
available form and protecting the organism against the toxic effects of
excess iron.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-028#105:3>
For example, in mammalian systems, when iron is absorbed from the
small intestine, it immediately combines with a b-globulin, apotransferrin,
to form transferrin, which is circulated in the blood plasma.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-028#106:3>
The iron bound by transfenrin is in turn taken up by a wide range of
cells, particularly in the liver, spleen and the intestinal mucosae, and is
eventually stored as ferritin within the cytoplasm. <X>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-028#X107:3>
<h> Ferritin Structure and Function </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-028#X108:3>
Ferritin is formed from an iron core of ferric oxyhydroxide
crystals and a 24-subunit coat of non-heme proteins called apoferritin.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-028#X109:3>
The apoferritin subunits may vary in amino acid sequence and
polypeptide chain length ( 174 to 183 residues), thus contributing to the
complexity and heterogeniety in the structure and composition of the
apoferritin macromolecule. </X> </I>
