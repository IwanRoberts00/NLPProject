The flow the fabric the beauty of fashion

<ICE-SIN:S2B-026#2:1:A>
Mystic magic glitz glamour the world of clothes has it all

<ICE-SIN:S2B-026#3:1:A>
It's the world of thieves to be controlled from New York Milan and
Paris

<ICE-SIN:S2B-026#4:1:A>
Ladies <unclear> word </unclear> are ambassadors for the great
fashion houses

<ICE-SIN:S2B-026#5:1:A>
But the catalogues of Singapore are also travelling apart to the top
of fashion world

<ICE-SIN:S2B-026#6:1:A>
But amidst the applause there's still a long way to go

<ICE-SIN:S2B-026#7:1:A>
Local labels are making their mark but only locally

<ICE-SIN:S2B-026#8:1:A>
There's still a wide world out there where Singapore designers must
boldly go or get behind in the race

<ICE-SIN:S2B-026#9:1:A>
But to get there how does Singapore designers offer that special
touch

<ICE-SIN:S2B-026#10:1:A>
Thomas Wee has been in the local fashion business for more than
twenty years

<ICE-SIN:S2B-026#11:1:A>
Now he's gone international selling his designs in Japan

<ICE-SIN:S2B-026#12:1:A>
He's trying to capture that distinctive look but so far overseas
opportunities have been few

<ICE-SIN:S2B-026#13:1:A>
But what can be done to use the familiar heritage we have to
advantage

<ICE-SIN:S2B-026#14:1:A>
Designers in the past have tried to incorporate the different
ethnic styles into one and recently we have the Singapore dress with orchid
motifs

<ICE-SIN:S2B-026#15:1:A>
For one young designer who gets much of her inspiration from
Chinatown Khee tries to bring together East and West fusing together new and
old

<ICE-SIN:S2B-026#16:1:A>
Khee is looking for designs which have that distinctive look

<ICE-SIN:S2B-026#17:1:A>
She spends hours searching for that special something

<ICE-SIN:S2B-026#18:1:A>
Perhaps surprisingly it seems local fashion isn't as vibrant as it
looks

<ICE-SIN:S2B-026#19:1:A>
But how do you feel the pulse of the international fashion beat

<ICE-SIN:S2B-026#20:1:A>
It's more than just looking inwards

<ICE-SIN:S2B-026#21:1:A>
Shaping a fashion business is all about people

<ICE-SIN:S2B-026#22:1:A>
It can't be done alone but putting together the right theme seems
to frustrate most local designers

<ICE-SIN:S2B-026#23:1:A>
The unanswered questions are trained workers and backup

<ICE-SIN:S2B-026#24:1:A>
There's a feeling that there's not enough response to the demands
of the industry

<ICE-SIN:S2B-026#25:1:A>
In fact there are now courses in marketing but they're very new

<ICE-SIN:S2B-026#26:1:A>
The La Salle International Fashion School runs classes especially
for the industry with the help from the Economic Development Board

<ICE-SIN:S2B-026#27:1:A>
Students learn the rudiments of fashion retail all aspects of the
business and above all how to sell

<ICE-SIN:S2B-026#28:1:A>
Marketing the cornerstone of fashion and a solid business base

<ICE-SIN:S2B-026#29:1:A>
But a designer still needs ideas

<ICE-SIN:S2B-026#30:1:A>
So La Salle emphasizes good designs

<ICE-SIN:S2B-026#31:1:A>
Getting that good design is a painstaking business and it's vital
for students to get that hands on experience

<ICE-SIN:S2B-026#32:1:A>
The idea of practical training seems to have grabbed many

<ICE-SIN:S2B-026#33:1:A>
It's a crucial new trend for would be fashion makers after all
they're the industry's leaders of the future

<ICE-SIN:S2B-026#34:1:A>
And hands on training is a start in the establishment of Singapore
as a fashion training centre for the Asia-Pacific

<ICE-SIN:S2B-026#35:1:A>
From cutting room to cat-walk the young designers have a lot
resting on them the future of the whole industry

<ICE-SIN:S2B-026#36:1:A>
This is a traditional way of looking for bargains in fashion
accessories

<ICE-SIN:S2B-026#37:1:A>
Soon there'll be a way of looking for the new fashion trends as
well

<ICE-SIN:S2B-026#38:1:A>
That's when the fashion resource centre opens this year

<ICE-SIN:S2B-026#39:1:A>
Unlike the present situation buyers and sellers will be able to do
business in a more conducive atmosphere

<ICE-SIN:S2B-026#40:1:A>
At the moment getting the right fashion or design is mainly a
question of luck

<ICE-SIN:S2B-026#41:1:A>
The same is true where it comes to textiles

<ICE-SIN:S2B-026#42:1:A>
Often Singapore buyers are a season behind

<ICE-SIN:S2B-026#43:1:A>
Their choices while the best are often illusive

<ICE-SIN:S2B-026#44:1:A>
This sort of deal goes on all the time in the textile business

<ICE-SIN:S2B-026#45:1:A>
But it's often time consuming and mostly expensive for the buyer

<ICE-SIN:S2B-026#46:1:A>
So plans are afoot to establish Singapore's own fabric centre

<ICE-SIN:S2B-026#47:1:A>
Becoming recognised internationally that's what Esther Tay aspires
to be

<ICE-SIN:S2B-026#48:1:A>
She's just returned from Tokyo where her collection was exhibited
along with big names like Ungaro and Tierry Mugler

<ICE-SIN:S2B-026#49:1:A>
It's a difficult to penetrate and she has to take into
consideration the preferences of the Japanese

<ICE-SIN:S2B-026#50:1:A>
While Esther concentrates on the design her husband Paul helps to
market her clothes and there are ambitious plans to sell a total boutique
concept to American retailers

<ICE-SIN:S2B-026#51:1:A>
With the number of orders coming in thick and fast how's the
company going to manage

<ICE-SIN:S2B-026#52:1:A>
Actually going global is a big step to take

<ICE-SIN:S2B-026#53:1:A>
But right in the heart of London that's where one Singapore
designer has decided to take on the best of Britain

<ICE-SIN:S2B-026#54:1:A>
In fact the operation was so successful that within a year a second
Celia Loe boutique is being planned

<ICE-SIN:S2B-026#55:1:A>
How did Celia succeed and what are the problems faced in making
inroads overseas

<ICE-SIN:S2B-026#56:1:A>
To satisfy the discerning taste of her clientele Celia churns out
nearly ninety designs a month

<ICE-SIN:S2B-026#57:1:A>
To stay one up she has gone high-tech

<ICE-SIN:S2B-026#58:1:A>
Her patterns and measurements are all done with the aid of a
computer

<ICE-SIN:S2B-026#59:1:A>
However Celia believes in that personal touch

<ICE-SIN:S2B-026#60:1:A>
Despite a tight schedule she supervises a team of cutters and
seamstresses to ensure the right quality

<ICE-SIN:S2B-026#61:1:A>
But this operation is an exception

<ICE-SIN:S2B-026#62:1:A>
Some feel that to make an impact overseas Singapore has to identify
itself as part of the Asean group

<ICE-SIN:S2B-026#63:1:A>
To wear fashion like this you have to be young and you have to be
young to think of the designs

<ICE-SIN:S2B-026#64:1:A>
The Asean young designers' contest throws up the best in the region
and it does something more

<ICE-SIN:S2B-026#65:1:A>
It's a channel of expression making Asean countries together and
maybe Singapore will be refocused

<ICE-SIN:S2B-026#66:1:A>
To attract Asean designers to set up base here last year's winner
from the Phillipines won a scholarship to study at the La Salle International
Fashion School

<ICE-SIN:S2B-026#67:1:A>
In the mean time local fashion makers are grouping together to
create an impact

<ICE-SIN:S2B-026#68:1:A>
Style Singapore a joint effort by the local fashion trade is a
retail outlet which showcases some sixty local designers

<ICE-SIN:S2B-026#69:1:A>
Some fledgling others more established

<ICE-SIN:S2B-026#70:1:A>
Style Singapore is modeled after London's exclusive Birlington
Arcade and it hopes to be a showcase of Singapore fashion

<ICE-SIN:S2B-026#71:1:A>
Designs to catch the eye and they're mainly from younger designers
who come out of school and display their wares

<ICE-SIN:S2B-026#72:1:A>
These represent the first step to sell Singapore fashion abroad

<ICE-SIN:S2B-026#73:1:A>
Another idea is to sell the rights to a Singapore label overseas

<ICE-SIN:S2B-026#74:1:A>
Si-ann was the first to launch its Singapore range as normal styles

<ICE-SIN:S2B-026#75:1:A>
Launched in October last year Si-ann is the first Singapore
retailer to go global through franchising

<ICE-SIN:S2B-026#76:1:A>
At the moment it's concentrating on the regional market Malaysia
Indonesia Brunei and Thailand

<ICE-SIN:S2B-026#77:1:A>
But its eventual aim is to go completely international

<ICE-SIN:S2B-026#78:1:A>
The idea of franchising was supported by the Trade Development
Board

<ICE-SIN:S2B-026#79:1:A>
Their intention is to look at different ways of going global

<ICE-SIN:S2B-026#80:1:A>
At the moment Singapore has attracted many international labels

<ICE-SIN:S2B-026#81:1:A>
But what could make it really exciting is to get the designers too
and generate more ideas

<ICE-SIN:S2B-026#82:1:A>
But even if we could attract a top fashion master like Yves Saint
Laurent to Singapore there is still some apprehension

<ICE-SIN:S2B-026#83:1:A>
The local industry is experimenting with different approaches as
it's also looking for that very distinctive style

<ICE-SIN:S2B-026#84:1:A>
While it may takes some time to develop that distinctive Singapore
style the ground is being laid for fashioning a niche </I>

Caroline Ng lives with the fear that one day come an emergency
she'll have to receive donated blood from the blood bank

<ICE-SIN:S2B-026#86:2:B>
Caroline is just one of several people I've talked to who've raised
concerns about getting Aids from donated blood

<ICE-SIN:S2B-026#87:2:B>
And it appears these concerns have some basis

<ICE-SIN:S2B-026#88:2:B>
You see our blood bank does test all donated blood for diseases
including Aids and these tests are well-known to be very stringent

<ICE-SIN:S2B-026#89:2:B>
But the problem is these tests are not full-proof especially so
with Aids and that's because of this fact

<ICE-SIN:S2B-026#90:2:B>
For a period of between three to six months immediately after
you've caught the virus you won't be able to detect it no matter how well you
test for it

<ICE-SIN:S2B-026#91:2:B>
This is what doctors call the latent period or window period

<ICE-SIN:S2B-026#92:2:B>
The virus remains hidden and won't show up in any test

<ICE-SIN:S2B-026#93:2:B>
And according to doctor Koh Kwang Poh a G P who's been in practice
for twenty-eight years this is where the danger lies

<ICE-SIN:S2B-026#94:2:B>
So it would seem that the best way to make sure that donor blood
isn't infected with Aids is to keep it in the blood bank until after the
window period is over which is between three to six months and then test the
blood one more time

<ICE-SIN:S2B-026#95:2:B>
If the blood passes the second test then should it be used

<ICE-SIN:S2B-026#96:2:B>
But this isn't being done

<ICE-SIN:S2B-026#97:2:B>
I found out that our National Blood Bank only keeps blood for up to
forty-two days which isn't even two months

<ICE-SIN:S2B-026#98:2:B>
I asked the blood bank why they don't make an allowance for this
window period

<ICE-SIN:S2B-026#99:2:B>
They told me they can't keep the blood for so long because red
blood cells die after forty-two days

<ICE-SIN:S2B-026#100:2:B>
And warm blood can be frozen it's not practical to do so because
it takes too long to get it ready for use in an emergency

<ICE-SIN:S2B-026#101:2:B>
But if that's the case Caroline wants the right to choose another
option

<ICE-SIN:S2B-026#102:2:B>
What Caroline is talking about is a process called directed blood
donation an option provided overseas

<ICE-SIN:S2B-026#103:2:B>
And this option has its advantages

<ICE-SIN:S2B-026#104:2:B>
According to hematologist doctor Toh King Keat

<ICE-SIN:S2B-026#105:2:B>
However our National Blood Bank still stands by its policy

<ICE-SIN:S2B-026#106:2:B>
They will not provide directed donation simply because a patient
ask for it

<ICE-SIN:S2B-026#107:2:B>
According to them one reason is that blood transfusions between
close relative donors and patients raise the dangers of fatal graft versus
host disease

<ICE-SIN:S2B-026#108:2:B>
This disease occurs when you take blood from someone biologically
related to you like your siblings or parents

<ICE-SIN:S2B-026#109:2:B>
But studies show that chances of the disease occurring are less
than zero point one per cent

<ICE-SIN:S2B-026#110:2:B>
And it can be eliminated if the donated blood goes through a
process called irradiation

<ICE-SIN:S2B-026#111:2:B>
There's another reason why the blood bank won't change its policy
and that's administration problems

<ICE-SIN:S2B-026#112:2:B>
At the moment the blood bank handles ninety per cent of total
transfusions here and under the present system donor blood is stored in the
four main categories of rhesus positive and negative A B AB and O types

<ICE-SIN:S2B-026#113:2:B>
But with directed donation things will be more complicated

<ICE-SIN:S2B-026#114:2:B>
That's because every pint will be reserved for a specific patient
and so it's up to the blood bank to make sure that each pint goes to the
right patient

<ICE-SIN:S2B-026#115:2:B>
Naturally this would mean more administration problems and paper
work for the bank

<ICE-SIN:S2B-026#116:2:B>
But doctor Koh feels that shouldn't stop the blood bank </I>

<ICE-SIN:S2B-026#117:3:C>
Do you like shopping

<ICE-SIN:S2B-026#118:3:C>
Well I love it

<ICE-SIN:S2B-026#119:3:C>
And like a lot of other Singaporeans there's nothing that attracts
me more than a big sale

<ICE-SIN:S2B-026#120:3:C>
So it's no wonder that almost anywhere we turn we're bound to see
a sale sign

<ICE-SIN:S2B-026#121:3:C>
It doesn't matter if you're in a neighbourhood shop or in the
heart of Orchard road

<ICE-SIN:S2B-026#122:3:C>
Well here in the People's Park Complex I counted about forty shops
to having sales

<ICE-SIN:S2B-026#123:3:C>
That's about one-third of a total number of shops here

<ICE-SIN:S2B-026#124:3:C>
Well having a sale is one thing but whether you are really getting
a bargain is another

<ICE-SIN:S2B-026#125:3:C>
Here's a shop in the complex was holding its annual sale

<ICE-SIN:S2B-026#126:3:C>
And it claimed all items have been discounted by twenty up to
eighty per cent

<ICE-SIN:S2B-026#127:3:C>
Let's find out what the deal really is

<ICE-SIN:S2B-026#128:3:C>
Unfortunately halfway through my interview with the salesman our
camera ran into some technical problems

<ICE-SIN:S2B-026#129:3:C>
And while we're trying to fix the camera the salesman actually
tore the tag off and put a new tag on

<ICE-SIN:S2B-026#130:3:C>
One that said sixty-nine dollars

<ICE-SIN:S2B-026#131:3:C>
This is what happened when we continued the interview

<ICE-SIN:S2B-026#132:3:C>
Now I came to this came shop last week and the price then was
seventy-nine dollars

<ICE-SIN:S2B-026#133:3:C>
So if there was really a pricing error as the salesman claimed
then why wait until now to change the price

<ICE-SIN:S2B-026#134:3:C>
And anyway on this other pair outside the shop it still says
seventy-nine

<ICE-SIN:S2B-026#135:3:C>
I also checked the price of this same model in different shopping
centres and at most places they were selling it for about sixty-two dollars

<ICE-SIN:S2B-026#136:3:C>
But I found this shop in the Raffles City area which was selling
it for fifty-six and it wasn't even on sale <X>

<ICE-SIN:S2B-026#X137:3:C>
So even assuming that the first had made a pricing error its
supposed sale price is still what other shops charge normally And what was
worse this seems to be a very common practice among shopkeepers I checked
with a few more shops and one in Geylang was selling it cheaper and it wasn't
even on sale And it's not only small outlets that are guilty of holding so
called sale Even big department stores do it So it's clear some shops are
deliberately missing the word sale and consumers are being had Is there
anything we can do about it Albert Tan is with the Consumers' Association of
Singapore And that's the way it is in other countries In Germany and Belgium
for instance the law only allows shops to hold two sales a year the winter
sale and the summer sale And these are real sales because they have to
display old and new prices Oscar Kusi Belgium's Trade Commissioner to
Singapore explain how seriously the Belgium government takes this law Closer
to home even stores in Malaysia have to get a permit before they can reduce
their prices And there's a time limit imposed on the sale So would it help to
have a similar law here? The Consumers' Association of Singapore seems to
think so </X> </I>
