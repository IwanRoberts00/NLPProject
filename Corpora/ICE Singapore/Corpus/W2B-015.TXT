Any resemblance to actual persons, living or dead, is purely

setting and content of this book.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-015#5:1>
This is a true story.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-015#6:1>
A story of the drama of the human soul.

<h> PREFACE </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-015#11:1>
Illness is not only a medical " finding".

<ICE-SIN:W2B-015#12:1>
It is a feeling.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-015#13:1>
This is particularly so for the mortally ill.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-015#14:1>
There are few challenges in life that are more potent and stressful
than to live under the shadow of one's own immediate impending death.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-015#15:1>
The powerful hold that the mind has on the feelings of the body and
the workings of the human brain is felt most by those who are terminally ill;
or those labouring under the crippling weight of chronic, degenerative
painful diseases.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-015#16:1>
A person who decides against all odds to fight the crushing weight of
established knowledge and experiences is often a solitary figure and a
restless one.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-015#17:1>
If normal is defined as average that person is not an average.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-015#18:1>
Average is what you get out of average.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-015#19:1>
Yes, in a war where the odds of being blown to pieces seem to be
overwhelmingly stacked, those who are most likely to survive are those who
believe in the " impossible".

<ICE-SIN:W2B-015#20:1>
This story is told within the fabric of specific historical and
current settings.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-015#21:1>
For illness - like health - is a story.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-015#22:1>
A story of love that could kill the lover.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-015#23:1>
Of light ( knowledge) that could in brightness blind a person into
total darkness.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-015#24:1>
Of life, paradoxically impossible without love and light.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-015#25:1>
Above all, it is a story of how the hunted hunts for the silent
hunter killer within.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-015#26:1>
A very private story of almost limitless variations.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-015#27:1>
Health, like illness, is not only a technical medical problem for the
doctrinaire.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-015#28:1>
Although the approach of the author is anecdotal - the story itself
is written only after a period of considerable and intense research.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-015#29:1>
For the purpose of clarity, brevity, legality and order of
presentation, I have exercised limited literary liberty, control and
discretion in relation to the chronology of dialogues, monologues, the
presentation of the sequence of thoughts and feelings, the description of
events and the profiling of personalities without sacrifice of the essence.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-015#30:1>
This is because it is impossible to write a book of this nature 'word
for word and letter for letter' ( verbatim ac litteratim).

<ICE-SIN:W2B-015#31:1>
Underlying the interplay of characters and subtle influences is a
story of things that became right, at times in strange and unexpected ways,
when events went wrong.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-015#32:1>
The reader is free to share the hopes of the author and to accept or
challenge his interpretations.

<h> 1) CANCER: THE KILLER WITHIN </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-015#34:1>
Victim: Male age 41

<ICE-SIN:W2B-015#35:1>
Place: Singapore general Hospital ( SGH)

<ICE-SIN:W2B-015#36:1>
Department: Ear, Nose and Throat ( ENT)

<ICE-SIN:W2B-015#37:1>
Time: 3.00pm

<ICE-SIN:W2B-015#38:1>
Day: Wednesday

<ICE-SIN:W2B-015#39:1>
Date: October 14, 1981

<ICE-SIN:W2B-015#40:1>
Country: Republic of Singapore

<ICE-SIN:W2B-015#41:1>
( 1) Dressed in jacket and tie and an overall white slipover, Dr
Brian ( 2), the otolaryngologist ( Ear, Nose and Throat specialist), a
professional in his mid-thirties, settled down into his seat, bearing with
him all the dignity of his office.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-015#42:1>
In his hands were the X-Ray and medical reports, together with the
result of the biopsy ( 3) performed on my nasal cavities the day before.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-015#43:1>
Linda, my distraught wife sat beside me - visibly nervous.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-015#44:1>
Fidgeting with her handkerchief, she was clearly unable to brush
aside her anxieties.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-015#45:1>
Fear, pain and emotional agony were clearly visible in her pale and
frightened facial features.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-015#46:1>
I, on the other hand, tried to put up a bold iron front in order to
bolster her sagging confidence, knowing only too well her normal 'timid',
non-assertive disposition.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-015#47:1>
She had moreover been subjected to increasing palpitation of the
heart, during the past weeks, owing to the uncertainty as to what lay behind
my symptoms.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-015#48:1>
<h> THE VERDICT </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-015#49:1>
Dr Brian, the specialist, a soft-spoken, thoughtful and kindly
disposed gentleman, was clearly uncomfortable as he tried to play down the
gravity and deflect the impact of the report on my biopsy.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-015#50:1>
He began by digressing into small talk in order to avoid a direct
unhinging of the apocalyptic.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-015#51:1>
" Well, I'm surprised that the result of your biopsy was obtained so
soon - only a day after your operation".

<ICE-SIN:W2B-015#52:1>
The operation was on Monday, 12 October, 1981.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-015#53:1>
He added: " You know, I'm really surprised to find that you have so
many friends in this hospital".

<ICE-SIN:W2B-015#54:1>
I knew instinctively by then, that the doctor was playing for time.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-015#55:1>
The brutality of the truth had to be filtered out, if possible,
unobtrusively into our conversation.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-015#56:1>
He continued almost quietly: " There are many irregularities found in
your biopsy...".

<ICE-SIN:W2B-015#57:1>
" I know doctor," I interjected.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-015#58:1>
The tension was unbearable.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-015#59:1>
Firmly, I put forth the question: " Doctor, it's cancer is it not?"

<ICE-SIN:W2B-015#60:1>
He hesitated and in that split-second flash of a momentary pause, I
was actually hoping against all hopes that he would say " no".

<ICE-SIN:W2B-015#61:1>
His nod, although ever so slight was a positive one.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-015#62:1>
He replied almost inaudibly, " I am so sorry Lim, it is
naso-pharngeal carcinoma".(4) His words tore in like a sledge-hammer and
confirmed my worst and deadliest fear.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-015#63:1>
Though I had mentally rehearsed this possibility in my mind, when the
doctors decided to perform the emergency biopsy, I was still unable to ward
off the full impact of this fearsome disclosure.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-015#64:1>
It was unbelievable that so much fear could be invoked through so few
words.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-015#65:1>
Words ( diagnosis) that were based only on an excised fragment of
tissue placed under the microscope.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-015#66:1>
An extraordinarily powerful surge of emotion welled up within me.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-015#67:1>
I held myself strongly in check, conscious of how an outward show of
weakness on my part could adversely affect the nervous disposition of my
wife, Linda.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-015#68:1>
I took a quick side glance at her.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-015#69:1>
She was literally trembling, her face chalk white.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-015#70:1>
I sought to reassure her and myself by grasping at whatever ray of
hope that might be conceivable at that very moment.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-015#71:1>
" Could you operate on the 'irregularities' doctor?" I asked, my
voice choked with emotion.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-015#72:1>
By this question, I had hoped to avoid knowing the magnitude of the
reality that might be in store for me.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-015#73:1>
I desperately wanted to be told in front of my wife that this cancer
was a small, manageable and operable one.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-015#74:1>
The good doctor however, shook his head gently.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-015#75:1>
Softly, he emphasised: " The matter is out of my hands now.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-015#76:1>
There is nothing that I or Dr Ismet ( 5) from the Department of
Ophthalmology ( 6) can do for you at this moment".

<ICE-SIN:W2B-015#77:1>
I was examined earlier by Dr Ismet - a specialist from the
Ophthalmology Department.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-015#78:1>
" We have to refer you urgently to the Therapeutic Radiology
Department for immediate radiation".

<ICE-SIN:W2B-015#79:1>
My world crumpled.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-015#80:1>
Facts and brutal reality merged to overwhelm the construction of my
defence.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-015#81:1>
Natural defiance emerged.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-015#82:1>
Desperately, I sought to check the onslaught of emotions arising out
of the 'indignity' of this scourge.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-015#83:1>
Instinctively, I tried to cover up this primordial terror of being
abruptly slashed off at the prime of life.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-015#84:1>
Boldly as it were, I asserted to the doctor: " I do not want to be
subjected to the pain...the burn of constant radiation.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-015#85:1>
If I have to go, I go...Like a man!"

<ICE-SIN:W2B-015#86:1>
I harboured the haughty illusion that it was still " I" who was the
arbiter of my own time and fate.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-015#87:1>
" Don't be stubborn darling.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-015#88:1>
Can you just listen to the doctor for once?" Linda interjected.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-015#89:1>
" I want to have more time Linda, to consider the kind of treatment
that I have to go through.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-015#90:1>
This is cancer you know.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-015#91:1>
There is no known cure".

<ICE-SIN:W2B-015#92:1>
I replied, tensed with extreme mental and emotional uncertainty.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-015#93:1>
Speaking to my wife, I was actually addressing myself on all the
hidden thoughts, fears and unspoken prejudices that I had harboured on the
more 'modern' orthodox medical approaches to the treatment of cancer -
particularly radiation ( 7) and chemotherapy ( 8) - with their terrible
destruction of both cancerous and normal cells.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-015#94:1>
At the back of my mind, I thought that perhaps natural and or herbal
treatment could be an answer.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-015#95:1>
Or that there might at least be hope from the experience of others
who combat cancer through a combination of methods.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-015#96:1>
Methods that could include radiation, naturopathy ( 9),
homeopathy'(10), and biochemistry'(11).

<ICE-SIN:W2B-015#97:1>
" You don't have the time Lim," the ENT specialist warned.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-015#98:1>
" All the preparations have been made.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-015#99:1>
You must start treatment tomorrow".

<ICE-SIN:W2B-015#100:1>
" Doctor, what if I don't go for the radiation?" I asked in a last
but uncertain act of confused defiance.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-015#101:1>
Human mortality, until now only a question of third party interest
or merely a subject of intellectual acknowledgement, became all of a sudden
frightfully personal, agonizingly real and immutably immediate to me.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-015#102:1>
" Lim, any delay could affect your right eye as well.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-015#103:1>
We cannot then be responsible.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-015#104:1>
I suggest you go right now to see Dr Kim ( 2), Head of the
Department of Therapeutic Radiology for an appointment".

<ICE-SIN:W2B-015#105:1>
My left eye had gone completely squint with a cross to the right
just before the biopsy.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-015#106:1>
For two months before the operation, I had been waging a battle
against double vision, brought about by the erratic but progressive movement
of the left eyeball from the centre to the right.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-015#107:1>
The warning that my right eye would also be affected hit me with
cyclonic fury and left me breathless and dazed - like no other warning ever
could.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-015#108:1>
I found myself wordless, and frightfully desperate.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-015#109:1>
" You better go now.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-015#110:1>
But first don't forget to go for your registration and payment," the
doctor advised.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-015#111:1>
" Thank you very much, doctor, thank you," was all that I could
manage.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-015#112:1>
My wife gripped my left arm and led me out of the consultation room
into the corridor.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-015#113:1>
Her hands were ice-cold but her voice was clear and warmly
encouraging.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-015#114:1>
" You will be alright darling.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-015#115:1>
You'll be alright.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-015#116:1>
You must be brave".

<ICE-SIN:W2B-015#117:1>
I stared vacantly ahead, oblivious of the swirl of people, patients,
nurses and trolley-stretchers that flashed past me.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-015#118:1>
The word, " Cancer, cancer," repeatedly pounded and echoed and
re-echoed in the recesses of my mind.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-015#119:1>
All that I could say to my wife's attempted assurance was a whisper.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-015#120:1>
" Yes, Linda, yes Linda, darling!"

<ICE-SIN:W2B-015#121:1>
At this moment, the nurse of Dr Brian, the ENT specialist put her
head out of the door of the consultation room.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-015#122:1>
" There is a telephone call for you, Mr Lim." She called out loudly.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-015#123:1>
As we stepped back into the consultation room, the doctor handed me
the phone with a puzzled questioning look on his face and a furtive glance at
my wife, and said quietly: " A call for you, Lim".

<ICE-SIN:W2B-015#124:1>
" Lim, this is Maybelle," said the voice at the other end of the
line.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-015#125:1>
" I'm sorry, I wanted from the doctor the direct result of your
biopsy.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-015#126:1>
He told me to ask you personally.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-015#127:1>
Is Linda with you?".

<ICE-SIN:W2B-015#128:1>
" Yes", I answered.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-015#129:1>
The good doctor ever so considerate had been diplomatic in not
disclosing who had in fact called.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-015#130:1>
" How did you know I'm here?" I inquired, puzzled.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-015#131:1>
She replied in her usual assertive manner.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-015#132:1>
" Oh, an old lady in your house told me.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-015#133:1>
I couldn't understand her dialect, but she managed the word 'hospital'
in English.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-015#134:1>
I know the name of your specialist".

<ICE-SIN:W2B-015#135:1>
I told her that the biopsy was positive.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-015#136:1>
There was a long pause.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-015#137:1>
Then she broke down and sobbed over the phone.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-015#138:1>
" Say it's not true Lim.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-015#139:1>
Say it's not true!" She pleaded earnestly.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-015#140:1>
" But it is true.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-015#141:1>
It is true!" I said, my voice choked with emotion as I heard her
cry.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-015#142:1>
Linda asked who it was.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-015#143:1>
" Maybelle, Maybelle Lee." I replied.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-015#144:1>
Her call reminded me that I had to contact my office.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-015#145:1>
Secretary Ms Elaine Wong answered the call. <X>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-015#X146:1>
I informed her of the result of my biopsy and told her simply not
to await my return that evening.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-015#X147:1>
" Oh God! </X> </I>
