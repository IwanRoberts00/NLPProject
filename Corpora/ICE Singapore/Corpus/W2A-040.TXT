<h> 1 Introduction </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-040#7:1>
Hot isostatic pressing, commonly known as Hipping, can be regarded as
a thermomechanical technique employing, simultaneously, both elevated
temperature and isostatic pressure to process parts that are otherwise
difficult, if not impossible, to fabricate by conventional routes [ 1].

<ICE-SIN:W2A-040#8:1>
First invented in the mid-fifties for the diffusion-bonding of fuel
elements in the nuclear industry, the technique soon found many other areas
of application, such as in casting [ 2], powder metallurgy [ 3] and ceramics
[ 4].

<ICE-SIN:W2A-040#9:1>
Perhaps it is fair to add that the major obstacles to the wider
industrial application of HIP are the tremendously high capital and
operational costs.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-040#10:1>
Preparation of parts by encapsulation poses yet another problem in
terms of productivity and cost.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-040#11:1>
Some improvements and adaptation of the process and equipment have
been suggested and tried experimentally.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-040#12:1>
With ingenious innovation such as combining processes in a single
piece of equipment, it is expected that these obstacles to commercial
viability will slowly be removed.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-040#13:1>
Further, as equipment capabilities extent to higher operational
temperatures and pressures, more research into the Hipping of advanced
materials and composites is expected.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-040#14:1>
In particular, much research effort has been focused in the areas of
metal matrix composites [ 5,6], diffusion bonding [ 7] and Hipping as a
rejuvenation process for creep damage [ 8].

<ICE-SIN:W2A-040#15:1>
As compared to uniaxial hot pressing, HIP offers several advantages.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-040#16:1>
In the first instance, the isostatic nature of the pressure permits
processing of parts with geometrical complexities.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-040#17:1>
Further, the applied pressure may exceed that of the yield strengths
of metals at elevated temperatures, which renders the process more versatile.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-040#18:1>
Its chief advantage from the manufacturing perspective , however,
must surely lie in that HIP can fabricate parts to near-net-shape.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-040#19:1>
The use of advanced ceramics is very much felt in the aerospace,
chemical and electronic industries.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-040#20:1>
Their rigidity, chemical inertness and thermal stability render the
materials most suitable for high technologies.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-040#21:1>
Owing to their inherent brittleness, however, advanced ceramics are
typically joined to metals in engineering applications.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-040#22:1>
Such ceramic / metal bond couples can be found in electron tubes,
multi-layer substrates and capacitors, metal matrix composites, etc.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-040#23:1>
Whatever the service environment, be it physical, chemical,
mechanical load, thermal or electrical, the adhesion integrity of the ceramic
/ metal couple will be a basic technical pre-requisite.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-040#24:1>
<h> 2. Diffusion bonding </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-040#25:1>
I) Diffusion bonding is essentially a micro-deformation process which
joins two solid surfaces using applied load at elevated temperature in vacuum
or protective atmosphere.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-040#26:1>
The load applied must be sufficiently low to avoid macro deformation
of the parent materials, whilst the temperatures employed are usually 0.5-
0.8Tm, where Tm is the absolute melting temperature of the lesser refractory
material.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-040#27:1>
Processing time at temperature depends very much on the bond strength
required and on the materials involved.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-040#28:1>
Typically, this ranges from several hours at about 0.6Tm to only
minutes at 0.8Tm.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-040#29:1>
Cline [ 9] proposed a two-stage mechanism for the diffusion bonding
process.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-040#30:1>
Firstly, the applied load causes plastic deformation of surface
asperities, particularly on the softer of the two mating surfaces, which
reduces the interfacial voids.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-040#31:1>
Subsequently, the bond develops by diffusion controlled mechanisms
such as grain-boundary diffusion and power-law creep.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-040#32:1>
Today, there are many theoretical models designed to predict the
dominant mechanism at the various stages of diffusion bonding [ 10].

<ICE-SIN:W2A-040#33:1>
Hot isostatic pressing diagrams are also provided to relate the
respective mechanisms to the processing parameters [ 1].

<ICE-SIN:W2A-040#34:1>
Figure 1 shows, schematically, the sequential mechanism of diffusion
bonding between ceramic and metal as proposed by Derby [ 12].

<ICE-SIN:W2A-040#35:1>
To form an effective bond, the mating surfaces must come into close
atomic contact.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-040#36:1>
Hence, the original surface finishes must be good and free from
contaminants.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-040#37:1>
With the relatively higher HIP pressures of 100-200 MPa, however,
surface finishes become less critical and finishes of 0.8 um Ra have been
successfully HIP-bonded [ 13].

<ICE-SIN:W2A-040#38:1>
Systematic studies into the characteristics of ceramic/ metal
interfaces started in the early sixties.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-040#39:1>
Broadly speaking, interaction at a ceramic / metal interface can be
classified as physical and chemical.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-040#40:1>
The former involves understanding the thermodynamic and physical
aspects of a non-reactive non-oxide ceramic / metal interface, where no
charge or mass transfer can take place.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-040#41:1>
Chemical interaction, however, can occur between metal and ceramic by
a redox-dissolution reaction or a solution reaction in a reducing gas
atmosphere [ 14].

<ICE-SIN:W2A-040#42:1>
This creates an interfacial phase at the ceramic / metal junction
which differs structurally and physically from the parent materials.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-040#43:1>
Such a layer of reaction product can either enhance adhesivity or
lower the bond strength of the ceramic / metal couple.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-040#44:1>
This paper provides some laboratory results on the effects of HIP
parameters on the diffusion shear bond strength of nickel onto alumina.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-040#45:1>
The shear tests were simply carried out by the conventional method [
15] to evaluate the effects of treatment pressure, temperature and time.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-040#46:1>
The shear strength was calculated by dividing the maximum fracture
load by the area of the interface.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-040#47:1>
Owing to the configuration of the specimens and the differential CTEs
of the alumina-nickel couple ( which is likely to induce residual stresses
during the cooling phase of the HIP cycle), the values are therefore not to
be regarded as pure shear stresses.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-040#48:1>
<h> 3 Experimental procedure </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-040#49:1>
Pure and spherical nickel powder of sizes no larger than 45 um ( 325
mesh) were used in this project, their chemical composition being shown in
Table l.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-040#50:1>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-040#52:1>
These were encapsulated together with alumina tubing of 12 mm ID,
17.3 mm OD and 20 mm length.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-040#53:1>
The surfaces of the alumina tubing were cleansed ultrasonically
before encapsulation.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-040#54:1>
For encapsulation, mild steel cans of 34 mm diameter, 60 mm height
and 0.7 mm wall thickness were used.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-040#55:1>
Filled capsules were capped by TIG welding and evacuated at 300@C to
remove all traces of vapour and gases.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-040#56:1>
The evacuated capsules were then crimped and sealed at the evacuating
tube; the whole process being carried out using a 'Dr Capsule' work-station
as shown in Fig. 2.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-040#57:1>
Hipping was carried out using the 02-5X system as supplied by Kobe
Steel Pte.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-040#59:1>
( Fig.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-040#60:1>
3).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-040#61:1>
A molybdenum-element furnace was used and temperatures of 1150, 1200
and 1250C were employed for this study.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-040#62:1>
Pressures of 120, 160 and 200 MPa by pure argon were used with
treatment times varying from 64 to 256 min.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-040#63:1>
In all instances, the HIP cycles employed were of type 4 [ 1] which
increases temperature and pressure simultaneously.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-040#64:1>
After HIP, the capsules were de-canned by machining and cut into
three specimens using a diamond cutting machine.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-040#65:1>
Two specimens were used to determine the shear strength of the
nickel-alumina bond whilst the third specimen was used for microstructural
analysis.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-040#66:1>
X-ray diffractometry was employed also to analyse the compound formed
at the interface.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-040#67:1>
Figure 4 shows two Hipped specimens; the left one being de-canned in
preparation for shear tests.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-040#68:1>
The shear strength tests were carried out using a Shimndzu
Servopulser ED-20 tensile testing machine with a push-through fixture
designed and fabricated to ensure failure at the nickel-alumina interface.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-040#69:1>
<h> 4. Results and discussion </h  <>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-040#70:1>
<h> 4.1. Effect of pressure </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-040#71:1>
Isostatic pressures of 120, 160 and 200 MPa were employed to HIP the
specimens at 1200@C for 144 min.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-040#72:1>
Figure 5 shows the effect of these pressures on the shear bond
strength.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-040#73:1>
There was only marginal improvement when the pressure was increased
from 120 to 160 MPa.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-040#74:1>
At 200 MPa pressure, however, the shear bond strength was measured at
38.2 MPa, which is 2.3 times the bond strength of 16.6 MPa which was achieved
with the lower HIP pressures.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-040#75:1>
It can be envisaged that higher HIP pressure will bring about a
higher level of plastic micro-deformation at the ceramic/metal interface.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-040#76:1>
This implies a lower density of interfacial voids, thereby increasing
the contact areas between the two parent materials for chemical reaction and
inter-diffusion take place.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-040#77:1>
The effect of HIP pressure on the interphase layer was not
discernible latter measuring an average thicknesses of 4 um.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-040#78:1>
4.2.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-040#79:1>
Effect of temperature Specimens were Hipped at 1150, 1200 and 1250@C
for 100 min using 200 MPA pressure.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-040#80:1>
Figure 6 shows the effect of temperature on the interphase
thicknesses and the respective shear bond strength.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-040#81:1>
The interphase layer increased with increasing temperature.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-040#82:1>
For 1150@C, this measured only 1.4 um increasing to 6.0 um with the
1250@C treatment, which is in agreement with the Arrhenius equation of
reaction.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-040#83:1>
The shear bond strength, however, reached a maximum of 38.2 MPa with
the 1200@C treatment, the interphase layer measuring an average of 2.7 um.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-040#84:1>
Hence, it would appear that the optimum bond strength is a function
of the thickness of the interphase layer.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-040#85:1>
A thin interphase layer may signify incomplete or weak chemical bond
at the interface, thereby lowering the bond strength.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-040#86:1>
On other hand, a thick interphase layer of a complex compound may
embrittle the ceramic / metal junction.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-040#87:1>
<h> 4.3. Effect of time </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-040#88:1>
Hipping was carried out at 1200C, 200 MPa for 64, 100, 144 and 256
min.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-040#89:1>
Figure 7 shows the effect of HIP treatment time on the interphase
layer and shear bond strength.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-040#90:1>
With increasing treatment time, chemical reaction and diffusion were
allowed to continue at the ceramic/metal interface.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-040#91:1>
Hence, it is to be expected that the reaction layer will increase
with time.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-040#92:1>
The reaction rate time relationship, however, is yet to be
established as three phenomenon are at play simultaneously: the sintering of
nickel; the chemical reaction to form the interphase; and diffusion.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-040#93:1>
Of note, though, is the observation that the maximum shear bond
strength was achieved with the 100-minute treatment.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-040#94:1>
Here again, a drop in the shear bond strength is encountered with
interphase layers thinner or thicker than 2.7 um.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-040#95:1>
<h> 4.4. Nickel at aluminate spinel </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-040#96:1>
ln all instances of the shear tests, a product light blue in colour
observed to be adhered onto the alumina tubing.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-040#97:1>
This was identified by diffractometry as the nickel aluminate spinel,
NiAI204.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-040#98:1>
Figure 8 is NiO-Al2O phase diagram [ 16] which shows considerable
solubility of Al203 in Ni/1204.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-040#99:1>
In general, therefore, the nickel aluminate is represented as NiO (
l+x) Al203 with x varying from zero to a value, xn,, which defines a
Al203-saturated composition.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-040#100:1>
NiAI204 is the stoichiometric composition with x=0.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-040#101:1>
Elrefaie et al.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-040#102:1>
[ 16] produced an xmax value of 0.38 for the Al20, - saturated
composition at 1390'C.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-040#103:1>
Previous investigators had proposed that any spinel formation at the
Ni/AI203 interface must proceed through a NiO intermediate.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-040#104:1>
By experiment and thermodynamic calculation, however, Trumble et al.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-040#105:1>
[ ] 7] showed otherwise.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-040#106:1>
Nickel aluminate spinel formation at the Ni/Al203 interface requires
only that the threshold oxygen activity be exceeded.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-040#107:1>
Figure 9 shows their calculated threshold oxygen activity curve as a
function of temperature [ 17].

<ICE-SIN:W2A-040#108:1>
The sources of oxygen in this project were believed to be oxygen
initially dissolved in solution in the nickel powders and residual oxygen in
the capsule before HIP, the capsule being pumped down only to 10-2 torr.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-040#109:1>
Close examination of the sheared specimens showed that the nickel
aluminate was adhering to the Al203 tubing.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-040#110:1>
Hence, fracture paths had run along the spinel/nickel interface,
which implies that the spinel/nickel interfaces were weaker than the
spinel/Al2O3 interfaces.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-040#111:1>
The respective densities of nickel, spinel and Al203 in g/cm3 are
8.9, 4.3 and 4.0.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-040#112:1>
Thus, the volumetric change accompanying the reaction at the spinel
/ AI2O3 interface is comparatively smaller than that of the spinel/ Ni
interface, rendering the latter interface weaker in terms of bond strength.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-040#113:1>
Researchers have been divided in opinion as to the spinel effect on
the bond integrity of the nickel / AI20 interface.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-040#114:1>
Some like Bailey [ 18] claim that the spinel serves effectively to 'reaction
bond' the ceramic/metal interface.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-040#115:1>
Others, however, feel that the spinel has a severe weakening effect.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-040#116:1>
Trumble et al.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-040#117:1>
[ 17] suggested avoiding spinel formation to ensure a strong bond
between nickel and alumina.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-040#118:1>
Colin et al.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-040#119:1>
[ 7], on the other hand, noted that the shear bond strength of
Inconel-600/alumina interface was much weaker without spinel formation.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-040#120:1>
They achieved a maximum shear bond strength of 70 MPa with 100 MPa
of HIP pressure at 1300@C and 30 min of soaking time. <X>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-040#X121:1>
This study showed that a 2.7 um of interphase layer produced a
maximum shear bond strength of 38.2 MPa.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-040#X122:1>
A thinner layer, and by extrapolation no layer, would lower the
bond strength.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-040#X123:1>
Hence, it seems apparent that spinel formation is necessary to 'reaction
bond' the ceramic / metal junction.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-040#X124:1>
Where the reaction is excessive, however, it will lead to a drop of
the bond strength.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-040#X125:1>
It is believed that this is consequential of the thermal residual
stresses induced by virtue of the differential CTEs at the interphase/metal
junction during HTP cooling process.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-040#X126:1>
5.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-040#X127:1>
Conclusions All interfacial shear bond strength of 38.2 MPa was
achieved by hipping nickel powders onto alumina tubing at 1200@C, 200MPa and
100 min soaking time.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-040#X128:1>
This produced a reaction layer of the nickel aluminate spinel
measuring 2.7 m.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-040#X129:1>
In all instances, NiAI204 nickel aluminate spinel was observed at
Ni/AI203 interface, indicating that the oxygen level is higher than the
threshold oxygen activity level. </X> </I>
