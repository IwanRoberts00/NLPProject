<h> EGBERT </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#2:1>
Kwuan Loh

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#3:1>
I draw thick lines across the page.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#4:1>
Thick think lines.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#5:1>
Black on white.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#6:1>
The pen whines, blotting the coarse textured paper.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#7:1>
Think thing.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#8:1>
Man with pen, doodling.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#9:1>
No circles.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#10:1>
No squares.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#11:1>
Unformed forms.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#12:1>
Just lines running from one side of the wide white sheets to the
other side.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#13:1>
Wild white.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#14:1>
Then it comes, the pen moves of its own accord.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#15:1>
Driven by its own energy, the lines curve into characters.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#16:1>
Characters into choice words.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#17:1>
Choice words dripping from the ink of the pen.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#18:1>
Words about characters making choices.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#19:1>
Words forming thoughts forming patterns of thought.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#20:1>
The action of writing recreating actions.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#21:1>
Stroke upon stroke till the final period is in place.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#22:1>
Through the haze I think of Egbert.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#23:1>
Egbert is here once again.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#24:1>
The minute I saw it, I knew I wanted it.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#25:1>
It stood in the corner of the antique shop.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#26:1>
It hadn't been there before.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#27:1>
So I asked Mrs Lee, the antique shop owner who looked a little
antique herself.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#28:1>
She leaned forward confidentially, a broad beam on her lined face and
whispered.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#29:1>
" Isn't it beautiful?

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#30:1>
I got it from an old Peranakan family at a steal." Now this was
actually no real secret that had to be kept hush-hush.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#31:1>
It was merely Mrs Lee's way of ingratiating every customer, that he
was a valued customer because he was in her confidence.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#32:1>
I had dealt with her often enough to know this.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#33:1>
But the pieces I had brought were small pieces of porcelain,
reminiscent of past use and only of present decorative value.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#34:1>
It really was a beautiful cupboard.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#35:1>
Like all cupboards made during that time, it was deep rather than
tall.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#36:1>
The two doors did not quite meet now and were slightly tilted and
chipped.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#37:1>
But carved into the rich brown rosewood panelling was an intricate
pattern into which the traditional pattern of dragon and the phoenix were
interwoven.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#38:1>
Here and there were scratches and nicks and the odd watermarks where
careless hands had left water to seep into the old wood.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#39:1>
There was a curious burn mark on one side as if someone had lit a
candle inside.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#40:1>
I had to have it.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#41:1>
Mrs Lee named an exorbitant price.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#42:1>
After a little haggling, I decided that it would be my last
extravagant purchase for the year and oh, what the heck, I bought the
cupboard.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#43:1>
The arrangements for its delivery settled, Mrs Lee leaned forward
again.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#44:1>
" The cupboard has a very interesting history..."

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#45:1>
But before she could continue, the bell at the entrance tinkled and
she tottered off to give the new customer some service.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#46:1>
I went off, knowing full well that sometimes the interesting stories
behind these antiques were merely to justify the high prices on them.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#47:1>
When the cupboard arrived, it was installed proudly in the study.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#48:1>
It fitted right in with the other relics of my interest in that room.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#49:1>
It looked as if it had always been there.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#50:1>
The computer now looked out of place, but as it was the most
convenient thing on which to prepare lectures and organise one's life as a
university lecturer, the computer was a necessary evil.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#51:1>
The bright, almost fluorescent screen never seemed to bear easy on
the eyes.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#52:1>
My finger tips felt numb after hours of inputting ideas, ideas which
when reprinted on my laser printer look impersonal and cold.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#53:1>
Even letters typed on the computer carry a curt formality.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#54:1>
It did, how ever, look professional and often one concealed the
quality of one's work by its impressive professional appearance.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#55:1>
I would work putting in long hours at the green screen and then take
breaks, taking long looks at the cupboard.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#56:1>
Every time, I looked at it, I found pleasure in some particular
detail in the carving I had missed before.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#57:1>
Time and time again, my fascination with the cupboard was renewed.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#58:1>
The cupboard became a presence, a very real presence.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#59:1>
Then I became aware that things in the cupboard were rearranged from
time to time.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#60:1>
I was quite sure my mother never came into the study to pack my
things ( At 19, I had declared it out of bounds to all Mothers.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#61:1>
She generally thought of it as a disaster area and yet things in the
room found themselves in a kind of order.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#62:1>
The cupboard was especially packed neatly and, books strangely
stacked in alphabetic order according to author.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#63:1>
In more than little ways I found my life rearranged.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#64:1>
My field of study was the dry dustheap of recorded human existence,
History.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#65:1>
I was writing my doctoral dissertation on Straits Culture.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#66:1>
Sure, I like History.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#67:1>
I had got good marks for it throughout Secondary School because I was
able to retain facts fairly well.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#68:1>
I didn't particularly love it with the kind of devotion that the
other lecturers did, but my mother encouraged me to take it up to the level
of academia.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#69:1>
She wanted a doctor in the house and since none of us had entered the
Medicine faculty, this was the next best thing.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#70:1>
Anyway, from pages of reference books left open at odd places, I
found myself musing more often than not about the faces which looked out at
me from history.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#71:1>
Nameless faces from crowds.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#72:1>
Not the pioneers and rich philanthropic traders.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#73:1>
Anonymous persons frozen in formal poses in sepia print.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#74:1>
People caught unawares by cumbersome cameras trained on the crowds.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#75:1>
This awareness made my research take on a more human face.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#76:1>
I caught myself writing differently from what I was used to and had
to stop myself and attune myself to the fact that this was a doctoral thesis
and not an informal chronicle or a story book.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#77:1>
At that time, I was actually hardly really conscious of what was
going on.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#78:1>
It didn't really bother me.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#79:1>
Then I began to sense something or someone behind me while I was
working.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#80:1>
It wasn't uncomfortable or evil.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#81:1>
It was just there.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#82:1>
I ignored the feeling and put more effort into my work.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#83:1>
The deadlines for submissions were at approximately the same time as
when the student examination papers would arrive for grading.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#84:1>
I worked hard, harder as deadlines drew nearer.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#85:1>
Until one night, just before deadline, almost brain-dead from
exhaustion, I collapsed on the table and fell asleep.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#86:1>
When I woke, the first sound I heard was the sound of rustling paper.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#87:1>
Through the haze of half-sleep, I perceived that something was going
through my papers and clicking its teeth in some disapproval at what it was
reading.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#88:1>
I rubbed my eyes.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#89:1>
It didn't go away.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#90:1>
I can't really say I could see it, at least not clearly but I could
sense it and trace a hazy outline of what seemed to be a human form.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#91:1>
It turned and smiled in its own way.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#92:1>
Then it spoke.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#93:1>
" You wouldn't by any chance have a dictionary around, would you?"

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#94:1>
" No," I replied, slightly confused.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#95:1>
" I thought not.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#96:1>
I haven't seen one around."

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#97:1>
It said thoughtfully and then added, " So how do you know anything's
spelt right?"

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#98:1>
" There's a spelling check in the computer which I use to correct
spelling errors," I answered, still slightly confused.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#99:1>
" Computer?

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#100:1>
What's that?"

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#101:1>
I pointed at the computer in the corner.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#102:1>
" Oh, so that's what a computer looks like...

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#103:1>
Show me how it works please," It had asked politely and though I
felt a little foolish, I obliged and gave the thing a short computer
appreciation course.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#104:1>
All the time that I talked, it bent its head to one side, hand
propped under its chin listening intently and muttering " interesting...
interesting..."

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#105:1>
" And that's what a computer can do..." I rounded off the
presentation.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#106:1>
There was a brief silence and then it spoke again.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#107:1>
" It does so much...

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#108:1>
but it has...

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#109:1>
no character, no soul.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#110:1>
I don't like it.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#111:1>
Maybe...

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#112:1>
that's why you write...like this." It pointed to my thesis.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#113:1>
" Hey, that's a different thing altogether.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#114:1>
That's my thesis," The thing protested.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#115:1>
" It has no soul." I was beginning to get angry.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#116:1>
" Who or what do you think you are, anyway, to come barging in and
going through my things?

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#117:1>
Sticking your nose into other people's business!" For a moment, the
thing kept quiet.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#118:1>
Then, it stuck out a hand and said, " Call me Egbert.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#119:1>
I live in your cupboard."

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#120:1>
" Then, you really are a ghost!" Somehow the thought did not scare
me.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#121:1>
" Yes, I'm afraid so.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#122:1>
I've got to go now.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#123:1>
I've stayed out too long.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#124:1>
We'll talk again."

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#125:1>
It disappeared.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#126:1>
I knocked the side of my head and pinched myself hard.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#127:1>
Had I really been talking to a...

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#128:1>
ghost?

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#129:1>
Now if I had been dreaming, I would have been asleep.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#130:1>
If I had been asleep, I would have had to wake up.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#131:1>
But I didn't wake up.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#132:1>
Therefore I hadn't slept.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#133:1>
I hadn't dreamt it.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#134:1>
I spent the rest of the night until the morning, puzzling over what
had happened.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#135:1>
I couldn't explain it.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#136:1>
I didn't dare.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#137:1>
" Here, take this." A pen was thrust into my hand.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#138:1>
" Go ahead, write with it..." I removed the cap and drew a few
preliminary lines over the paper before me.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#139:1>
" Nice, isn't it?" Egbert said, with a kind of satisfied smile.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#140:1>
" That has got soul, and character." It did have character, the gold
tip was smooth and though the ink was old, it was an interesting shade of
blue.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#141:1>
It fitted into my hand comfortably.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#142:1>
I began to draw rough lines testing out the terrain of the tip.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#143:1>
It felt good.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#144:1>
" Nice pen," I said.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#145:1>
" It's mine," he said.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#146:1>
" Now it's yours."

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#147:1>
" Why?"

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#148:1>
" Consider it a gift."

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#149:1>
Then he disappeared, leaving behind more unanswered questions.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#150:1>
Then something strange happened.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#151:1>
Not that all this was not already strange enough.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#152:1>
It began with some phone calls.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#153:1>
" Hello, may I speak to Egbert Lim?" the caller had asked.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#154:1>
" I'm sorry.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#155:1>
There's no one by that name living here."

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#156:1>
" Is this 4442233?"

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#157:1>
" Yes, it is but there is no one called Egbert living here." "
Goodbye." My mother hung up and muttered " Pranksters." She saw me and
complained about a number of phone calls from various people who claimed to
be from magazine companies.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#158:1>
Someone was using our phone number as a prank.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#159:1>
They all spoke of one thing.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#160:1>
They wanted to contact someone called Egbert and pay him for his
stories.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#161:1>
I gasped.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#162:1>
" Er ...

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#163:1>
Mum, the next time one of them calls, call me okay?

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#164:1>
I'll take a message."

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#165:1>
" Then you know who this Egbert fellow is, hah?

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#166:1>
Tell him to get his own phone number.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#167:1>
I'm tired of taking messages for him.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#168:1>
What kind of friends do you have, son?

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#169:1>
Tell him to call Telecoms...

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#170:1>
Nowadays, very cheap and very quick..."

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#171:1>
Believe me, I tried.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#172:1>
But how was one to contact a ghost?

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#173:1>
I tried putting my head into the cupboard and speaking into it.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#174:1>
After a while, I felt silly and gave up.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#175:1>
Egbert was keeping a low profile.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#176:1>
I wasn't about to tell my mother about the spirit in the cupboard.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#177:1>
Neither could I tell the magazine people who Egbert was.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#178:1>
Who would believe me?

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#179:1>
Once in a while, when a script was rejected, it came back in the
standard brown envelope.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#180:1>
Unlike modern scripts, this was handwritten neatly with ink, blue
ink.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#181:1>
Interestingly, the scripts all had an unusual number of spelling
errors which riddled the impeccable grammar.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#182:1>
Egbert, my friendly ghost ( if you pardon the expression) could not
spell for the life of him.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#183:1>
I was hard put to keep explaining that Egbert was not available for
any one to talk to.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#184:1>
Mother began to suspect that I was really Egbert.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#185:1>
" Now, really, son, if you wanted to write under another name, you
could have chosen something else other than Egbert, couldn't you?

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#186:1>
What's wrong with the name your father and I gave you?" The
publishers began to address the cheque to me since I was Egbert's friend.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#187:1>
For ten months or so, Egbert did not put in an appearance.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#188:1>
Still, the stories were sent out somehow.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#189:1>
And the cheques came in regularly.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#190:1>
I put them into a bank and refused to touch the money. <X>

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#X191:1>
By this time, the work on my theses had ground to a standstill.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#X192:1>
I was thoroughly distracted by what was happening.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#X193:1>
I began to read the stories that Egbert had written.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-006#X194:1>
I must admit that with my meagre literary background that they were
well-written pieces. </X> </I>
