<h> The natural history of trophoblastic </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-030#3:1>
Contention over the classification of gestational troplloblastic
disease ( GTD) has now been resolved by all interested parties agreeing to
the definitions of the WHO Scientific Group on GTD ( 1983), simplified in
Table 1.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-030#4:1>
Complete hydatidiform mole is characterized by universally avascular,
hydropic villi which arc lined by hyperplastic syncytio-cytotrophoblast;
these are androgenetic in origin with two sets of paternal genome.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-030#5:1>
Almost 95% of moles are XX; 5% are XY, and rarely they may be
tetraploid.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-030#6:1>
Tetraploid cell lines may occur within diploid moles.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-030#7:1>
A partial hydatidiform mole is characterized by focal molar change,
the villi showing focal hyperplasia, scalloped outlines and vascularization
in various degrees of collapse.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-030#8:1>
The sac is usually empty. <X>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-030#10:1>
If present, the fetus show multiple anomalies characteristic of
triploidy because the partial mole is a triploid conceptus 3.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-030#11:1>
Choriocarcilloma is a malignant tumor of the trophoblast
characterized by complete absence of villi.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-030#12:1>
An invasive tumour showing villi formation is an invasive mole.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-030#13:1>
The placental site trophoblastic tumour ( PSTT) is a rare lesion
characterized by cytotrophoblast and a few syncytiotrophoblast which invade
the myometrium; a small number of cells stain for human chorionic
gonadotropin ( hCG) and circulating hCG is low; most cells stain for human
placental lactogen ( hPL).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-030#14:1>
PSTT may be preceded by pregnancy or hydatidiform mole.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-030#15:1>
<h> INCIDENCE </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-030#16:1>
The risk of molar pregnancy is highest after age 45 and in the teens,
and is rarest in pregnancies occurring between 25 and 39 years 6.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-030#17:1>
Hospital-based studies give the impression that gestational
trophoblastic disease is very common in Third World countries, but
population-based studies in Singapore and China demonstrated an incidence of
one in a thousand pregnancies - about twice the incidence in the West 7,8.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-030#18:1>
Delayed childbearing in any country may produce a change in incidence
if the agerelated frequency is consistent.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-030#19:1>
Unreliable data collection and differing approaches negate the value
of studying the trends in most countries.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-030#20:1>
Triploidy is fouud in 1-2%, of abortuses, and 80% of triploids are
said to beeome partial moles.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-030#21:1>
However, the discovered clinical incidence is much lower 2.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-030#22:1>
The risk of sequelae in hydatidiform mole is variously reported as
22%.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-030#23:1>
Our local experience during the 1960s showed that when a mole was
first diagnosed, 10% already showed evidence of invasive mole, i.e.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-030#24:1>
only 3-8% of 'benign' moles eventually develop residual trophoblastie
disease or choriocarcinoma 9.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-030#25:1>
Residual trophoblastic disease may be recognized by four features: a
regression curve pattern; any detectable hCG after 12 weeks; a rise or
plateau in hCG; and clinical and radiological evidence with hCG"'".

<ICE-SIN:W2A-030#26:1>
If B-hCG is negative ( less than 5miu/ml) at 8 weeks, the risk of
residual trophoblastie disease is 1:1000 or lower'2.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-030#27:1>
Current enzymeimmunoassay methods are now capable of detecting 20
miu/ml of hCG, and should be employed in those entrees that have no access to
radioimmunoassay techniques.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-030#28:1>
In women aged 40 and above, the risk of sequelae was fouud by S.H.Tow
to be 1: 3:3(13).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-030#29:1>
The events in the natural history of gestational trophoblastic
disease with their incidences are summarized in Figure 1.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-030#30:1>
<h> HYDATIDIFORM MOLE </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-030#31:1>
The commonest presentation of hydatidiform mole is irregular vaginal
bleeding following amenorrhoea and, in a full-blown mole, exaggeration of
pregnancy symptoms and signs.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-030#32:1>
In recent years, it has been more commonly picked up on early
pregnancy scans before any warning symptom or sign appears.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-030#33:1>
It is possible to make the diagnosis at 6-8 weeks, and ultrasound has
rendered all other diagnostic tests obsolete.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-030#34:1>
A hyperplastic placenta with an absent or grossly reduced amniotic
sac should make one suspect hydatidiform mole before the appearance of the
typical bubbly vesicles: a rescan a week later will clinch the diagnosis.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-030#35:1>
Anaemia and invasive disease need to be excluded before commencing
treatment.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-030#36:1>
The standard treatment is suction curettage.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-030#37:1>
We prefer to administer oxytoxics just prior to suction.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-030#38:1>
Between 15 and 20 % require a repeat curettage because of plateauing
hCG, bleeding or subinvolution, and 20% of such patients will eventually
require chelllotherapy 14.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-030#39:1>
Prophylactic chemotherapy is not advocated, but residual or invasive
mole must be diagnosed early and treated appropriately 6,l5.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-030#40:1>
A routine repeat dilatation and curettage is also not advocated 6.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-030#41:1>
Hysterectomy is seldom necessary in modern practice, but may be
considered in special circumstances if proper follow-up cannot be made.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-030#42:1>
Hysterectomy has a place in women over 40 years who have no plans for
further childbearing.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-030#43:1>
Patients with hydatidiform mole are reviewed weekly for 8 weeks,
monthly over the next 4 months, and twice a year thereafter.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-030#44:1>
During the initial stages, abnormal bleeding or amenorrhoea is
significant and clinical examination looks for subinvolution, ovarian cysts
and vaginal nodules.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-030#45:1>
Serum hCG is measured at each visit; the patient is given a chest
radiograph if indicated, and a pelvic ultrasonograph if amenorrhoeic.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-030#46:1>
The complications of invasive/ metastatic mole are: uterine
perforation, respiratory distress, cardiac failure, cerebral haemorrhage and
progression to choriocarcinoma 3.5.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-030#47:1>
Such complications occur more frequently if the uterus is larger than
expected at 24 weeks.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-030#48:1>
Our studies in the 1960s showed that when invasive moles were
aggressively treated, the risk of eventual choriocarcinoma was reduced from
5.85 to 1% 16.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-030#49:1>
Better results should be expected to today.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-030#50:1>
Single agent chemotherapy produces prompt remission in 95% of
invasive moles, and combination therapy, eg methotrexate, acthlonlycin-D and
chorambucil ( MAC) will produce remission in the remainder.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-030#51:1>
The key is always early diagnosis.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-030#52:1>
<h> PLACENTAL SITE TROPHOBLASTIC TUMOUR ( PSTT) </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-030#53:1>
PSTT is difficult to diagnose and there is insufficient experience
for categorical statements on appropriate therapy.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-030#54:1>
The diagnosis is histological, coupled with low serum hCG.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-030#55:1>
Immunocytocytochemistry and genetic fingerprinting distinguishes it
from other germ cell tumours.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-030#56:1>
The mitotic count generally correlates well with prognosis.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-030#57:1>
The mortality rate is around 15 %.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-030#58:1>
The lesion is relatively chemoresistant although some cases have
responded to EMA/CO.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-030#59:1>
Therefore hysterectomy is advocated 17.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-030#60:1>
A nephrotic syndrome has been described with the disease.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-030#61:1>
<h> PREGNANCIES AFTER HYDATIDIFORM MOLE </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-030#62:1>
There is a significant risk of recurrent hydatidiform mole variously
reported to range between 1:38 and 1: 125 ( 13,18).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-030#63:1>
There is no increased risk of complications if the pregnancy is
non-molar.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-030#64:1>
Among women who have received chemotheraphy, there is no significant
difference in the outcome of their subsequent pregnancies when compared to
the general population ( 19-21).

The role of surgery in the treatment of choriocarcinoma H Z Song.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-030#66:1>
<h> INTRODUCTION </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-030#67:1>
Since the development of effective chemotherapy, the role of surgery
in the treatment of choriocarcinoma has undergone a great change, evoking
much controversy among different authorities.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-030#68:1>
In China, a similar change has happened.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-030#69:1>
The present paper is an overview of the change of the role of surgery
in the treatment of choriocarcinoma for both primary tumour and metastatic
disease.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-030#70:1>
<h> ROLE OF SURGERY IN THE TREATMENT OF PRIMARY UTERINE DISEASE </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-030#71:1>
Before the availability of effective chemotherapy, hysterectomy
followed by postoperative irradiation was the only treatment for
choriocarcinoma and the therapeutic result was very poor.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-030#72:1>
Among a group of 41 patients treated at the Peking Union Medical
College Hospital, only four of six patients without apparent metastasis
survived.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-030#73:1>
After the advent of 6-mercaptopurine, surgery was then used in
combination with chemotherapy.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-030#74:1>
At the beginning, simple total or subtotal hysterectomy was employed.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-030#75:1>
Later, it was found that in a number of patients, clumps of actively
growing tumour cells or tumour emboli were found in the ovarian and
particularly the uterine veins, which often remained as a secondary source of
dissemination after the removal of the primary uterine disease.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-030#76:1>
The operative procedure was extended to include the ovarian veins up
to the Ievel of thc common iliac artery ( the most tortuous and engorged
portion) and thc uterine veins medial to the internal iliac vein ( the
usually thrombosed portion).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-030#77:1>
As the extended hysterectomy raised the complete remission rate from
39.1% to 50% and lowered the recurrence rate from 8.0% to 3.3%, this type of
operation was then used at one time as a routine procedure in our hospital (
1).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-030#78:1>
In order to reduce the risk of dissemination of tumour cells during
surgical manipulation, chemotherapy was given 2-3 days before operation and
continued postoperatively to complete a l0-day course.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-030#79:1>
The chemotherapy was repeated course by course till a complete
remission was achieved.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-030#80:1>
However, an extensive operation would inevitably form an additional
burden to patients receiving intensive cytotoxic chemotherapy.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-030#81:1>
Hence, following the successful trial of preservation of the
fertility of young patients treated by chemotherapy alone, without removal of
the uterus2, the role of surgery in our hospital was changed again.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-030#82:1>
Chemotherapy alone became the method of first choice for all
patients, including those who had already completed their families.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-030#83:1>
There was no significant increase in the number of courses of
chemotherapy required to achieve complete remission ( 4.9 courses with
hysterectomy vs 5.6 without).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-030#84:1>
The only disadvantage was that the lesions in the uterus might become
drug-resistant foci later on, if the chemotherapy was not properly given.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-030#85:1>
Howcver, this disadvantage was compensated by benefits.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-030#86:1>
The method of treatment was simplified and the risk of operation was
eliminated.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-030#87:1>
With the advent of more effective chemotherapeutic agents,
5-fluorouracil ( 5 FU) ( 28-30 mg kg-1 d-I dissolved in 500 ml 5% dextrose
given by slow intravcnous infusion for 8h over an 8-10-day course when used
singly) and KSM ( an antibiotic similar but not identical to dactomycin and
produced in China, 8-lO ug kg-1d-1 dissolved in 500ml 5% dextrose given by
intravenous infusion for 2-4h over an 8-10-day course when given singly),
thc overall survival rate for choriocarcinon1a was raised to more than 80% 3
and the rate of recurrence further reduced to 1.9%.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-030#88:1>
Moreover, it was found that if there was any recurrence in patients
without previous hysterectomy, the results of a further course of
chemotherapy were much better than in those patients with the uterus removed,
probably because the vascular system of thc uterus was kept intact so that
the chemotherapeutic agent could still be delivered to thc site of disease as
usual.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-030#89:1>
Hysterectomy is now performed in our hospital only under the
following conditions.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-030#90:1>
( 1) Acute perforation of the uterus with severe intra-abdominal
haemorrhage endangering the life of the patient.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-030#91:1>
In this condition, emergency surgery is life-saving.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-030#92:1>
Intrauterine haemorrhage, however, is usually not very severe and
responds to chemotherapy in a few days; it is not in itself an indication for
hysterectomy.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-030#93:1>
( 2) Persistent intramural lesion.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-030#94:1>
Most of the primary uterine disease can be eradicated by chemotherapy
alone, but at times the local lesion may become resistant to chemotherapeutic
agents, particularly if the initial treatment was not properly done.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-030#95:1>
Under this condition, hysterectomy is indicated.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-030#96:1>
In young patients who are still desirous of childbirth, local
excision of the uterine tumours may be worthwl1ile, if the focal lesions are
limited in size and number as evidenced by ultrasonography or arteriography.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-030#97:1>
Four of six patients so treated in our hospital had subsequent
successful pregnancies.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-030#98:1>
( 3) Atypical choriocarcinoma.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-030#99:1>
To clear up the diagnosis, hysterectomy is usually helpful,
particularly in patients with placental site choriocarcinoma.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-030#100:1>
In patients who request hysterectomy because of age or fear of
further pregnancy, hysterectomy may be performed but is better delayed until
after complete remission has been achieved.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-030#101:1>
In any condition, chemotherapy should also be given before, during
and after operation.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-030#102:1>
As delayed healing and rupture of the incisional wound has occurred
in several of our patients with severe anaemia, cachexia or chronic cough,
retention sutures are advisable for these patients.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-030#103:1>
<h> ROLE OF SURGERY IN THE TREATMENT OF METASTATIC LESIONS </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-030#104:1>
In our patients with metastatic choriocarcinoma, surgery was mainly
used in drug-resistant pulmonary metastases.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-030#105:1>
For metastases in other organs, surgery was done occasionally in
selected patients.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-030#106:1>
<h> Pulmonary metastases </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-030#107:1>
More than 90% of the patients with pulmonary metastases responded
well to chemotherapy.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-030#108:1>
However, in some patients, particularly those who were improperly
treated, resistance to chemotherapy developed after an initial response.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-030#109:1>
In these cases surgery, if properly selected, was helpful.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-030#110:1>
From 1965 to 1985, lung resection was performed in 50 patients with
residual foci of choriocarcinoma 4.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-030#111:1>
In summarizing the results, the survival rate was related to the
following conditions.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-030#112:1>
<h> Gynaecological cancer </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-030#113:1>
( 1)The pulmonary metastatic lesions were confined to one lobe were
well-circumscribed as seen on the chest films, either initially or after
chemotherapy, particularly when the lesion was solitary ( survival rate vs
10% in cases with multiple-lobe involvement after chemotherapy). <X>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-030#X114:1>
( 2) The titre of human chorionic gonadotropin ( hCG) by
radioimmunoassay after chemotherapy dropped down to a low (
< 2000mlU/ml) and then remained stationar y ( 80% survival when hCG
< 2000 mlU/ml vs 25% when hCG > 2000 mlU/ml).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-030#X115:1>
( 3) A change of the operative procedure to ligate the pulmonary
first to prevent dissemination during operation ( 69% vs 45% i vein was
ligated first).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-030#X116:1>
( 4) On pathological examination of the resected lung specimens
lesion or lesions were well-localized and surrounded by a lay fibrinous or
fibrotic material ( 91.3% vs.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-030#X117:1>
33.3% when not well-localized).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-030#X118:1>
( 5) After operation, the hCG titre returned to normal within 10 (
94% vs 0% if the titre rose rapidly).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-030#X119:1>
The clinical staging of the disease on admission seemed to have
bearing on the prognosis, provided that all the other metastases eradicated
by chemotherapy before operation. </X> </I>
