<h> INTRODUCTION:Singapore's Natural Heritage </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-027#4:1>
Along the equator, the sun beats down from its zenith with a maximum
intensity, that varies little between the peaks in March and September.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-027#5:1>
The length of day is also constant throughout the year.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-027#6:1>
Barely a degree and a half north of the equator, a mere nine minutes
separate the longest day year from the shortest.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-027#7:1>
In this equable region, the daily dose of solar radiation warms the
shallow waters of the China Sea to a uniform 28 degrees Celsius at its
surface.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-027#8:1>
Wind velocities are muted, even when the Southeast Asian monsoons
bring minor variations to the weather.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-027#9:1>
The moisture laden air from these monsoons delivers more than 2000 mm
of rain fairly evenly throughout the year.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-027#10:1>
Here in the doldrums, where climatic variations are greater from day
to night than from summer to winter, there lie some fifty islands which total
the 636 sq km of the Republic of Singapore.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-027#11:1>
Set like the point at the end of Peninsular Malaya's exclamation
mark, the 570 sq km Singapore Island and its offshore islands steep in the
warm waters, buffered from the seismic activity which rims the Asian-Pacific
region.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-027#12:1>
Millennia upon millennia of incubator-like calm enjoyed by the
archipelago has permitted a multitude of living organisms to adapt, evolve,
interact, reproduce and weave a web of life of such intricacy and complexity
over the hospitable substrate that it has defied full understanding and
documentation to the present day.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-027#13:1>
At the founding of Singapore in 1819, luxuriant lowland equatorial
rainforest clothed the gently undulating terrain of the islands.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-027#14:1>
It was a view that was to inspire the naturalist in the founder,
Stamford Raffles, and to elicit the comment three years later from Crawford,
Embassy from the Governor-General of India, " I do not believe there is any
part of the world which can afford a prospect in its way of superior
beauty....".

<ICE-SIN:W2B-027#15:1>
The land's intrinsic value and natural beauty did not stay the hand
of man from rending the web of life which mantled the islands.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-027#16:1>
The colonial imperative, and later, priorities of nation building,
dictated the wholesale reshaping of topography and clearing of forest to
provide space for the cultivation of crops.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-027#17:1>
The graceful contours of the land were flattened as hills were cut to
fill in swamps and valleys.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-027#18:1>
Coasts and bays were buried and smoothed.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-027#19:1>
Quarries were gouged into granite-bearing rock, and timbers were
extracted, all to meet the exigencies of a rapidly growing and thriving
community.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-027#20:1>
Singapore came to provide a classic example of man's impact upon his
environment, of a near total disruption of nature in all her aspects.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-027#21:1>
Thirty years after the founding of Singapore, more than half the
forest was still intact.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-027#22:1>
By 1854, however, the noted naturalist, Alfred Russell Wallace,
described the forest as having been reduced to isolated patches on tops of
hills.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-027#23:1>
The communities that were lost included those of the primary lowland
tropical evergreen forest, the freshwater swamp, the mangrove, and the beach.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-027#24:1>
Despite government ordinances and regulations set forth by the
establishment of the Forest Reserves in 1882, the political will to enforce
the laws for the protection of nature waxed and waned.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-027#25:1>
When stewardship of Singapore passed from colonial hands, the
inventory of nature reserves included Bukit Timah ( 75 ha), Pandan ( 219 ha),
Kranji ( 20 ha), Labrador ( 4 ha) and the central catchment area ( 1,622 ha).

<ICE-SIN:W2B-027#26:1>
The first 25 years of nationhood saw the remarkable transformation of
Singapore into a cosmopolitan city-state.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-027#27:1>
It is often said that this has been achieved without the benefit of
any natural resources.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-027#28:1>
It does not detract, however, from the obvious ability, dedication
and strength of character of Singapore's builders to append that its natural
resources have indeed contributed significantly to the nation's growth in the
past.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-027#29:1>
Increasingly, as Singapore strives for excellence as a global city of
the future, the people are awaking to the importance of caring for her
remaining natural resources.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-027#30:1>
The building of Singapore into a major centre of industry, commerce,
communications and tourism has transformed a colonial trading post into a
gleaming metropolis of concrete, glass and steel.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-027#31:1>
More than 80% of its population of three million own their homes in
high- rise apartments in satellite towns.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-027#32:1>
The creation of comfortable work environments has elicited high
productivity from a competent and dedicated work force.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-027#33:1>
This is a notable achievement in a part of the world that is hampered
with high Discomfort Indices in terms of temperature and relative humidity.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-027#34:1>
Within buildings, air conditioning has been the key.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-027#35:1>
For the external environment, a " clean and green" agenda was
established early in the development of the city.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-027#36:1>
The " garden city" programme saw to the planting of millions of trees
and shrubs along city streets and highways.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-027#37:1>
A system of parks and open spaces was developed to offer relief from
an increasingly concretised environment.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-027#38:1>
Refinement of the programme has brought more colour, fragrance and
variety to the planted areas.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-027#39:1>
Over the years, an aggressive plant introduction programme has
amassed a rich array of cultivated species and hybrids on Singapore soil.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-027#40:1>
Reminiscent of the immigrant races who have made their way to our
shores, many of these introduced plants thrived and became naturalised in the
salubrious environment.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-027#41:1>
The Garden City image of Singapore owes much to the presence of these
elements from foreign shores.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-027#42:1>
With growing affluence, the needs and aspirations of a better
educated and more widely travelled population are not easily satisfied.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-027#43:1>
Well-tended parks where natural succession is kept at bay at great
expense of manpower and funds no longer suffice to fulfill aesthetic and
spiritual needs.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-027#44:1>
It is a world-wide phenomenon, this gradual impingement upon public
consciousness that man's presence in the biological history of the earth is
but a mote in the rich tapestry of evolved life forms.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-027#45:1>
As Singapore has become an important international communication hub,
her people are no longer insulated from sharing this experience.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-027#46:1>
This " green" awareness stimulated a growing appreciation for nature
and the call of the wild.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-027#47:1>
It is bringing home the realisation that Singapore still possesses a
rich heritage of native flora and fauna which requires nurture.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-027#48:1>
The confluence of this new-found awareness, the yearning to retain
cultural and historical roots, and the capability to do something about it,
culminated in the formation of a statutory body whose time had come.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-027#49:1>
The National Parks Board came into existence on 6 June 1990 with the
responsibility to develop, manage and promote the national parks and nature
reserves of Singapore as valuable resources for recreation, research,
education and conservation.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-027#50:1>
Designated as National Parks are Fort Canning Park, the Singapore
Botanic Gardens and over 2000 hectares of Nature Reserves in the centre of
Singapore Island.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-027#53:1>
When Raffles sailed into the mouth of the Singapore River, a hill 45
m above the low-lying plain was the dominating feature that greeted him.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-027#54:1>
This was the " Forbidden Hill", Bukit Larangan, seat of the rulers of
ancient Temasek.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-027#55:1>
The crumbling fortifications emanating from the hill had once
repelled Siamese invaders from the north.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-027#56:1>
A spring on the slope facing the river fed the bathing pool of the
royal family.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-027#57:1>
The tombs of 14th - century nobility kept the hill sacrosanct.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-027#58:1>
Recognising the obvious advantages of the strategic site, the
colonial founder established his residence on the hill.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-027#59:1>
Raffles not only had his house built there but also set about
planning the first botanic garden of Singapore on the hill.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-027#60:1>
A 48-acre plot incorporating a portion of the eastern slopes of the
hill was set aside for this purpose.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-027#61:1>
Raffles expended much effort and personal expense in establishing the
garden.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-027#62:1>
Essentially a plantation of economic crops on trial, this garden
carried the British hopes of breaking the Dutch monopoly on the lucrative
spice trade in the East.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-027#63:1>
To the coconuts, bananas, betel nuts and vegetables of the early
Malay settlers and the gambier and pepper cultivation of the first Chinese
settlers, Raffles added nutmeg and cloves.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-027#64:1>
This was followed by the introduction of other cash crops like
cinnamon, coffee, cocoa, cotton, gamboge, indigo, vanilla and sugarcane.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-027#65:1>
Pests and diseases, with which the native species had achieved a
truce, made unprofitable the plantation cropping of most of these new
introductions.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-027#66:1>
Pepper and gamier proved successful.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-027#67:1>
Their tandem cultivation was however, to have disastrous consequences
for the forest of Singapore in the 19th century.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-027#68:1>
The residence of Stamford Raffles conferred upon the hill the name "
Government Hill".

<ICE-SIN:W2B-027#69:1>
In 1859, the hill's strategic attributes caused it to be turned into
an artillery fort complete with barracks, a hospital, magazines, ramparts,
trenches, 68-pounder cannons and other fortifications.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-027#70:1>
It was named Fort Canning in honour of Viscount George Canning,
Governor General and First Viceroy of India.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-027#71:1>
Perhaps coincidentally, a Colonel Canning supervised the construction
of the Fort.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-027#72:1>
In 1907, the artillery moved from Fort Canning Hill, and the Fort
became the headquarters of the Far East Command.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-027#73:1>
The military role of the hill continued until the 1 970's, first as a
military base occupied by the British, then by the Japanese during World War
II, and lastly by the Republic's armed forces.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-027#74:1>
Departure of the military presence left an oasis of green in the
centre of a brick, concrete, steel and glass jungle that has risen around the
base of the hill.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-027#75:1>
A covered reservoir occupies the summit, and next to it lies buried
an extensive bunker complex, silent testimony to the futile efforts of
British Far East Command.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-027#76:1>
Telecommunication installations have gracelessly usurped the site of
the former residence of Raffles.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-027#77:1>
Some of the relics on the hill from the 14th and 19th centuries are
being incorporated in a re-development programme by the National Parks Board
to rejuvenate Fort Canning Park as Singapore's " Hill of History".

<ICE-SIN:W2B-027#78:1>
One of the two remaining military buildings, Fort Canning Centre, has
already been restored for cultural use, replacing the tramp of soldiers'
boots with the soft pads of dancers' feet.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-027#79:1>
The other building, the old Singapore Common Staff College, awaits
its turn for adaptive re-use in the plans to revitalise the hill.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-027#80:1>
The verdant growth of plants, native, introduced or escaped, is
gradually softening the rude touch of man on the hill.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-027#81:1>
A trace of the botanic garden, abandoned in 1829 through lack of
proper administration and government support, is seen in several ancient
coconut palm which line a steep walkway leading to a splendidly restored
keramat.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-027#82:1>
A kapu tree ( Ceiba pentandra) sheds cotton puffs on a lawn which was
formerly the first Christian cemetery in Singapore.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-027#83:1>
Tropical fig species ( Ficussp.) are in full evidence in many forms
on Fort Canning.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-027#84:1>
They cover the Fort ramparts with a network of roots and smother host
trees to eventually become free-standing components of the canopy.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-027#85:1>
They creep up trunks of large trees to display their luscious fruit
to tempt potential seed delivery agents and crawl over ground, rock and wall
with such an affinity as to form a green skin over bare forms.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-027#86:1>
Magnificent raintrees ( Samanea saman) with wide-spreading crowns,
introduced from their native South America in 1876, have become vital
naturalised components of our greenscape.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-027#87:1>
A whole community of epiphytes and arboreal fauna regards their
branches as home.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-027#88:1>
Giant-leaved relatives of the breadfruit ( Artocarpus sp) rise tall
into the canopy, strewing the ground with leather-brown leaves like discarded
platters.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-027#89:1>
Madras thorn trees ( Pithecellobium dulce), banished from the city
streets because of their untidy habits, grow to majestic size on the steep
slopes of the hill.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-027#90:1>
Other fine-leaved legumes like the saga ( Adenanthera pavonina),
albizia ( Albizia falcataria), tamarind ( Tamarindus indicsu) and yellow
flame ( Peltophorum pterocarpum) blend their lace-like foliage with their
coarser-leaved cousins, the jiring ( Pithecellobium jiringa) and purple
milletia ( Milletia atropurpurea) to form a green screen which shields
vistors from concrete towers that have sprung up at the foot of the hill.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-027#91:1>
Breaks in the canopy afford historic views of the city that can still
be glimpsed from the once prominent hill.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-027#92:1>
The urban forest on the hill has grown to serve as a sanctuary for
the wild-life that eke out an existence in close proximity to man. <X>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-027#X93:1>
The flash of yellow of the black-naped oriole ( Oriolus chinensis) ,
the explosive blue of the collared kingfisher ( Halcyon chloris) and the
muted tones of the pink-necked pigeon ( Treron vernans) bring life and colour
to the hill. </X> </I>
