Dear Brenda,

<ICE-SIN:W1B-028#26:2>
<h> Universities Endowment Fund </h>

<ICE-SIN:W1B-028#27:2>
You will remember my knocking on your door, or waylaying you in the
corridor, or interposing myself between the mailbox and you some two months
ago, as the Department's representative to the Arts Faculty Fund Raising
Committee for the Universities Endowment Fund, and cheerful courier for the
Vice-Chancellor's letter to you of 27 January 1992.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-028#28:2>
More recently, you may have been one of those I reminded about the
Fund, either along the corridor or in the Department's kitchen.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-028#29:2>
Instead of working my way down the corridors of authority once again,
this time with the prospect of making myself the most tolerated colleague, I
thought I'd write a follow-up note to ask if you have responded to the
Vice-Chancellor's letter.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-028#30:2>
If you have already done so, please ignore this.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-028#31:2>
The targeted size of the Fund, and the average contribution I gave as
a statistical figure (
&dollar;50/ staff member per month over five years, i.e.,
&dollar;3,000 ) do not necessarily require a corresponding or proportionate
contribution from you over a matching period of time.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-028#32:2>
As donations go, it is the spirit which counts, and the support
rather than the actual monetary amount, which is being sought.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-028#33:2>
Again, it is not compulsory for you to contribute, but it would be
most encouraging - for the Department and for the Fund - if you could
graciously give your support.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-028#34:2>
Thank you.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-028#35:2>
Sincerely,

<ICE-SIN:W1B-028#36:2>

Dear customer

<ICE-SIN:W1B-028#56:3>

<ICE-SIN:W1B-028#57:3>
Today, I'm delighted to send you your own Clinique card.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-028#58:3>
This card identifies you as a regular customer of Clinique.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-028#59:3>
And with it, we can serve you better.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-028#60:3>
Let me explain how.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-028#61:3>
The back of your card will have your name, skin type/ strength and
the Clinique store you've registered with.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-028#62:3>
Now you don't face the inconvenience of filling the Transaction Data
Card whenever you make a purchase.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-028#63:3>
Just show the card to your favourite Clinique consultant who will
update your purchases.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-028#64:3>
From your card, the Clinique Consultant knows your skin type and
strength right away.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-028#65:3>
And as the inside of your card shows your past purchases, it enables
the Clinique Consultants to focus on your needs and provide you with better
service.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-028#66:3>
It's important that you show this card each time you visit your
favourite Clinique counter.

This will allow the Clinique Consultants to meet your needs quickly,
efficiently.

Dear Mrs Lee

<ICE-SIN:W1B-028#97:5>
Vice-Chancellor's Office

<ICE-SIN:W1B-028#98:5>
As you are aware our University and Nanyang Technological University
have jointly embarked on a campaign to raise a Universities Endowment Fund of
&dollar;1 billion in five years.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-028#99:5>
The Chancellor, Mr Wee Kim Wee, President of Singapore, is our
Patron-in-Chief.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-028#100:5>
Mr Lien Ying Chow, Chairman of University Council, and Mr Wee Cho
Yaw, a member of the Council, are two of the four patrons.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-028#101:5>
The purpose of this Fund which is a capital fund is to generate
income to support special and innovative projects which will help our
Universities attain international renown as centres of academic excellence.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-028#102:5>
It will enable them to develop programmes which nurture intellectual
curiosity and research and thus enhance their contributions to the growth and
development of our nation.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-028#103:5>
More specifically the funds will be used in our University for the
following: Development and introduction of new academic disciplines including
securing services of specialist and expert staff.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-028#104:5>
Development of new postgraduate programmes.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-028#105:5>
Enhancement of basic and applied research in disciplines relevant to
the needs of Singapore.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-028#106:5>
Development of new research centres.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-028#107:5>
To signify its strong support for higher education Government has
very generously donated
&dollar;500 million to the Fund and has in addition pledged to match dollar for
dollar all contributions up to
&dollar;250 million.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-028#108:5>
As the Fund is of direct benefit to us in the University, I feel
sure you will want to make a donation.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-028#109:5>
I would ask you to make a donation commensurate with the importance
and size of the Fund and also commensurate with your ability to give.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-028#110:5>
You may wish to make an outright donation or request the Bursar to
deduct whatever sum you wish monthly for a set period of months up to the
next five years.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-028#111:5>
Whatever you give will be gratefully received.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-028#112:5>
All donations are exempted from income tax.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-028#113:5>
A Staff Donation Form is enclosed for your use.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-028#114:5>
Please designate which University you wish your donation to go to.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-028#115:5>
This procedure is necessary in order to secure dollar-for-dollar
matching from Government.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-028#116:5>
Donations not designated will be shared equally between the two
Universities.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-028#117:5>
I am glad to inform you that a colleague in your department will
deliver this letter personally to you.
