We are sorry that the talk by BG ( Res) Lee Hsien Loong set for
November 1992 had to be postponed for reasons now obvious to us.

Dear Sir

<ICE-SIN:W1B-023#112:5>
<h> YOUR GUIDE TO LIFE INSURANCE </h>

<ICE-SIN:W1B-023#113:5>
The Life Insurance Association ( LIA) is pleased to present to you a
complimentary copy of our latest publication, Your Guide to Life Insurance.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-023#114:5>
The life insurance product is intangible, basically a promise to pay
some time in the future.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-023#115:5>
Furthermore, it is technically complex and highly legalistic.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-023#116:5>
Therefore, we believe that a consumer guide, such as this, simply
written for the layman, would be most welcome to the general public .

<ICE-SIN:W1B-023#117:5>
We hope that this short guide will be freely circulated amongst
friends and colleagues to promote a better understanding of life insurance.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-023#118:5>
A Chinese edition of this guide is also available.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-023#119:5>
If you wish to know more about the subject and the LIA, please feel
free to get in touch with the Executive Secretary.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-023#120:5>
Yours faithfully.

Re: Invitation to Singapore Informatics ' 94.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-023#131:6>
We, Panesian Singapore Pte Ltd, serve as the liaison office for MAG
monitors in South East Asia, South Asia and Middle East.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-023#132:6>
We carry both flat screen tube and trinitron tube ( by Sony) for all
screen sizes.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-023#133:6>
All our monitors are green with power saving features, which would
help you save cost in the long run.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-023#134:6>
MAG monitors are also gentle on the user's eyes.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-023#135:6>
Extremely low magnetic and electric radiation level of all MAG
monitors enable MAG to conform to the stringent MPR II and the newest Swedish
TCO 1992 radiation standard.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-023#136:6>
MAG has won numerous awards worldwide and has been " Editors'
Choice" in world renounced magazines such as PC World and PC Magazine.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-023#137:6>
Another interesting feature is MAG monitors' compatibility to both
Apple Macintosh and PC, which is useful for both users.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-023#138:6>
We would be displaying MAG monitors with models ranging from 14" to
21" at the Singapore Informatics ' 94 ( 13th - 16th October).

<ICE-SIN:W1B-023#139:6>
We would be pleased to know your opinion and feedback on our
products.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-023#161:7> 3. The origins of these places, the history behind the names of
their streets and prominent landmarks/buildings which stand in their
precincts, will be highlighted in the exhibition.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-023#162:7> 4. This is a rare opportunity for members of the public,
Singaporeans and tourists alike, to view archival photographs of old
Singapore and see how far we have come since then.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-023#179:8> Dear Sir,

<ICE-SIN:W1B-023#180:8> Recently, I had a tiff with my elderly friend over the usage Of the
words " fightings and urgings".

<ICE-SIN:W1B-023#181:8> My friend who is proficient and competent in the English Language
adamantly disagree saying that such words are inappropriate English and
grammatically incorrect.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-023#182:8> 2. However I pointed out to him that I had on several occasions
stumbled across such words over our local newspaper and bulletins.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-023#183:8> Still, he denied saying that " newspapers can be wrong".

<ICE-SIN:W1B-023#184:8> I then quoted a recent Straits Times report where the word was used.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-023#185:8> " President Marcos last night speaking over a private network, owned
by one of his close associates, has frequested urgings from the White House
and the Filipino people to stop asking him to step down as President".

<ICE-SIN:W1B-023#186:8> 3. Finally, being a respected and competent institution on the
English Language in Singapore we humbly seek clarification from you on its
legality and acceptability of such words in modern English.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-023#187:8> This would certainly help to diffuse our confusions and at the same
time, enhance our knowledge.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-023#188:8> 4. Many thanks to you and anxiously awaiting your reply.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-023#189:8> Yours faithfully
