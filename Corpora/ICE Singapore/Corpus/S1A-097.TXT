<ICE-SIN:S1A-097#19:1:B>

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-097#20:1:A>
Oh uhm actually she's I think like secretarial or
administrative support to

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-097#21:1:B>
To

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-097#22:1:A>
Her boss lah

<ICE-SIN:S1A-097#23:1:A>
Ya

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-097#24:1:B>
What what's what what is it doing

<ICE-SIN:S1A-097#25:1:B>
Are they a research group or what

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-097#26:1:A>
Uhm oh Andersen Consulting does uh these you see they have
clients

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-097#27:1:B>
Uhm uhm

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-097#28:1:A>
and the clients ask them to do computer packages for them or

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-097#29:1:B>
Uhm

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-097#30:1:A>
training sessions and stuff like that

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-097#31:1:B>
Uhm uhm uhm uhm

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-097#32:1:A>
So they have to present proposals and all lah

<ICE-SIN:S1A-097#33:1:A>
So he will I think provides uhm support lah

<ICE-SIN:S1A-097#34:1:A>
Administrative support

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-097#35:1:B>
Uhm uhm uhm

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-097#36:1:A>
Ya like uh maybe when they need certain things then she like
when they need you know information on stuff like this she'll come down and
get it

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-097#37:1:B>
Oh so fun

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-097#38:1:A>
So ya so the main actually the main bulk of the work is done
by con the consultants

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-097#39:1:B>
Oh

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-097#40:1:A>
<unclear> word </unclear> consultants they pay them quite a
lot so I I hope will will get to be one lah

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-097#41:1:B>
Ya I hope I hope

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-097#42:1:A>
Ya so actually ya so she said see how lah

<ICE-SIN:S1A-097#43:1:A>
So consultants are the ones who actually do up the proposal you see

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-097#44:1:B>
Uhm

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-097#45:1:A>
and you know get the information and write up the stuff

<ICE-SIN:S1A-097#46:1:A>
So I think for her she just you know provides support lah

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-097#47:1:B>
So she does the running about and gathering the information
lah

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-097#48:1:A>
Uhm I don't know about the running about

<ICE-SIN:S1A-097#49:1:A>
This is the first time I've heard her coming here to get
information ya

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-097#50:1:B>
Ah

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-097#51:1:A>
I think probably the consultants have to do it themselves

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-097#52:1:B>
Uh eh so fun uh

<ICE-SIN:S1A-097#53:1:B>
I hope one day she become a consultant

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-097#54:1:A>
Ya I hope so too

<ICE-SIN:S1A-097#55:1:A>
Anyway ya it sounds pretty interesting

<ICE-SIN:S1A-097#56:1:A>
Why don't you go into that too

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-097#57:1:B>
Ya I can do research

<ICE-SIN:S1A-097#58:1:B>
But then how

<ICE-SIN:S1A-097#59:1:B>
Uh maybe they want things like accounting and and management

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-097#60:1:A>
No I don't think so

<ICE-SIN:S1A-097#61:1:A>
They take in they they take in BA people as well

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-097#62:1:B>
How Lang Lang Lang also

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-097#63:1:A>
Ya I think so ya

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-097#64:1:B>
Eh then maybe I can ask her

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-097#65:1:A>
Ya ya ask

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-097#66:1:B>
If there's vacancy

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-097#67:1:A>
and you know just write in your resume and then or or

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-097#68:1:B>
If there's vacancy suh

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-097#69:1:A>
<unclear> word </unclear> itself

<ICE-SIN:S1A-097#70:1:A>
Ya and then ask them lor

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-097#71:1:B>
Uhm uhm uhm

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-097#72:1:A>
I think should be quite fun uh

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-097#73:1:B>
Ya should should be quite fun

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-097#74:1:A>
and they pay quite well

<ICE-SIN:S1A-097#75:1:A>
So and that's only for an ordinary degree

<ICE-SIN:S1A-097#76:1:A>
So if you've got a masters I think that will be worth something

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-097#77:1:B>
Ya maybe maybe I could

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-097#78:1:A>

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-097#79:1:B>

<ICE-SIN:S1A-097#100:1:A>
Anyway we met Marianne so that's okay

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-097#101:1:B>

Ya I wanted to ask you also about your your sister whether

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-097#103:1:B>
Ya

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-097#104:1:A>
we spoke with her after she met Jokim and how she feels and
stuff like that

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-097#105:1:B>
Ya ya ya

<ICE-SIN:S1A-097#106:1:B>
So so okay she called me lah

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-097#107:1:A>
Ah

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-097#108:1:B>
and then she just like okay she she she she likes Jokim
because she can talk to Jokim and everything lah

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-097#109:1:A>
Uhm

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-097#110:1:B>
Then I said like so how's how how do how do you like the
hairstyling you know

<ICE-SIN:S1A-097#111:1:B>
Very good

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-097#112:1:A>
Uhm

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-097#113:1:B>
She's very impressed but then I think like make-up she was
like I don't know what she was looking for lah but actually like I mean what
do you expect

<ICE-SIN:S1A-097#114:1:B>
Like miracles uh

<ICE-SIN:S1A-097#115:1:B>
I mean what do you expect

<ICE-SIN:S1A-097#116:1:B>
Like like those tsk you know those artists uh those Paris make-up
artists uh

<ICE-SIN:S1A-097#117:1:B>
Like super-models uh

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-097#118:1:A>
Ya those models uh ya

<ICE-SIN:S1A-097#119:1:A>
Ya I well I don't think the the photos do a lot of justice to the
make-up lah but

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-097#120:1:B>
Uhm

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-097#121:1:A>
I think it's also very important to remember who who the
models are you see I mean because they are like normal you know

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-097#122:1:B>
Ordinary people

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-097#123:1:A>
Ya ordinary people

<ICE-SIN:S1A-097#124:1:A>
You see so it's not like I mean not exactly like your Ah Lian Ah
Hui that sort lah but you know

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-097#125:1:B>
Ya but

<ICE-SIN:S1A-097#126:1:B>
Ya

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-097#127:1:A>
Ya so and sometimes you can't expect miracles really

<ICE-SIN:S1A-097#128:1:A>
I mean of course you want to look good you know but uhm ya and
then some of these people may not be photogenic

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-097#129:1:B>
Ya that's right

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-097#130:1:A>
You know so it doesn't come off

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-097#131:1:B>
And you you don't have all those touch-ups and photography

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-097#132:1:A>
Ya

<ICE-SIN:S1A-097#133:1:A>
Ah tell your sis if she wants uh

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-097#134:1:B>
Ya

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-097#135:1:A>
she can come over to my place

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-097#136:1:B>
Uhm

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-097#137:1:A>
and have a look at my Dayspring album

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-097#138:1:B>
Ya ya ya okay

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-097#139:1:A>
Ah because uh then you know to see if she wants before if she
wants uh that sort of photographs before she signs up lah otherwise

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-097#140:1:B>
Uhm uhm uhm

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-097#141:1:A>
you know if it's not to her expectation then you know seven
hundred and ninety dollars is a lot of money to spend for that

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-097#142:1:B>
Ya

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-097#143:1:A>
Then she can also see the make-up

<ICE-SIN:S1A-097#144:1:A>
I I really like Dayspring's uhm make-up artist did really

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-097#145:1:B>

<ICE-SIN:S1A-097#157:1:A>

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-097#159:1:B>
Ya ya

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-097#160:1:A>
So uhm ya if she wants to you can ask her lah <unclear> word

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-097#161:1:B>

your photographs

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-097#162:1:A>
Ya I mean in the studio photo I take uh

<ICE-SIN:S1A-097#163:1:A>

<ICE-SIN:S1A-097#164:1:B>
Yes yes yes yes

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-097#167:1:B>
Ya enhanced lah enhanced lah

<$A>

Ya but Hans oh oh enhanced

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-097#170:1:B>
Enhanced

<ICE-SIN:S1A-097#171:1:B>
Hans like ya Hans

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-097#172:1:A>
Like goldfish eyes

<ICE-SIN:S1A-097#173:1:A>
He can't get over it

<ICE-SIN:S1A-097#174:1:A>
So like so sad because he's really the photogenic one you know

<ICE-SIN:S1A-097#175:1:A>
I'm the one who's not

<ICE-SIN:S1A-097#176:1:A>
So I say oh you got no problem lah you know

<ICE-SIN:S1A-097#177:1:A>
So when the photos turned out it's like why am I like staring like
that

<ICE-SIN:S1A-097#178:1:A>
So I've to find excuses you know

<ICE-SIN:S1A-097#179:1:A>
No lah maybe sleepy that day no maybe headache lah

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-097#180:1:B>
Maybe he should have looked into a flower <unclear> word
</unclear> looking

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-097#181:1:A>
Ya he's <unclear> word </unclear> disappointed but I mean I
still think he looks good

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-097#182:1:B>
Ya

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-097#183:1:A>
Because he's really very photogenic

<ICE-SIN:S1A-097#184:1:A>
When you take him un unawares uh

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-097#185:1:B>
Ya

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-097#186:1:A>
He comes out very nicely

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-097#187:1:B>
Uhm uhm

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-097#188:1:A>
for some reason or other

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-097#189:1:B>
Ya

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-097#190:1:A>
That's why I told you lah when I pin up his hair

<ICE-SIN:S1A-097#191:1:A>
Quite good

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-097#192:1:B>
Some some people it it's it's like this you know whether the
camera likes you or not

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-097#193:1:A>
ya

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-097#194:1:B>
Ya

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-097#195:1:A>
Some it's like turns out really good and also I think it
depends on the photographer's skill and the kind of background

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-097#196:1:B>
Uhm

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-097#197:1:A>
Like uhm there was once I I wore this red dress

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-097#198:1:B>
Uhm uhm uhm uhm

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-097#199:1:A>
to go to this friend's wedding so she took photographer like

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-097#200:1:B>
Uhm

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-097#201:1:A>
I looked normal lah you know goggy

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-097#202:1:B>
Uhm

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-097#203:1:A>
And all that When I went to take then the same day that
afternoon

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-097#204:1:B>
Uhm uhm

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-097#205:1:A>
I went to take uhm a passport photograph and uhm my IC photo
<unclear> word </unclear>

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-097#206:1:B>
Ya ya oh ya you're telling me

<ICE-SIN:S1A-097#207:1:B>
Very nice

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-097#208:1:A>
Ya then like ya quite good

<ICE-SIN:S1A-097#209:1:A>
So I thought ya I suppose it depends on who's taking it as well as

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-097#210:1:B>
Ya

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-097#211:1:A>
The kind of uhm background that you have then

<ICE-SIN:S1A-097#212:1:A>
Ya lah a lot of factors

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-097#213:1:B>
Ya

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-097#214:1:A>
whether it's outside indoors or outdoors so all that Burn
