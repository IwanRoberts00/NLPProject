<ICE-SIN:S1A-011#X1:1> 31 March 1992

<ICE-SIN:S1A-011#X2:1> Cecilia after a while you will you will ask question
like okay understand </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-011#3:1:A>
Ya

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-011#4:1:B>
And after a while all your vocab is down the drain

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-011#5:1:C>
Actually it's quite true you know

<ICE-SIN:S1A-011#6:1:C>
Because uh like when I was teaching uh sometimes when when you have
to speak their level sometimes you may have to even speak bro broken English
you know

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-011#7:1:B>
Ya

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-011#8:1:C>
In order that they understand you know

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-011#9:1:B>
Ya ya

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-011#10:1:C>
Not for your own sake but for their sake you may have to

<$ICE-SIN:S1A-011#> So if for I mean if you do that for long alright you fear 
that maybe
your standard of English will deteriorate also

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-011#11:1:B>
Definitely

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-011#12:1:C>
Most most probably Ya

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-011#13:1:B>
So you all better watch out

<ICE-SIN:S1A-011#14:1:B>
One of these day I'll be speaking in broken English

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-011#15:1:C>
You don't say you know 'A' not me you all don't know

<ICE-SIN:S1A-011#16:1:C>
Even for me uh I work in the library cos I have to conduct course
visits right

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-011#17:1:B>
Ah

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-011#18:1:C>
For the for students

<ICE-SIN:S1A-011#19:1:C>
I mean when they come uh and some of them lah they're from very bad
schools I mean from the quite lousy schools okay

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-011#20:1:B>
Uhm uhm

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-011#21:1:C>
and so when I talk to them

<ICE-SIN:S1A-011#22:1:C>
And I if I want to make myself understood let's say to the lower
primaries at primary two primary four and they're from <unclear> word
</unclear> courses uh I've to

<ICE-SIN:S1A-011#23:1:C>
I've I've to do that too

<ICE-SIN:S1A-011#24:1:C>
I always quite embarrassing because there's a teacher who's sitting
behind and then they say Huh even the librarian also speak like that nuh

<ICE-SIN:S1A-011#25:1:C>
But I may have to do it because like one teacher told me

<ICE-SIN:S1A-011#26:1:C>
You know wah you speak so good English to them they won't
understand you you know

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-011#27:1:B>
It's true

<ICE-SIN:S1A-011#28:1:B>
It's strange

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-011#29:1:C>
Ya that's what they told me

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-011#30:1:B>
But you have no such trouble like mine

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-011#31:1:C>
So

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-011#32:1:A>
Uhm not really

<ICE-SIN:S1A-011#33:1:A>
I don't think I have usually

<ICE-SIN:S1A-011#34:1:A>
Uh I have to speak business English with the bankers

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-011#35:1:C>

problem lah

<ICE-SIN:S1A-011#39:1:A>
Because

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-011#40:1:B>
Ya

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-011#41:1:C>
I mean if you're if you're talking to bankers

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-011#42:1:A>
In fact the bankers that I I dealt with uh most of them are
overseas graduates so they slang a bit when I talk to them

<ICE-SIN:S1A-011#43:1:A>
Can can tell lah

<ICE-SIN:S1A-011#44:1:A>
This slang

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-011#45:1:B>
I hated people who slang

<ICE-SIN:S1A-011#46:1:B>
Wah I can't stand it and I can't understand

<ICE-SIN:S1A-011#47:1:B>
That's the worst part

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-011#67:1:C>
I mean

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-011#68:1:B>
It's probably second or third first

<ICE-SIN:S1A-011#69:1:B>
It's either first second or third of June that we'll be going that
means we'll be departing uh

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-011#70:1:C>
Uhm

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-011#71:1:B>
Uhm three days the offer is three days

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-011#72:1:C>

<ICE-SIN:S1A-011#73:1:B>
Uhm actually it was only three nine nine but because June is
the peak season

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-011#74:1:C>
Ya

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-011#75:1:B>
So they add another eighty dollars surcharge so it's about
four seven nine

<ICE-SIN:S1A-011#76:1:B>
Four seven nine uh correct or not

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-011#77:1:C>

<ICE-SIN:S1A-011#83:1:B>
High season they call it

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-011#84:1:C>

expensive

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-011#85:1:B>
Four seven nine

<ICE-SIN:S1A-011#86:1:B>
The only thing we find it attractive is that additional night is
only thirty dollars and it's four-star hotel

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-011#87:1:C>

<ICE-SIN:S1A-011#119:1:B>
Uhm uhm

<ICE-SIN:S1A-011#120:1:B>

have a very nice five four-day holiday

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-011#121:1:C>
You tell me <unclear> word </unclear> Ha <O> in Cantonese </O>

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-011#122:1:A>
Sufficient or not

<ICE-SIN:S1A-011#123:1:A>
Five hundred

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-011#124:1:C>
Put aside five hundred dollars

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-011#125:1:B>
Five hundred

<ICE-SIN:S1A-011#126:1:B>
You see this is four seven nine

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-011#127:1:A>
But you go there you have to buy things what

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-011#128:1:B>
okay plus

<ICE-SIN:S1A-011#129:1:B>
Uh that's provided you don't buy things lor

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-011#130:1:C>
Wait wait wait

<ICE-SIN:S1A-011#131:1:C>
You said it's four seven nine for three days uh

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-011#132:1:B>
Ah four seven nine then plus twelve dollars airport tax

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-011#133:1:A>

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-011#134:1:B>
Ya

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-011#135:1:C>
But then the food leh

<ICE-SIN:S1A-011#136:1:C>
Do they cover all meals <unclear> word </unclear>

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-011#137:1:B>
They they covered all meals except the fourth uh the third
first second nuh third day

<ICE-SIN:S1A-011#138:1:B>
Third day only breakfast so you settle your own dinner and nuh
lunch

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-011#139:1:C>
So two days that means covered except third day dinner and
lunch

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-011#140:1:B>
Then <unclear> word </unclear>

<ICE-SIN:S1A-011#141:1:B>
Ah then the fourth day I suppose they give you the breakfast
before you fly off

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-011#142:1:C>
Wait wait wait wait

<ICE-SIN:S1A-011#143:1:C>
Oh that means it's actually a four-day tour lah

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-011#144:1:B>
If you want nuh

<ICE-SIN:S1A-011#145:1:B>
I'm assuming you go for four days

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-011#146:1:C>
so the fourth

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-011#147:1:B>
because three days is like too short

<ICE-SIN:S1A-011#148:1:B>
You see uh first day and second day there'll be tours guided tours

<ICE-SIN:S1A-011#149:1:B>
You know that means they'll take you

<ICE-SIN:S1A-011#150:1:B>

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-011#151:1:C>

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-011#152:1:B>
and then third day and you go off

<ICE-SIN:S1A-011#153:1:B>

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-011#154:1:C>

<ICE-SIN:S1A-011#161:1:B>

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-011#162:1:C>
That's why

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-011#163:1:B>
Five zero nine

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-011#164:1:C>

<ICE-SIN:S1A-011#221:1:B>
But I don't know

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-011#222:1:A>
You know Phuket is not a cheap place lah

<ICE-SIN:S1A-011#223:1:A>
Phuket itself is not a cheap place to get

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-011#224:1:C>
Huh

<ICE-SIN:S1A-011#225:1:C>
It's not a cheap place

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-011#226:1:A>
Ya

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-011#227:1:B>
Cheapest place is Bangkok

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-011#228:1:C>
You know last time uh when it was not so commercialised and
then you know not so developed as a tourist spot yet I mean it was quite
cheap

<ICE-SIN:S1A-011#229:1:C>
But I think now because of uh uh uh avalanche of western tourists
then you know they <unclear> word </unclear> together I think now more
expensive

<ICE-SIN:S1A-011#230:1:C>
But somebody told me it's not cheap uh

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-011#231:1:B>
Ya I heard it's because they have to import the goods right
from Bangkok itself

<ICE-SIN:S1A-011#232:1:B>
I mean they are selling

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-011#233:1:A>
They are selling imported goods is it

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-011#234:1:C>
So actually Bangkok is cheaper lah

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-011#235:1:A>
Ya

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-011#236:1:B>
Bangkok itself is very cheap
