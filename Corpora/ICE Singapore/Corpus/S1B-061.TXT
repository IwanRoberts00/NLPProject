<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#1:2:A>
Doctor Balaji could you please give his Honour your
qualifications

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#2:2:B>
My qualifications

<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#3:2:B>
I'm a M B B S Singapore

<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#4:2:B>
A fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons Glasgow

<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#5:2:B>
Completed a neurosurgical residency in the United States at Henry
Ford Hospital

<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#6:2:B>
And a board eligible neurosurgeon

<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#7:2:B>
I have a Paediatric Neurosurgical Fellowship from Harvard
University

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#8:2:A>
A what the last bit

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#9:2:B>
A Paediatric Neurosurgical Fellowship from Harvard

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#10:2:A>
Doctor Balaji when did you first qualify with the M B B S
degree

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#11:2:B>
Nineteen seventy nine

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#12:2:A>
And from when have you been involved in neuro surgery

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#13:2:B>
From nineteen eighty two

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#14:2:A>
And when did you become consultant neurosurgeon

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#15:2:B>
January this year

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#16:2:A>
In nineteen eighty four were you attached to the neuro surgery
department at Tan Tock Seng Hospital

<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#17:2:A>
Particularly in September October November nineteen eighty four

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#18:2:B>
Yes I believe so

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#19:2:A>
By that time would it be fair to say that you would have been
holding the position of Registrar in that department if you got acquainted
with neuro surgery eighty two

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#20:2:B>
I was trainee in neuro surgery at that time

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#21:2:A>
Doctor Balaji did you come across the first Plaintiff Jeya
wife of Akkaiah whilst she was admitted to the neurosurgical unit of the Tan
Tock Seng Hospital on eighteenth October nineteen eighty four

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#22:2:B>
I do not recollect looking after this patient at that time

<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#23:2:B>
and looking at the record I do not see my involvement in her
management at any time at that time

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#24:2:A>
So the only occasion on which you saw the first Plaintiff was
on the twentieth of August nineteen ninety for the purpose of making this
report at page nineteen of the bundle

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#25:2:B>
Yes

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#26:2:A>
How long did you see the first Plaintiff during this
consultation at the out patient dispensary

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#27:2:B>
Forty five minutes about

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#28:2:A>
Doctor Balaji I may have to ask you a few questions from the
records

<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#29:2:A>
Can you please confirm to the Court that you have all the records
from the hospital in relation to the first Plaintiff

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#30:2:B>
The records are with Doctor Lai outside

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#31:2:A>
Could we have the records

<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#32:2:A>
I'm sorry your Honour but I would like to have a

<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#33:2:A>
Do you have them

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#34:2:B>
Yes

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#35:2:A>
Now before we go to the records could you please kindly look
at

<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#36:2:A>
Do you have a bundle

<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#37:2:A>
Plaintiff's bundle

<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#38:2:A>
Could you please turn to page nine

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#39:2:B>
Is that Mister Baratham's report

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#40:2:A>
Yes twenty fourth of September nineteen eighty five

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#41:2:B>
Yes I have it in front of me

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#42:2:A>
You have that

<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#43:2:A>
At the time when you were in the Department of Neuro surgery Doctor
Baratham was the senior neurosurgeon and head of the department

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#44:2:B>
Yes that is true

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#45:2:A>
Now Doctor Baratham in this particular report states Doctor
Balaji she sustained a head injury with a skull fracture

<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#46:2:A>
and on x ray was found to have air inside her head

<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#47:2:A>
This implied the possibility of infection and she was given
prolonged course of antibiotics

<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#48:2:A>
No definite effects result from her head injury but she was treated
by the orthopaedic surgeon for various orthopaedic injuries

<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#49:2:A>
Please make reference to orthopaedic report

<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#50:2:A>
Now what would be your comment about the statement that there were
no definite effects resulting from her head injury

<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#51:2:A>
You have now Doctor Balaji you have now seen the records of this
patient

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#52:2:B>
Yes I would say I do not agree with that

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#53:2:A>
You do not agree with that

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#54:2:B>
Yes for the following reasons if I may be allowed to give the
reasons

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#55:2:A>
Yes with that statement no definite effects result from her
head injury

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#56:2:B>
Yes for the following reasons

<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#57:2:B>
One first with regard to the question of infection

<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#58:2:B>
Looking through the records you find that patient febrile for many
days and

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#59:2:C>
Sorry, patient

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#60:2:B>
Yes when she was admitted in nineteen

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#61:2:C>
Yes I didn't catch you what you said

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#62:2:B>
The patient had fever for many days while the patient was in
hospital

<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#63:2:B>
And when there is air in the head and the patient has a fever it
must be assumed that most likely cause of the fever is an infection of the
brain

<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#64:2:B>
I also have the benefit of Doctor Ong's report and testing

<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#65:2:B>
He just went by one of the functions of the frontal lobe which
would be intellect which we can measure objectively using I Q test

<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#66:2:B>
The patient's I Q test has dropped to below normal

<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#67:2:B>
A normal I Q being between eighty to one hundred and twenty range

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#68:2:A>
And what was the reading of the I Q in the record

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#69:2:B>
I refer to page eighteen the second line

<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#70:2:B>
The psychological assessment done showed her to be functioning at
borderline range of intelligence I Q sixty eight to seventy five

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#71:2:A>
No Doctor Balaji I think you are jumping the sequence

<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#72:2:A>
We are still in eighty five

<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#73:2:A>
This report at page eighteen is made in nineteen eighty seven

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#74:2:B>
Yes

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#75:2:A>
So levels of intelligence do change you must agree

<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#76:2:A>
So let's stick to ninety eighty five

<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#77:2:A>
Doctor Baratham's report and you said that you did not agree with
that statement for a variety of reasons and you were giving those reasons

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#78:2:B>
You see I disagreed with Doctor Baratham's statement in
nineteen ninety

<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#79:2:B>
In nineteen eighty five when Doctor Baratham was making his report
I have no input into this matter

<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#80:2:B>
So my decision or my statement or disagreement with him is based on
information that is available to me in nineteen ninety

<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#81:2:B>
Whether I would have disagreed with him in nineteen eighty five
when he wrote the report I don't know

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#82:2:A>
Doctor Balaji in nineteen eighty five

<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#83:2:A>
If you had examined the first Plaintiff would you have made the
same statement as Doctor Baratham has made in his report

<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#84:2:A>
No definite effects result from her head injury

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#85:2:B>
I don't know I would have to see the patient in order to give
an opinion

<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#86:2:B>
and not having seen the patient it's hard to say whether I would
have given the same opinion or not

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#87:2:A>
Doctor Balaji

<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#88:2:A>
Doctor Baratham clarified just now that at the time when he made
his report on the twenty fourth of September nineteen eighty five he had not
had the occasion to have a consultation with the patient

<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#89:2:A>
But he made the report based on the hospital records

<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#90:2:A>
I'm asking you that if you were in his shoes in nineteen eighty
five no consultation with the first Plaintiff purely based on the records

<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#91:2:A>
Would you have made that statement

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#92:2:B>
No

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#93:2:A>
Why not

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#94:2:B>
Because the patient stayed in hospital for a prolonged period
of time

<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#95:2:B>
Patient was in hospital for at least a month

<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#96:2:B>
There was air in the head which meant there was a fracture of the
front part of the skull

<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#97:2:B>
The patient had fever for many days and all this would have
suggested to me a serious injury to the brain

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#98:2:A>
Doctor Balaji what do you understand by that statement that
Doctor Baratham made

<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#99:2:A>
no definite effects result from her head injury

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#100:2:B>
I would understand it to mean that he thought he could not be
sure that the head injury caused all her problems

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#101:2:A>
Can I ask you by reference to your records hospital records

<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#102:2:A>
Can you please tell his Honour what were the complaints and
condition of the first Plaintiff at that time

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#103:2:B>
During the time of admission

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#104:2:A>
No we're talking about September eighty five

<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#105:2:A>
Well I'll take you through Doctor Balaji

<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#106:2:A>
The patient was the first Plaintiff was admitted on the eighteenth
of April nineteen eight four

<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#107:2:A>
She stayed in hospital for one month during that time that she
stayed in hospital what were her persistent or common complaints

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#108:2:B>
When she came in she was confused she was not obeying any
instructions

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#109:2:C>
This was at the time of the accident or

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#110:2:B>
At the time first day of admission

<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#111:2:B>
Two days after her admission her condition was still thought to be
very poor

<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#112:2:B>
About ten days after admission we have the first note that states
that she is now conscious

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#113:2:A>
Let his Honour record want you are saying

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#114:2:B>
But the report doesn't state what level of mental activity
there was

<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#115:2:B>
But that's the first note of her being conscious

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#116:2:A>
So ten days after the admission she's conscious

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#117:2:B>
Yes

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#118:2:A>
Right

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#119:2:B>
And then it's about two months or rather one and a half
months after admission

<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#120:2:B>
You have the first note which states that she is now sounding a
little rational

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#121:2:A>
Irrational

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#122:2:B>
No

<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#123:2:B>
Sounding rational first

<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#124:2:B>
Note that she is not only conscious but she's now rational

<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#125:2:B>
At least in the eyes of the doctor the medical officer who wrote
that

<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#126:2:B>
So the main complaint appears to have been fever and her mental
functions

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#127:2:A>
Please look at the report carefully

<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#128:2:A>
Are there any other complaints or condition that she suffered
during that time from the date of admission to the time she was normal

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#129:2:B>
Yes she has got thigh ulcers

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#130:2:A>
No I'm talking about from the neurological point of view

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#131:2:B>
From the neuro logic point of view

<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#132:2:B>
No nothing else in the record

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#133:2:A>
No

<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#134:2:A>
Is there any reference to poor memory

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#135:2:B>
No

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#136:2:A>
Is there any reference to incontinence

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#137:2:B>
No

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#138:2:A>
Is there any reference to her inability to control her bowel

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#139:2:B>
No

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#140:2:A>
Is there any reference to emotionally being emotionally
labile

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#141:2:B>
No

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#142:2:A>
Doctor Balaji you said that only after ten days the record
shows that she was in a conscious state

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#143:2:B>
Yes

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#144:2:A>
Right

<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#145:2:A>
Could you please look at page six of that bundle before you

<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#146:2:A>
The Plaintiff's bundle of documents which were given to you

<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#147:2:A>
Your Honour page six of the P B

<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#148:2:A>
You have that

<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#149:2:A>
That's a report from Doctor Ong Tze Guan

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#150:2:B>
Yes

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#151:2:A>
Now in the first paragraph at the second sentence he says the
above-named was admitted to the Neuro logical Unit on seventeenth October
eighty four following a road traffic accident

<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#152:2:A>
She was conscious but confused

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#153:2:B>
Yes

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#154:2:A>
So does your record show that she was admitted in a conscious
state or was she admitted in unconscious state

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#155:2:B>
The first neuro logic examination states it as follows

<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#156:2:B>
confused but talking not obeying commands

<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#157:2:B>
If I may just make

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#158:2:A>
But it must show that therefore she was conscious

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#159:2:B>
No if I might make a note about the word the interpretation
of the word conscious

<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#160:2:B>
Consciousness from a neuro logic view in examining a person is a
spectrum

<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#161:2:B>
On one spectrum one end of it is the person who totally comatose
without any kind of response and at the other extreme is a person who is
totally normal in function

<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#162:2:B>
And in between these there are gradations of consciousness

<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#163:2:B>
And one of the important parameters we go by is whether the person
can follow instructions

<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#164:2:B>
If the person cannot follow instructions then a lot of those
mental functions that you have asked about like memory emotional liability
and all this cannot in any way be tested

<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#165:2:B>
Neither are they of any

<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#166:2:B>
They're all impaired because that person is not in communication
with his environment even though he is sort of awake in the sense that his
eyes are open

<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#167:2:B>
So that would be impaired consciousness

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#168:2:A>
But according to the hospital records she was not admitted in
an unconscious state although

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#169:2:B>
She was not admitted in a comatose state

<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#170:2:B>
But she was admitted

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#171:2:C>
So the person was confused is confused

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#172:2:B>
She's admitted confused

<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#173:2:B>
Unable to follow any instructions

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#174:2:A>
But not comatose

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#175:2:B>
Not comatose

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#176:2:A>
And the reference to her becoming conscious on the tenth day
after admission

<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#177:2:A>
Would you agree that that is the day when she can probably
communicate with he environment understand instructions and so on

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#178:2:B>
Yes that's probably when she began to follow some
instructions

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#179:2:A>
Now during the stage when a patient or person is not in a
conscious state because she was not able to communicate with the environment

<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#180:2:A>
Would such a patient also have problems with incontinence and
problems relating to controlling the bowel

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#181:2:B>
Yes in the sense that they will not ask to go to the bathroom
or things like that

<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#182:2:B>
and so they have social incontinence the mechanism itself is
working

<ICE-SIN:S1B-061#183:2:B>
But they don't have the mental ability to take care of themselves
