<ICE-SIN:S2B-029#1:1:A>
I'm Lisa and welcome to Hey Singapore

<ICE-SIN:S2B-029#2:1:A>
Tonight our story is more of curiosity rather than a mystery

<ICE-SIN:S2B-029#3:1:A>
It's about inventions local inventions

<ICE-SIN:S2B-029#4:1:A>
Inventions that were patented as early as the nineteen sixties

<ICE-SIN:S2B-029#5:1:A>
Many of these inventions can be found in the files of CESA

<ICE-SIN:S2B-029#6:1:A>
Today Singaporeans continue to put down their patents

<ICE-SIN:S2B-029#7:1:A>
Unfortunately due to the high costs of producing a prototype and
mass production many of them remained just patent inventions

<ICE-SIN:S2B-029#8:1:A>
Today we go in search for the inventive Singaporean

<ICE-SIN:S2B-029#9:1:A>
Tonight we dig into the little known world of local inventors and
their inventions starting with this strange gadget

<ICE-SIN:S2B-029#10:1:A>
What is it

<ICE-SIN:S2B-029#11:1:A>
Well it's used on something close to many of us

<ICE-SIN:S2B-029#12:1:A>
In fact it was invented to deal with a very thorny issue

<ICE-SIN:S2B-029#13:1:A>
We asked some people what they thought it was

<ICE-SIN:S2B-029#14:1:A>
No one seems to have any idea

<ICE-SIN:S2B-029#15:1:A>
What is it

<ICE-SIN:S2B-029#16:1:A>
Well the answer lies here at the Ngee Ann Polytechnic

<ICE-SIN:S2B-029#17:1:A>
You see the strange device is the work of these students who are
about to reveal to us what it does

<ICE-SIN:S2B-029#18:1:A>
Watch closely

<ICE-SIN:S2B-029#19:1:A>
A durian opener

<ICE-SIN:S2B-029#20:1:A>
These final year students took about three months to think up of
the idea and to make the device from scratch

<ICE-SIN:S2B-029#21:1:A>
This unusual opener can soon be available for a mere twenty dollars

<ICE-SIN:S2B-029#22:1:A>
Our producer decided to try her hand on the durian opener after a
few false starts she finally gets the hang of it

<ICE-SIN:S2B-029#23:1:A>
And she does find it quite effective

<ICE-SIN:S2B-029#24:1:A>
But this is just our amateur opinion would the experts agree

<ICE-SIN:S2B-029#25:1:A>
We brought the durian opener here at the junction of Albert and
Queen Street to put it to the test

<ICE-SIN:S2B-029#26:1:A>
Seems no one is willing to give our strange looking tool a try
until we come across Mr Chong with many years behind him selling durians

<ICE-SIN:S2B-029#27:1:A>
He was not impressed

<ICE-SIN:S2B-029#28:1:A>
Not satisfied we sought a second opinion Mr Ong is another long
time durian seller maybe he has a different opinion

<ICE-SIN:S2B-029#29:1:A>
But he didn't have an easy time of it

<ICE-SIN:S2B-029#30:1:A>
After much sweating and swearing he managed to open a durian

<ICE-SIN:S2B-029#31:1:A>
So all's not lost

<ICE-SIN:S2B-029#32:1:A>
The durian sellers we spoke to were somewhat encouraging they felt
that the durian opener might be more useful for housewives than for the
professionals

<ICE-SIN:S2B-029#33:1:A>
But the idea is a good one and with some modifications perhaps this
durian opener might be more effective

<ICE-SIN:S2B-029#34:1:A>
Our next invention is one that starts here where we came across an
unusual phenomenon

<ICE-SIN:S2B-029#35:1:A>
Locked letterboxes what good are locked letterboxes

<ICE-SIN:S2B-029#36:1:A>
How will the postman deliver the mail

<ICE-SIN:S2B-029#37:1:A>
We traced these unusual letterboxes to a local inventor Mr Henry
Tan

<ICE-SIN:S2B-029#38:1:A>
Henry an ex-police constable of many years started working on an
idea to keep junk mail out of our letter boxes

<ICE-SIN:S2B-029#39:1:A>
An anti-junk mail letter box

<ICE-SIN:S2B-029#40:1:A>
The path to the final product did not come easily

<ICE-SIN:S2B-029#41:1:A>
It began with sketches and drawings followed by many prototypes the
earliest which is this one

<ICE-SIN:S2B-029#42:1:A>
How did Henry come on the idea for an anti-junk mail letter box

<ICE-SIN:S2B-029#43:1:A>
He told us he was once nearly arrested for littering when clearing
his junk mail

<ICE-SIN:S2B-029#44:1:A>
So for all of us in HDB units maybe an end to junk mail

<ICE-SIN:S2B-029#45:1:A>
HDB and a bright sunny day

<ICE-SIN:S2B-029#46:1:A>
Perfect for housewives to hang out their freshly washed clothes to
dry

<ICE-SIN:S2B-029#47:1:A>
Or is it

<ICE-SIN:S2B-029#48:1:A>
Living in high-rise flats we all encounter the problem of
inconsiderate neighbours who let their wet clothes drip all the way down

<ICE-SIN:S2B-029#49:1:A>
Down to our carefully washed laundry and what happens

<ICE-SIN:S2B-029#50:1:A>
Our clothes become soiled of course

<ICE-SIN:S2B-029#51:1:A>
Is there a solution

<ICE-SIN:S2B-029#52:1:A>
Yes there is

<ICE-SIN:S2B-029#53:1:A>
At the Temasek Polytechnic School of Engineering

<ICE-SIN:S2B-029#54:1:A>
We asked Mr ? ? Teo and his students what they have come up with

<ICE-SIN:S2B-029#55:1:A>
A retractable clothes shelter

<ICE-SIN:S2B-029#56:1:A>
This device is unique because it lets heat rays in through the
transparent shelter to dry the clothes but protects the clothes from being
soiled

<ICE-SIN:S2B-029#57:1:A>
The invention can be commercialised though it cost the students
three hundred dollars to build it

<ICE-SIN:S2B-029#58:1:A>
Mass production should bring the price down

<ICE-SIN:S2B-029#59:1:A>
So now there's no need to get frustrated or irritated

<ICE-SIN:S2B-029#60:1:A>
Just go get retractable clothes shelter

<ICE-SIN:S2B-029#61:1:A>
And all this dripping and soiling of our freshly washed clothes
will be a thing of the past

<ICE-SIN:S2B-029#62:1:A>
Well although some of you may find that a rather strange invention
it's actually quite a practical idea

<ICE-SIN:S2B-029#63:1:A>
We are now here at the National Archives Retro-spin

<ICE-SIN:S2B-029#64:1:A>
An exhibition of sounds in Singapore from the fifties to the
nineties and it is here at this exhibition that we were to make an amazing
discovery

<ICE-SIN:S2B-029#65:1:A>
This man here Jay Shotam he was the lead singer of one of the most
popular groups in Singapore called the October Cherries back in the nineteen
seventies

<ICE-SIN:S2B-029#66:1:A>
Jay and his brother claimed that they patented the first portable
cassette player and filed it in London in nineteen seventy-six

<ICE-SIN:S2B-029#67:1:A>
Unfortunately due to lack of funds for mass production the patent
lapsed

<ICE-SIN:S2B-029#68:1:A>
When we come back we speak to Jay Shotam and we take a look at some
other amazing inventions by Singaporeans

<ICE-SIN:S2B-029#69:1:A>
Early this year the National Archives was planning an exhibition of
the sounds of Singapore from the fifties

<ICE-SIN:S2B-029#70:1:A>
The exhibition is on at the National Museum to the twenty second of
September and it was here that we were to uncover a most unusual story

<ICE-SIN:S2B-029#71:1:A>
The story of a man named Jay Shotam lead singer the group October
Cherries who claimed he patented the portable cassette player now more
commonly called the Walkman

<ICE-SIN:S2B-029#72:1:A>
It's here that we meet Mr Jay Shotam he has an amazing story to
tell us

<ICE-SIN:S2B-029#73:1:A>
A story so fantastic that we won't have believed it if not for the
evidence

<ICE-SIN:S2B-029#74:1:A>
If you think that the concept behind the portable cassette player
came from Japan you may well be mistaken

<ICE-SIN:S2B-029#75:1:A>
About twenty years ago four years before the launched product Jay
had invented a combined portable cassette player and headphone set

<ICE-SIN:S2B-029#76:1:A>
In the old days if you wanted to listen to music on the move well
you had to lurk one of these around

<ICE-SIN:S2B-029#77:1:A>
This is the story of Mr Jay Shotam the rest as they say is history

<ICE-SIN:S2B-029#78:1:A>
We move on to the other end of Singapore to find our next local
inventor

<ICE-SIN:S2B-029#79:1:A>
He's Mr Pang Lian Seng and he's been dabbling in inventions for the
past twenty years

<ICE-SIN:S2B-029#80:1:A>
We asked him what he had come up with and he pulled this out of his
bag

<ICE-SIN:S2B-029#81:1:A>
A self-cleaning duster

<ICE-SIN:S2B-029#82:1:A>
The duster works with a cleaning material mounted on rollers a
device inside removes chalk dust and other particles that collect in a
reservoir

<ICE-SIN:S2B-029#83:1:A>
Mr Pang had patented his invention not only in Singapore but also
as far away as UK

<ICE-SIN:S2B-029#84:1:A>
Why so many patents

<ICE-SIN:S2B-029#85:1:A>
He tells us there isn't a body for world-wide patents and if
inventors wanted to protect their ideas world-wide they must take up
individual patents issued I each country

<ICE-SIN:S2B-029#86:1:A>
Back in the Ngee Ann Polytechnic we had come across a durian opener

<ICE-SIN:S2B-029#87:1:A>
Well here another local culinary dish caught the attention of
another group of students

<ICE-SIN:S2B-029#88:1:A>
? ? satay grilling machine

<ICE-SIN:S2B-029#89:1:A>
Electric heaters inside this contraption cooks satay as the satay
swirls around inside

<ICE-SIN:S2B-029#90:1:A>
But the most important question is does the satay still taste as
good as those grilled over glowing charcoal

<ICE-SIN:S2B-029#91:1:A>
And here are more wacky inventions from our Ngee Ann Polytechnic
students

<ICE-SIN:S2B-029#92:1:A>
When we come back after the break we take a look at how one man
invented a product which is currently used by penguins and others who are
still trying to make their inventive dream a reality

<ICE-SIN:S2B-029#93:1:A>
Our search for local inventions has led us to the Singapore Bird
Park more specifically to the penguin display

<ICE-SIN:S2B-029#94:1:A>
Amazingly we learned that the health and well-being of these
penguins are partly dependent on a Singaporean invention

<ICE-SIN:S2B-029#95:1:A>
The germitrol what is the germitrol

<ICE-SIN:S2B-029#96:1:A>
To find out we tracked down Mr Derek Seah owner of Air Search
Technology

<ICE-SIN:S2B-029#97:1:A>
And the germitrol an air cleaner that kills germs

<ICE-SIN:S2B-029#98:1:A>
This idea crew from a unique experience

<ICE-SIN:S2B-029#99:1:A>
But how do you measure whether germs air-borne germs emphasises
Derek are effectively killed

<ICE-SIN:S2B-029#100:1:A>
This device does it

<ICE-SIN:S2B-029#101:1:A>
Armed now with a better idea of the germitrol we decided to check
it out in action

<ICE-SIN:S2B-029#102:1:A>
Here inside the penguin enclosure

<ICE-SIN:S2B-029#103:1:A>
A rare opportunity to be on the other side of the glass

<ICE-SIN:S2B-029#104:1:A>
Amidst these curious and nosy penguins we saw the installed units
working away to keep the air germ-free for these birds

<ICE-SIN:S2B-029#105:1:A>
Although the germitrol works invisibly Dr Wong from the Bird Park
ensures us the units work

<ICE-SIN:S2B-029#106:1:A>
The penguins are not the only ones benefiting from the invention
these little puffins who also live in enclosed artificially maintained
environments also benefit from the germitrol

<ICE-SIN:S2B-029#107:1:A>
We're pretty sure that when Derek first drew up his sketches and
prototypes he wasn't thinking of penguins and puffins but the invention has a
way of ending up in the most unexpected places

<ICE-SIN:S2B-029#108:1:A>
We leave our feathered friends and head east to Eunos

<ICE-SIN:S2B-029#109:1:A>
He had wind of another local inventor frequently around the area

<ICE-SIN:S2B-029#110:1:A>
He's Mr Gan Chiu Liang and his invention

<ICE-SIN:S2B-029#111:1:A>
A strange looking crate

<ICE-SIN:S2B-029#112:1:A>
What is it

<ICE-SIN:S2B-029#113:1:A>
Well we have to curb our curiosity as Mr Gan can only demonstrate
his invention elsewhere

<ICE-SIN:S2B-029#114:1:A>
Our destination here at the Marina Square

<ICE-SIN:S2B-029#115:1:A>
We stopped at this half hour photo lab and waited patiently for Mr
Gan to arrive which he soon did

<ICE-SIN:S2B-029#116:1:A>
Putting together his invention was a puzzle as Mr Gan started with
this camera

<ICE-SIN:S2B-029#117:1:A>
Then this a special laser printer

<ICE-SIN:S2B-029#118:1:A>
In minutes Mr Gan finally had his invention up and running

<ICE-SIN:S2B-029#119:1:A>
What does it do

<ICE-SIN:S2B-029#120:1:A>
This is Mr Gan's visual card system a system that creates and
prints cards lie these or this

<ICE-SIN:S2B-029#121:1:A>
Our crew tried Mr Gan's visual card system and we learned a unique
feature of the system

<ICE-SIN:S2B-029#122:1:A>
Have your own photo on your name card so that's what the camera's
for

<ICE-SIN:S2B-029#123:1:A>
How does it all work

<ICE-SIN:S2B-029#124:1:A>
Well it uses ordinary photographic film

<ICE-SIN:S2B-029#125:1:A>
We watched as the designs we had created appeared in this photo
processing machine

<ICE-SIN:S2B-029#126:1:A>
And as the pictures appear we saw our camera man a photo of
himself on his very own personalised name card all in about half an hour

<ICE-SIN:S2B-029#127:1:A>
Name cards are not the only things you can create with Mr Gan's
system

<ICE-SIN:S2B-029#128:1:A>
How about giving away a unique birthday invitation like this one

<ICE-SIN:S2B-029#129:1:A>
So Singaporeans especially teenagers can look forward to creating
anything

<ICE-SIN:S2B-029#130:1:A>
These samples should give you an idea of what to expect

<ICE-SIN:S2B-029#131:1:A>
though still in a prototype stage we were impressed that only with
this but also the other inventions of Singapore you have seen today

<ICE-SIN:S2B-029#132:1:A>
Though some inventions may not be that practical we did come
across a few very enthusiastic inventors with rather brilliant ideas

<ICE-SIN:S2B-029#133:1:A>
Some of which have been taken up on by manufacturers and are
currently out in the market

<ICE-SIN:S2B-029#134:1:A>
Others remain in their planning stages

<ICE-SIN:S2B-029#135:1:A>
And for anyone that makes it in the market hundreds remain
untouched

<ICE-SIN:S2B-029#136:1:A>
But inventors being inventors never give up

<ICE-SIN:S2B-029#137:1:A>
I'm Lisa goodnight </I>

<ICE-SIN:S2B-029#138:2:B>
The body's need for fluid is often neglected until one feels
thirsty

<ICE-SIN:S2B-029#139:2:B>
By the time you feel thirsty enough to reach for a drink you are
already dehydrated

<ICE-SIN:S2B-029#140:2:B>
Next to oxygen water is a silent nutrient that is most needed for
life

<ICE-SIN:S2B-029#141:2:B>
Besides keeping body temperatures stable water carries nutrients
eliminates toxins and waste products maintains blood volume and provides the
medium in which self-chemical reactions occur

<ICE-SIN:S2B-029#142:2:B>
If too much fluid is lost blood pressure falls and less oxygen
gets to the brain

<ICE-SIN:S2B-029#143:2:B>
In addition blood thickens and can't reach small blood vessels

<ICE-SIN:S2B-029#144:2:B>
Each person needs at least two litres of water a day

<ICE-SIN:S2B-029#145:2:B>
Even if you are inactive your body loses up to two litres of water
a day

<ICE-SIN:S2B-029#146:2:B>
Believe it or not that's six to eight glasses so it's important to
drink regularly even if you are not thirsty

<ICE-SIN:S2B-029#147:2:B>
Just watch out for caffeine laden beverage and alcohol

<ICE-SIN:S2B-029#148:2:B>
Though they are fluid sources they actually dehydrate the body
after consumption

<ICE-SIN:S2B-029#149:2:B>
For pure drinking water is good

<ICE-SIN:S2B-029#150:2:B>
Liquid intake not only comes from beverages or the water we drink
it's also in foods so they too can count towards your daily intake </I>
