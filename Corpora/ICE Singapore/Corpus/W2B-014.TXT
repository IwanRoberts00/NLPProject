<h> REASONS FOR SUICIDAL BEHAVIOUR </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-014#7:1>
In an era when people wish to live longer, when medical science is
improving health care, revolutionising treatment and prolonging lives, why do
some people resort to suicidal behaviour?

<ICE-SIN:W2B-014#8:1>
What leads them to do such acts?

<ICE-SIN:W2B-014#9:1>
Dr E S Schneidman, a well-known psychologist and pioneer in
suicidology ( the study of suicidal behaviour) believes that in order to
understand the act of suicide, it is important to first grasp the following
characteristics of suicidal acts.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-014#10:1>
1 There is intolerable psychic pain and discomfort because of
frustrated psychological needs.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-014#11:1>
This could be a need to be loved, to be wanted, and to be safe, that
is, not to be persecuted ( in the case of those with mental disorders).

<ICE-SIN:W2B-014#12:1>
In those with physical illness, intolerable physical pain and
discomfort could lead to psychic distress.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-014#13:1>
2 The purpose of each suicidal act is to seek a solution.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-014#14:1>
3 The goal is to lose consciousness and blot out the pain.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-014#15:1>
4 The emotion that is frequently present is that of helplessness,
hopelessness, anger or fear.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-014#16:1>
5 The mind is narrowly focused on the act and other matters are not
considered.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-014#17:1>
In general, when a person has reached the decision to die, he feels
that life is meaningless and he loses the will to live.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-014#18:1>
If the suicide is associated with great anger and hostility, there is
an urge to kill oneself, to be killed and to die.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-014#19:1>
As that wish to die becomes active, the fear of death which is so
common in nearly everyone disappears, and death becomes inviting.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-014#20:1>
The decision to kill oneself requires a great deal of mental energy.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-014#21:1>
Prior to doing so one is beset by doubts, fears, anxieties and
worries.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-014#22:1>
Arriving at a decision to kill oneself is like crossing a turbulent
river.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-014#23:1>
Once beyond that, peace prevails - one's fears are quietened, the
consciousness is restricted to the task at hand and one can start making
preparations to kill oneself.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-014#24:1>
However, the above situation only applies to those who have a
premeditated plan for suicide.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-014#25:1>
If the act is an impulsive one, and the deed is done on the spur of
the moment, the psychological processes described above do not occur.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-014#26:1>
Instead, the person acts without much thought, as a result of an
overpowering emotion like anger or frustration.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-014#27:1>
<h> Suicide </h> Suicidal behaviour is classified as suicide if the
person dies as a result of the suicide act.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-014#28:1>
If the person survives the act of self-injury or self-poisoning, it
is called attempted suicide.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-014#29:1>
Individual reasons for suicide or attempted suicide may be similar
and include the following.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-014#30:1>
1 A feeling of helplessness, hopelessness and despair over an
insoluble problem.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-014#31:1>
2 Fear, anguish, worry or depression.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-014#32:1>
Sometimes imaginary voices are heard which repeat incessantly that
the subject should die.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-014#33:1>
In certain people, deluded beliefs of persecution also result in
suicide.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-014#34:1>
Thus in those whose suicides arise out of mental illness, their
thoughts or moods are bleak and they feel that death is the only way out.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-014#35:1>
Life is intolerable.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-014#36:1>
3 Physical illness, discomfort and despair at not being able to get
well again.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-014#37:1>
In some elderly people with illnesses, the reason for killing
themselves could also be that of altruism, i.e., that they feel it is better
for them to die than to burden their families with their care, both
physically and financially.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-014#38:1>
4 Feelings of intense anger and a wish for revenge against someone
who has done them a great wrong.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-014#39:1>
It has been said by Sigmund Freud that suicide is anger and hostility
directed inwards into oneself leading to self-destruction, whereas homicide
is this anger directed outwardly at another.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-014#40:1>
5 A wish to join someone greatly loved who has died and left the
bereaved all alone without a reason for living.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-014#41:1>
<h> Attempted Suicide </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-014#42:1>
The reasons for attempted suicide are similar to those of suicide if
there is an intention to die.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-014#43:1>
However, if there is no intention to die, the suicidal act is a
coping mechanism for solving problems.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-014#44:1>
Such behaviour can be termed parasuicide.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-014#45:1>
The reasons for this act may include.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-014#46:1>
1 An attempt to change the behaviour of another person, eg to
influence a person to behave nicely to the suicidal person, not to be cold,
hostile or rejecting.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-014#47:1>
2 A way to force someone to do the suicidal person's bidding, eg to
make a loved one leave a third party.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-014#48:1>
3 A method of letting someone know how miserable and desperate the
suicidal person is - a loved one may not realise how intolerable a situation
is to the suicidal person until he injures or harms himself.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-014#49:1>
4 A means of frightening someone, i.e., making him realise that the
suicidal person may die and he would be held responsible, perhaps by irate
and hostile family members or the police.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-014#50:1>
5 A method of getting attention and support from family and friends,
who view the suicidal person as a victim of circumstances.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-014#51:1>
6 A means of leaving the home or workplace for a while through
hospitalisation if there are intolerable stresses at home or at work.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-014#52:1>
7 An attempt to forget everything, by blotting out consciousness.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-014#53:1>
8 A call for help to cope with a situation that is very distressing
and there appears to be no way out.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-014#54:1>
Self-injury is often perceived by a suicidal person as a very
effective way of solving problems because the life-threatening behaviour is
usually taken seriously.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-014#55:1>
Unfortunately, the initial success of that behaviour 1n helping him
with the problem prompts him to repeat the action when faced with similar or
other problems.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-014#56:1>
Reactions of friends and family members to this type of behaviour may
change, as they become gradually frustrated and irritated by his repeated
actions.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-014#57:1>
If the suicidal person's problem-solving skills are poor, this may be
the only coping style he knows and he goes on repeating it.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-014#58:1>
This creates a vicious cycle where the repeated suicidal acts result
in the partner or relative becoming irritated and subsequently indifferent.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-014#59:1>
In turn, the suicidal person is depressed and upset because of the
perceived lack of concern and may attempt suicide again.

<h> 2) HISTORY OF SUICIDAL BEHAVIOUR </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-014#61:1>
<h> Suicide </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-014#62:1>
Suicide is known to have been practised during the early history of
mankind.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-014#63:1>
It is described in the Old Testament when Saul fell upon his sword
and died after he was severely wounded in battle to escape capture.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-014#64:1>
Judas Iscariot killed himself by hanging because of his remorse at
betraying his friend and master, Jesus Christ.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-014#65:1>
In the East, the Chinese 5th Moon Dumpling Festival was said to have
originated from a suicide by Chu Yuan, a loyal minister of the state of Chu (
287 BC).

<ICE-SIN:W2B-014#66:1>
He tied a rock to himself and jumped into the river to protest
against corrupt officials who had turned the king against him.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-014#67:1>
Suicides of honour to avoid capture, humiliation and death were
frequent among the early Greeks, Romans and Chinese.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-014#68:1>
The last emperor of the Chinese Ming Dynasty committed suicide when
his empire was captured by the Chings.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-014#69:1>
To the Japanese, suicide was accepted as an honourable act for the
sake of face, to show loyalty to a king, commander or company, or as a way of
assuming ultimate responsibility for a loss, failure or disgrace.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-014#70:1>
The best-known study on suicide which included statistical data was
by E Durkheim ( 1897) who used sociological concepts to explain the causes of
suicide.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-014#71:1>
He divided them into three types.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-014#72:1>
<h> 1) Egoistic suicide </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-014#73:1>
This is caused by the lack of social interaction ( integration) and
stems from excessive individualism.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-014#74:1>
Such persons live by their own rules and are not well integrated into
their society.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-014#75:1>
There are too few ties bonding them with their community and they do
not share the beliefs and practices of a common collective life.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-014#76:1>
These people have to rely on their own resources, and because they
have few friends, they have no one to turn to in times of crisis.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-014#77:1>
The change in the traditional family system also makes such people
vulnerable to suicide, as the ties with the complex family network which used
to exist are loosened.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-014#78:1>
Marriage increases ties among people, while divorce loosens them.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-014#79:1>
Thus married people usually have lower suicide rates than the
divorced or widowed.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-014#80:1>
<h> 2) Anomic suicide </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-014#81:1>
This results from a sudden change in a person's social position,
leading to stresses he is unable to cope with.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-014#82:1>
It happens when a person faces poverty or unemployment, or during
natural disasters.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-014#83:1>
Other conditions include changes in marital status such as divorce or
widowhood.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-014#84:1>
In such situations, Durkheim believed that the basic mood would be
anger, irritation and frustration, leading to angry feelings towards life or
a particular person, resulting sometimes in murder-suicide.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-014#85:1>
<h> 3) Altruistic suicide </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-014#86:1>
This occurs when a person is so closely integrated with his society
that he completely subordinates his own desires to the will of the group.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-014#87:1>
Such suicides used to be observed among sick and dying Eskimos who
ran into blizzards during winter.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-014#88:1>
The group is so important to an individual that its survival is more
important than his own.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-014#89:1>
Other examples are those of an elderly person who commits suicide in
order not to become a liability to his family, or acts of heroism found
during wars and disasters when an individual sacrifices himself so that
others can be saved.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-014#90:1>
After Durkheim, other researchers including sociologists, medical
epidemiologists and psychiatrists examined and expanded the study of suicide
to include variables such as age, sex, race, marital status and precipitating
factors to understand the phenomenon better.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-014#91:1>
Attempted Suicide Attempted suicide was originally perceived as
failed suicide.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-014#92:1>
Later, researchers in the 1940s to 1960s, prominent among whom were E
Stengel and N G Cook, came to realise that attempted suicide was a behaviour
in its own right which showed many different and opposing characteristics to
suicide.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-014#93:1>
They noted that in attempted suicide, the self-injury was not serious
enough to result in death and was usually done in settings where the
intervention of others was highly likely.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-014#94:1>
They also noted that in each attempt, there was an appeal for help
from others, but there was also an ordeal factor, ie there were two opposing
aims - one at dying, and the other at living.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-014#95:1>
It was noted that nearly all suicide attempters accepted their
survival.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-014#96:1>
Since the monograph by Stengel and Cook on 'Attempted Suicides' in
1961, thousands of publications have appeared on this topic.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-014#97:1>
<h> Religious and Legal Aspects of Suicide </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-014#98:1>
Public attitudes towards suicide range from outright condemnation to
admiration.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-014#99:1>
Historically, suicide was forbidden in slaves and servants.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-014#100:1>
The early Christians denounced suicide as a sin.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-014#101:1>
From the Middle Ages to the 18th century, the penalties for suicide
included confiscation of property, degradation of the corpse including
hammering a stake through the heart or hanging it from the gallows) and
refusal of burial in consecrated ground.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-014#102:1>
After the 18th century, the view of suicide changed and society
became more tolerant of it and perceived it to be linked to melancholia.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-014#103:1>
Other religions like Islam prohibits suicide, while the Buddhist
religion shows more tolerance.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-014#104:1>
The law relating to suicide varies from country to country.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-014#105:1>
In Singapore, according to Section 309 of the Penal Code, " whoever
attempts to commit suicide shall be punished with imprisonment for a term
which may be extended to two years, or with a fine, or with both".

<ICE-SIN:W2B-014#106:1>
In practice, only under very special circumstances is the law
applied, and in those cases it must be proven beyond doubt that the suicide
act is intentional and potentially fatal.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-014#107:1>
Thus few, if any, cases are prosecuted, although all cases of
attempted suicide admitted to hospitals have to be reported to the police.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-014#108:1>
The police interview the suicide attempters to determine the reasons
for the act, but rarely proceed to file charges.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-014#109:1>
In cases of marital dispute where a person has been victimised, the
police often call up the alleged abuser for questioning. <X>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-014#X110:1>
This can prove very helpful for the suicidal person if the alleged
abuser is deterred from further violence for fear of police action.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-014#X111:1>
The other law relating to suicide is assisting or abetting the
commission of suicide, and the punishment in this instance is more severe, as
the perpetrator is liable to imprisonment for a term of up to 10 years, in
addition to a fine. </X> </I>
