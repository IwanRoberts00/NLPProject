<h> <bold> Creative business </bold> </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-003#2:1>
<p> IMAGINE you are in a cramped, little-known watering hole, on stage with
your band.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-003#3:1>
The spotlights are shining and you are belting out a Madonna hit.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-003#4:1>
Several people approach you after your performance.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-003#5:1>
They say you have talent.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-003#6:1>
They want to promote and develop you.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-003#7:1>
They will help you get contracts at good nightclubs.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-003#8:1>
You will make a lot of money...

<ICE-SIN:W2E-003#9:1>
This, for many budding musicians in Singapore is the stuff dreams are
made of.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-003#10:1>
But it might well be a reality now.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-003#11:1>
Since early this year, a team of people have been sussing out local
creative talent.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-003#12:1>
They look out for, and nurture, those with a flair not only in the
field of music but in acting, dancing, painting, movie-making, song writing,
cinematography and design.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-003#13:1>
These people are officers from the 10-month-old Economic Development
Board's Creative Services Strategic Business Unit ( SBU).

<ICE-SIN:W2E-003#14:1>
Their mission: to invest in worthy creative talent and generate a
creative services industry as part of Singapore's continuing economic
development. </p>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-003#15:1>
<p> The setting up of the Creative Services SBU is timely.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-003#16:1>
No one can disagree that, for far too long, creative talent has been
ignored as a factor in Singapore's economy.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-003#17:1>
Those in the creative fields, be they singers, actors, dancers or
painters, have generally found it unprofitable to make a living out of their
art.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-003#18:1>
At best it is a vocation, but hardly ever a career.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-003#19:1>
The often cited reasons include the lack of financial backing,
opportunities and people to manage them.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-003#20:1>
Society too has traditionally placed little value on a career in the
arts, giving priority instead to more stable professions like engineering,
medicine and law.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-003#21:1>
While this is true in many countries, it is true to a much greater
degree in a developing nation like Singapore, which has had to concentrate
most of its resources and energies on material achievements. </p>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-003#22:1>
<p> Over the past five years, however, there has been a slow, but sure,
blossoming of the local arts scene.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-003#23:1>
Note the number of local singers, actors, writers, playwrights and
photographers who have emerged.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-003#24:1>
Note too the growing clout of local fashion designers.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-003#25:1>
In recent years, the Government has also spoken much about its
vision of Singapore in the 1990s as a society of gracious, cultured people.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-003#26:1>
The impending formation of the Ministry of Information and the Arts
and the establishment of the National Arts Council are further signs of this
new emphasis on the aesthetic side of life. </p>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-003#27:1>
<p> In light of this, there is a dire need for an organ like the Creative
Services SBU to home in on a potentially important industry.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-003#28:1>
Indeed, armed with what has been termed an <quote> arsenal of
incentives </quote> like tax reliefs and training grants, the unit has
already embarked on several ambitious projects.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-003#29:1>
It has made remarkable headway in the movie-making field, which has
identified as having the most potential to take off.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-003#30:1>
The lucrative foreign investments it has secured include the
setting up of Hongkong actor Eric Tsang's Movie Impact Singapore Pte Ltd.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-003#31:1>
The unit has also encouraged Golden Harvest to set up a multiplex
cinema theatre in Yishun New Town as well as the building of a
&dollar;50 million Tang Dynasty Village in Jurong which will house three movie
studios.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-003#32:1>
But a word of caution must be sounded.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-003#33:1>
The Creative Services SBU must remember that while it is not its aim
to be a champion of the arts, or an instigator of social change, it cannot
deny its indirect role in shaping the cultural life and tastes of
Singaporeans.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-003#34:1>
The artistic merit of any project it wants to embark on must always
be given due consideration.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-003#35:1>
Quality should not give way to commercial viability, and there must
be a stringent artistic base-line standard which it must follow.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-003#36:1>
It is also to be hoped that the unit will not devote too much of its
resources on big organisations with big bucks.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-003#37:1>
While they are the ones who can bring in millions of dollars to the
economy, there are also many talented individual artistes out
there waiting to be given attention and help. </p> </I>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-003#38:2>
<h> <bold> Designs on the future </bold> </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-003#39:2>
<p> <quote> MADE in Singapore. </quote> Will the label become world-famous
for good design?

<ICE-SIN:W2E-003#40:2>
That is the exciting goal of the Singapore Design Council, to
be set up next year by the Trade Development Board.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-003#41:2>
The goal of design excellence is ambitious, but the challenge must be
faced head on.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-003#42:2>
Aptly, the establishment of the council was announced last
Thursday at the opening of the Second International Design Forum.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-003#43:2>
The conference, which ended on Saturday, provided ample evidence that
only with a serious commitment to better design can Singapore industry
make it in the big league.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-003#44:2>
From television sets to telephones, coffee pots to children's
slides, the goods on display showed the high standards of design that
Singapore manufacturers must strive for.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-003#45:2>
From next year, their efforts will be supported by the design
council, which will include an Institute of Design at the Nanyang
Technological University, and a Design Centre. </p>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-003#46:2>
<p> There is of course no single approach to good design.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-003#47:2>
This too, was demonstrated at last week's exhibition in the sheer
range of products and styles.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-003#48:2>
At the United Kingdom pavilion stood the suit of armour worn by
Kenneth Branagh in his movie production of William Shakespeare's Henry V,
which won this year's Academy Award for costume design.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-003#49:2>
Across the hall, at the Japanese pavilion, was a display of the
latest in personal computer graphics.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-003#50:2>
Included was an architect's and engineer's dream tool: a
computer-aided-design package for three dimensional simulations,
capable of generating 16 million shades of colour.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-003#51:2>
Good design can therefore mean anything from hand-crafting a replica
of a 15th-century outfit that is part of a nation's heritage, to using
keyboard and mouse to produce images of future products that exist only in
the imagination. </p>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-003#52:2>
<p> But no matter what the industry, the proposed Design Council can have
real impact across the board if it can establish in the minds of present and
future manufacturers that <X> <quote> design adds value </quote> </X> ,
as the theme of last week's conference put it.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-003#53:2>
It can also help by showing that design is not like a coat of paint
added as an afterthought at the end of the manufacturing process, or, worse,
clever packaging to hide shoddy workmanship.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-003#54:2>
Instead, good design, if it is to win the confidence and
loyalty of increasingly discerning consumers, has to be incorporated into
every stage of the production process.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-003#55:2>
As important, there needs to be a recognition that good industrial
design differs from art in one crucial respect: Form never gets in the
way of function.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-003#56:2>
Some of the entries for the Young Designers Award showed that
creative energy needs to be tempered with a sense of practicality.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-003#57:2>
Good design is more than just aesthetics; it is also about
value to the user. </p>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-003#58:2>
<p> As for the proposed Design Centre, it could play a valuable role in
raising the design consciousness of local producers and consumers.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-003#59:2>
As one designer who spoke at last week's conference noted, many
poorly designed products in the world today are copies of other poorly
designed products.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-003#60:2>
A Design Centre that serves as a repository of good design will help
to break the cycle, providing a reference point and helping to raise
standards. </p>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-003#61:2>
<p> A final plea should be made on behalf of the Singapore consumer.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-003#62:2>
The Trade Development Board has said that the design council would
improve Singapore's competitiveness in world markets.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-003#63:2>
The domestic consumer should not be forgotten.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-003#64:2>
For too long, Singaporeans have come under what could be called
design imperialism.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-003#65:2>
The tyranny of foreign design has imposed on Singapore materials and
designs quite unsuited to local conditions.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-003#66:2>
Examples range from video-cassettes which are very quickly
attacked by fungus in the heat and humidity, to the <quote> Fall Collection
</quote> syndrome, of totally inappropriate seasonal fashions from
Europe and North America.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-003#67:2>
If the design council nurtures an independent and talented pool
of local designers able to meet Singaporeans' practical and sophisticated
needs with more appropriate colours, styles and materials, that in
itself would be a major success. </p> </I>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-003#68:3>
<h> <bold> Encore, sponsors </bold> </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-003#69:3>
<p> THE applause was short-lived for a recently concluded series of
plays by TheatreWorks, but not because audiences were unappreciative.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-003#70:3>
Night after night, members of TheatreWorks, Singapore's main
professional drama group, interrupted the applause to make impassioned pleas
for funds.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-003#71:3>
Partly because of the sudden withdrawal of one corporate sponsor, the
group found itself short of
&dollar;93.000 for renovations of its new premises at Fort Canning Hill.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-003#72:3>
TheatreWorks' plight draws attention to the wider issue of
funding for the Arts in general.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-003#73:3>
The situation may only get worse.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-003#74:3>
With an economic slowdown looming, it could well be the arts that
suffer as corporate backers pull out and audiences stay away. </p>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-003#75:3>
<p> Finding the money for the finer things is a universal problem, but it is
especially salient in Singapore, where the arts scene is at a critical stage.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-003#76:3>
For perhaps the first time, it seems that all the right ingredients
have been assembled and are simmering in the cultural pot, promising a rich
and varied diet of artistic offerings in years to come.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-003#77:3>
The signs have never been more encouraging.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-003#78:3>
On the part of audiences, the Singapore public is showing its growing
appetite for local performing arts, including the fairly serious.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-003#79:3>
Singapore Symphony Orchestra concerts are generally sold
out, as was the Retrospective series of experimental plays by TheatreWorks.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-003#80:3>
On the part of practitioners, a corps of talented Singaporeans is
clearly demonstrating a passionate commitment to their art.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-003#81:3>
Most are part-timers, filling their evenings with demanding
rehearsals and performances at the end of their regular day-jobs.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-003#82:3>
As for institutional backers, many are beginning to express their
faith in the future of Singapore arts.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-003#83:3>
For example, the British Council, instead of simply bringing in
British companies to perform, is inviting directors to work with Singaporean
theatre companies and to conduct theatre courses. </p>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-003#84:3>
<p> The final and easily the most important ingredient in this bubbling
broth has been a government that is increasingly supportive of the arts.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-003#85:3>
It has stated its intention to make Singapore a place where the arts
can flourish, and that Singaporeans have a legitimate need for
self-expression and enjoyment of cultural activities.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-003#86:3>
It has backed this up by, for example, featuring cultural
facilities prominently in its master plan for the Civic District.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-003#87:3>
It has poured in
&dollar;1.07 million to convert an old powerhouse into The Substation, a
privately-run multi-cultural arts centre.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-003#88:3>
The Government's perception of its role is refreshingly
progressive.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-003#89:3>
It wants to facilitate rather than prescribe, providing a framework
within which the arts can blossom unhampered by bureaucracy, although
this also means that arts groups cannot expect blank cheques from government.
</p>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-003#90:3>
<p> The momentum must be kept up.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-003#91:3>
Audiences should be prepared to experiment, to stretch their tastes
rather than patronise only activities which they know beforehand they will
enjoy.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-003#92:3>
Artistes need to produce better quality work, and more of it.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-003#93:3>
More urgently, they need strong administrative back-up, to reach out
to sponsors and ensure that they are well managed and fiscally responsible.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-003#94:3>
Government might be able to do more.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-003#95:3>
The licensing system may need to be reviewed, as the Advisory
Council on Culture and the Arts has proposed.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-003#96:3>
There continues to be some unhappiness among artistes that tax-exempt
status is not granted liberally enough, or in a clearly understood way.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-003#97:3>
In the end, however, it may be private sponsors who will decide if
the fledgling arts scene flourishes or shrivels.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-003#98:3>
Now that the arts are just about to really take off, it would be
tragic if they suddenly find themselves stalled because sponsors and would-be
sponsors are less generous with support in the economic downturn.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-003#99:3>
Instead of the culturally vibrant society it is on the way to
becoming, Singapore could again revert to a cultural desert.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-003#100:3>
It must not be allowed to happen. </p> </I>
<I>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-003#101:4>
<h> <bold> What makes a film artistic? </bold> </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-003#102:4>
<p> <smallcaps> WHEN </smallcaps> film classification was first
introduced on July 1, the film censor's only headache was deciding
what scene would be considered too explicit to be passed untouched.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-003#103:4>
Now with the amended R(A) rating, the censor's work will be even
more complicated: just what is an artistic movie? </p> <X>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-003#X104:4>
When the Government heeded public sentiment and called for a stop
to the flood of " soft-porn" movies flooding local cinemas, it perhaps
thought it was coming to an ideal compromise.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-003#X105:4>
It would stop all the rubbish from coming in, yet give serious
movie-goers some leeway by allowing the " good" stuff in.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-003#X106:4>
This ideal might work better if there existed clear-cut guidelines
as to what makes a movie artistic.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-003#X107:4>
So far, the guidelines have been general.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-003#X108:4>
A movie qualifies for the R(A) rating if it has a good storyline,
is not exploitative, violent or erotic.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-003#X109:4>
It should be critically acclaimed and have a credible cast.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-003#X110:4>
The reality, though, is that one critic's good movie is another
critic's toilet roll.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-003#X111:4>
It is very easy to weed out the usual rubbish such as Amy Yip's
strip-and-stare movies.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-003#X112:4>
What is less easy to identify, though, is the movie that considers
itself artistic, but in reality does not come close.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-003#X113:4>
Take Zandalee, a movie currently showing and which would have made
it to the screen under the R(A) rating.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-003#X114:4>
The movie is about a frustrated wife who seeks a lover, a theme
which wlll not have many parents jumping for joy.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-003#X115:4>
As another example, White Palace, a movie to be released under this
new rating, is about a young man who gets involved with a seedy waitress
almost 20 years his senior.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-003#X116:4>
Neither of them boast a strong story-line nor critical acclaim.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-003#X117:4>
If one of the main objections opponents of R-rated movies have is
not just the nudity but the so-called compromising of values that these
movies reflect, then this R(A) system is not going to make much difference.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-003#X118:4>
Quality, ultimately, is still subjective.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-003#X119:4>
There is no doubt that a lot of trash has been coming in since the
Government began to allow R-rated movies.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-003#X120:4>
But some figures show that attendance at such movies has been
falling of late, and cinema operators have shown signs of screening more
popular movies that do not require a minimum age limit.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-003#X121:4>
While it is good that the Government has shown that it does listen
to the views of the people, it must be said at the same time that things
should not be done in half measures.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-003#X122:4>
Considering that the classification of movies came about after
years of thought, to amend it with an R(A) system is almost tantamount to
going back to the old days, for the element of choice is no longer there.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-003#X123:4>
Raising the minimum age from 18 to 21 was sufficient.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-003#X124:4>
To go one step further and decree what is or is not artistic for
adults will not just go down poorly, it will be an incredibly difficult, if
not impossible, thing to do. </p> </X> </I>
