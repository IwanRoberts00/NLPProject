Secret loves of unfaithful women. By Pearl Lee. HER WORLD November
1995 </X>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-010#2:1>
'I'm thinking of cheating on him on a permanent basis,' she tells me
half-seriously, this intelligent, beautiful woman whom friends describe as a
bubbly, intriguing mix of angelic goodness and naughtiness.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-010#3:1>
Now 28, Ellen's been with her fiance 10 years, and will be getting
married in two months. Last year she had an affair / fling / dalliance
whatever you wish to call it which lasted an unrepentant eight months. She
went back to her fiance only because Man No. 2 wasn't interested in a
relationship.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-010#4:1>
Ellen, a marketing manager with a penchant for the expensive things in
life, had two-timed her fiance with another man she'd met through work.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-010#5:1>
It was her first and only fidelity to her college sweetheart.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-010#6:1>
She was, alternately, miserable, ecstatic, depressed, blissful,
wretched, excited while her fiance remained unaware throughout.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-010#7:1>
She isn't the only woman cheating on her man. Three other women, all
in their twenties, all attractive, smart, with devoted, unsuspecting
boyfriends told me they did the same.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-010#8:1>
The cheating game, once the sexual purview of the male species,
appears to have caught on with women now.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-010#9:1>
Some women don't cheat once either, but twice or more.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-010#10:1>
It's the Nineties are we finally getting even?

<ICE-SIN:W2B-010#11:1>
Before you answer, consider the following. Mei, a 24-year-old
student, had been with her boyfriend two years when she was introduced to
another man at a party her friends threw.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-010#12:1>
The affair lasted a month, but it wasn't her first entanglement.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-010#13:1>
'There was an earlier, uh discretion,' she coughs.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-010#14:1>
Then there's Sook Ching, 25, a public relations executive who cheated
on her boyfriend for six months with a Singapore man she met while holidaying
abroad.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-010#15:1>
She ended up marrying neither, but is now happily going out with Man
No. 3.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-010#16:1>
Lisa, a 26-year-old lawyer, picked up more than a third language at a
class she was taking.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-010#17:1>
She had been dating her boyfriend 10 months when she met her expat
lover and their affair lasted a good five months.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-010#18:1>
Question is, why do it at all?

<ICE-SIN:W2B-010#19:1>
Why string two men along, instead of making a clean break with No. 1?

<ICE-SIN:W2B-010#20:1>
The women say they were hedging their bets.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-010#21:1>
They didn't want to give up the security of having a steady boyfriend
while testing the waters with the second.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-010#22:1>
As one of them put, 'Never keep your back door closed.'

<ICE-SIN:W2B-010#23:1>
Besides, there was still genuine feeling for the first boyfriend,
which made it difficult to call quits.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-010#24:1>
All four women's boyfriends were around their age, but the 'other
men' were older from five to 15 years with cars and apartments of their own.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-010#25:1>
Two women came up with the adjective 'suave' when asked to describe
her secret lover, and all four said theirs was 'exciting'.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-010#26:1>
Surreptitious meetings, dinners in expensive restaurants - the
affairs were conducted, for most of the part, at night, and in a cloud of
secrecy.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-010#27:1>
Ellen was the only one who went out in public often movies, shopping
centres but she was careful not to be seen holding hands with him.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-010#28:1>
Real sexual intimacy took place in his apartment and a hotel in town.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-010#29:1>
Mei, constantly paranoid about bumping into her boyfriend or his
friends, made sure she always knew where he was, and avoided the places where
he hung out.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-010#30:1>
Even then, she only relaxed when she was at the other man's house, or
at his country club.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-010#31:1>
Ellen and her fiance seemed the perfect couple, envied and admired,
the ones who would move on to marriage, kids, and a golden anniversary.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-010#32:1>
Her parents approved of him.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-010#33:1>
Her friends liked him.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-010#34:1>
But after nine years together, she didn't know if she loved him.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-010#35:1>
Ellen, a high-flyer, wanted someone she could look up to.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-010#36:1>
Then along came Keith, a few years he senior, but already hugely
successful.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-010#37:1>
He was everything her fiance wasn't.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-010#38:1>
Keith was her confidante and mentor when it came to her career.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-010#39:1>
He was ruthless in business, and she found herself drawn to that
ruthlessness, ad the power that came with it.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-010#40:1>
Her fiance, an attentive, good-natured man, lacked the drive she
found so attractive in her lover.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-010#41:1>
But Keith didn't want a relationship, he wanted a fling.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-010#42:1>
She finally found the strength to call things off.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-010#43:1>
Her feelings for her fiance, dormant during the eight months, slowly
revived.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-010#44:1>
But not enough it seems.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-010#45:1>
Having had a taste of the heady, intoxicating high that came with her
affair, Ellen is now contemplating the benefits of keeping a regular
paramour.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-010#46:1>
'Put it this way.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-010#47:1>
No man is perfect.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-010#48:1>
What I found in one, I couldn't find in another.'

<ICE-SIN:W2B-010#49:1>
Not surprisingly, she's been having second thoughts about her coming
wedding.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-010#50:1>
Mei turned to Man No. 2 because she was feeling neglected.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-010#51:1>
'My boyfriend was always so bo-chap, like he didn't care, which made
me really insecure.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-010#52:1>
I felt that I loved him more than he loved me, and in some twisted
way, I wanted to hurt him back, to even the score.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-010#53:1>
I cheated on him to see if other men would find me attractive.'

<ICE-SIN:W2B-010#54:1>
During a particularly unhappy phase of her relationship, she was
introduced to her second fling at a party - a man eight years older and,
unlike her boyfriend who was just starting out in his career, willing to talk
about marriage.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-010#55:1>
He was sweet and concerned.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-010#56:1>
He did 'little things' for her that her boyfriend didn't, like
calling three times a day, and driving her to and from work.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-010#57:1>
She felt 'looked after.'

<ICE-SIN:W2B-010#58:1>
But Mei went back to her steady boyfriend because she says she never
once intended to leave him for anyone else.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-010#59:1>
Her relationship with her boyfriend has since improved, she says, in
part because she doesn't feel so dependent on him anymore, and she is
actually more confident now.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-010#60:1>
Sook Ching, the one who's now going out with Man No. 3, is a PR
executive whose delicate, pixieish countenance gives no indication of her
practical gumption.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-010#61:1>
She knew she wanted out of her relationship with her boyfriend who
was 'selfish' and had no time for her.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-010#62:1>
But she wasn't going to leave him until she had someone else.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-010#63:1>
At first she thought that someone was a fellow Singaporean she met on
holiday - an older man who knew all the right moves and had the reputation of
being a ladies' man. When they got back, they saw each other infrequently -
six times at most, always at night, always at his place.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-010#64:1>
'I tried to justify my affair by saying it could either make me
really appreciate my boyfriend, or make me realise enough how rotten he was
so that I should leave,' she tells me.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-010#65:1>
As it turned out, she did both.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-010#66:1>
She dumped No. 2 when she realised he was sleeping around, and
appreciated her boyfriend another six months - before leaving him for Man No.
3.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-010#67:1>
For Lisa, who met No. 2 at language class, having a man 15 years
older sweep her off her feet was an intense, exhilarating experience. He was
a European, working here. He dressed well, had good taste - your typical man
of the world.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-010#68:1>
Man of the world?

<ICE-SIN:W2B-010#69:1>
'He knew about wines,' she offers by way of explanation.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-010#70:1>
He asked her out with a group of friends the first time.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-010#71:1>
They had dinner, went clubbing.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-010#72:1>
Five hours later, they ditched the group and went back to his house,
where they talked all night.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-010#73:1>
They had sex on their second date.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-010#74:1>
I ask if she was in love with him.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-010#75:1>
'Of course not,' says the Heather Locklear lookalike.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-010#76:1>
'It was a form of escapism, and he offered excitement, but I still
loved my boyfriend.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-010#77:1>
It's like going to the shopping centre.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-010#78:1>
You may buy something new, but you still like the clothes you have at
home.'

<ICE-SIN:W2B-010#79:1>
She cooled things off when her expat lover started making demands on
her.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-010#80:1>
'I was talking to another man at a party once, and he got really
angry.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-010#81:1>
He said some things that made me feel cheap, and I was thinking,
'What right have you got to get mad?

<ICE-SIN:W2B-010#82:1>
Doesn't my boyfriend have more right, since I'm with you?'

<ICE-SIN:W2B-010#83:1>
And I started feeling really bad about my boyfriend.'

<ICE-SIN:W2B-010#84:1>
So she stopped seeing her second man, although they're 'still good
friends', and her relationship with her boyfriend made it through another
year.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-010#85:1>
'Women,' declares a male friend of mine, 'are better at the cheating
game.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-010#86:1>
They're more subtle, more sophisticated with this sort of thing than
men could ever be.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-010#87:1>
Men are so obvious you can tell immediately when they're lying.'

<ICE-SIN:W2B-010#88:1>
He may have a point.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-010#89:1>
After all, the four women I spoke to had never been found out by
their boyfriends.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-010#90:1>
All had two or three good girlfriends who covered up for them.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-010#91:1>
'Every time I went out with my lover I'd prep my girlfriends
beforehand on what we were supposed to be doing,' says Lisa.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-010#92:1>
For Mei, " All I had to do was call one girlfriend up and say, 'We're
watching a movie tonight', and she'd understand."

<ICE-SIN:W2B-010#93:1>
Ellen, out on a secret date once, was horrified when she bumped into
a close friend who didn't know about her affair then.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-010#94:1>
" I went up to her and said, 'Don't say anything'.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-010#95:1>
She gave me a look that reassured me, so I knew it was all right."

<ICE-SIN:W2B-010#96:1>
All the four women also let Man No. 2 know they were attached.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-010#97:1>
The logic behind this was simple: It makes things easier, for one
thing.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-010#98:1>
It's complicated enough deceiving one man, but two increases the risk
of being found out, especially in tiny Singapore.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-010#99:1>
As Ellen says, 'The other man can't get too angry with you if you
can't spend time with him.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-010#100:1>
You can always throw it back at him, and say he knew what he was in
for when he got involved.'

<ICE-SIN:W2B-010#101:1>
Apparently, in some cases, the fact that you already form a couple
with someone else makes your attractiveness increase.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-010#102:1>
these women, already above-average in looks, are a double
temptation to other men by virtue of their 'unavailability'.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-010#103:1>
'I used to think men wouldn't hit on women who were attached, but if
anything, it's an ego-booster for them if you give in,' says Ellen.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-010#104:1>
I ask if they ever felt guilty about cheating on their boyfriends.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-010#105:1>
'I didn't want to think of it as cheating, more like giving myself a
fair-chance,' Sook Ching tells me.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-010#106:1>
'I felt bad for a while about cheating, then it went away.'

<ICE-SIN:W2B-010#107:1>
At the end of the affair though, she says she felt 'used'.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-010#108:1>
She had hoped things would work out with Man No. 2, but he had
apparently been seeing several other women at the same time.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-010#109:1>
Lisa was 'regretful, in that I cheapened myself and my relationship
with my boyfriend.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-010#110:1>
But there was no right or wrong in the situation for me.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-010#111:1>
Because my feelings for my boyfriend never diminished.'

<ICE-SIN:W2B-010#112:1>
Mei says, 'Yes I felt guilty - especially when I slept with the
other man.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-010#113:1>
Which could explain why we never quite enjoyed sex.'

<ICE-SIN:W2B-010#114:1>
Were they ever tempted to confess all to their boyfriends?

<ICE-SIN:W2B-010#115:1>
'Never.'

<ICE-SIN:W2B-010#116:1>
They say it has as much to do with protecting their boyfriends as
themselves.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-010#117:1>
Three women wouldn't have been able to handle a break-up, - and they
know their boyfriends would never have forgiven them.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-010#118:1>
Ironically, though, when asked how they would feel if their
boyfriends were cheating on them, all four women came up with exactly the
same thing: I'd kill him.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-010#119:1>
The four women I spoke to may be just the tip of the iceberg.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-010#120:1>
They certainly think so.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-010#121:1>
They don't think they're representative of all women, of course, and
they're not proud of what they did.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-010#122:1>
But they do feel there are more women like them out there.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-010#123:1>
So while some might say that this goes to show how men and women
have reached true 'equality' in coupledom, perhaps they should also ask if
unfaithful women really aren't like unfaithful men after all - merely trying
to have their cake and eat it. </I>
