<h> THE NATIONAL CELEBRATIONS </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2F-016#2:1>
1990

<ICE-SIN:W2F-016#3:1>
There were at least sixty-five thousand smartly-dressed people in the
National Stadium during that epoch-making afternoon.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-016#4:1>
The sun was beginning to dip into the far horizon.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-016#5:1>
The billowy clouds in the sky had kept the temperature low which was
very much appreciated by all in the National Stadium.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-016#6:1>
" Do you really think that the PM ( referring to Prime Minister Lee
Kuan Yew) will really hand over the reins of power to Mr Goh Chok Tong
today"?

<ICE-SIN:W2F-016#7:1>
When and how the transfer of power will take place has been the topic
of much heated discussion ever since Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew had publicly
stated that he would hand over power to Mr Goh Chok Tong end of 1990.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-016#8:1>
" Today is an auspicious day".

<ICE-SIN:W2F-016#9:1>
A mature masculine voice broke out.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-016#10:1>
" Why, it is our 25th Anniversary.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-016#11:1>
I hope Mr Goh Chok Tong will become our new Prime Minister today".

<ICE-SIN:W2F-016#12:1>
Folding his hands, he looked as though he's deep in thought and
appeared very educated.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-016#13:1>
He must have thought about this matter for some time.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-016#14:1>
He seemed to have his own good reasons for making his point of view
heard.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-016#15:1>
A middle-aged woman was heard in another part of the National Stadium
when she spoke loudly ( to match her unexpectedly 'loud' dress): " Ah yah,
when is the ceremony going to start?

<ICE-SIN:W2F-016#16:1>
I've been here hours, still we are all waiting.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-016#17:1>
Waiting for what?"

<ICE-SIN:W2F-016#18:1>
She sat up straight and solemn-faced as she tried to wipe off the
perspiration from her forehead.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-016#19:1>
Those near her were unusually patient that late afternoon.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-016#20:1>
Normally, they'd have joined her in blaming the organisers if the
organisers hadn't been punctual.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-016#21:1>
It looks like Singaporeans are typically neurotic when it comes to
punctuality, save at the wedding dinner party when they observe " rubber
time" - the time that stretches like rubber.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-016#22:1>
" Today is special".

<ICE-SIN:W2F-016#23:1>
So said a young man looking relaxed.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-016#24:1>
He continued: " So, we must be patient.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-016#25:1>
After all, it's still early," he intoned, surprised to find himself
unusually patient.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-016#26:1>
Many nodded their heads in agreement.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-016#27:1>
The middle-aged woman turned a deaf ear to the young man, tilting her
chin slightly higher than the normal position.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-016#28:1>
She just looked away in another direction.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-016#29:1>
For no apparent reasons, quite spontaneously, strangers began to talk
with each other all over the National Stadium.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-016#30:1>
Maybe, it's boredom caused by waiting.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-016#31:1>
Or, maybe, it was due to the fact that they felt a need to talk.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-016#32:1>
Many of them had harboured thoughts to themselves regarding the
transfer of power.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-016#33:1>
Now they took the opportunity to verbalise them.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-016#34:1>
Naturally, not a few were just re-stating what they had heard from
colleagues and friends.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-016#35:1>
Whatever was the reason, many sensible statements were made and
shared with the newly-found friends who were, moments ago, total strangers.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-016#36:1>
" I believe Mr Goh Chok Tong will make a good successor to Prime
Minister Lee Kuan Yew," asserted a Eurasian-looking man in his late thirties.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-016#37:1>
" I've heard on the grapevine that he has many fine ideas and
programmes that he looks forward to carrying out when he becomes Prime
Minister.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-016#38:1>
Also, for quite some time now, he has gotten together a good team of
thinkers and planners who have solid ideas and plans to improve our living
and working conditions".

<ICE-SIN:W2F-016#39:1>
He spoke like someone who had access to high-level planning.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-016#40:1>
His hands were resting on his hips and his shoulders were slumped
with the weight of what he was saying, so it seemed.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-016#41:1>
" Of course, what else"?

<ICE-SIN:W2F-016#42:1>
said a middle-aged man who was carrying his umbrella.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-016#43:1>
He looked like the type of person who's ever ready for any
eventuality.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-016#44:1>
He must have been a Boy Scout who had been conditioned to live up to
the well known motto: Be prepared.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-016#45:1>
" After all, he has been well groomed by Lau Lee ( an endearing
Chinese way of addressing Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew).

<ICE-SIN:W2F-016#46:1>
You can safely assume that Lau Lee had done an excellent job".

<ICE-SIN:W2F-016#47:1>
He gave the impression that he was pontificating.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-016#48:1>
No one was to challenge his statement.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-016#49:1>
No one did, anyway.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-016#50:1>
" That aside, Mr Goh Chok Tong must be assessed on his own merit.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-016#51:1>
If he didn't have fine leadership quality he'd never have gained the
attention of the PM and the co-operation of the younger leaders".

<ICE-SIN:W2F-016#52:1>
A tall woman in her late twenties had joined in the conversation.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-016#53:1>
She's all softly-padded and Filofax in her tawny brown dress and gold
accessories, with sunglasses to protect her eyes.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-016#54:1>
The people around her were quite surprised by her statement.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-016#55:1>
She looked younger than she was.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-016#56:1>
A career woman, she has seen enough of the corporate world to know
something of power-struggles and office politics.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-016#57:1>
She was there with her fiancée who looked equally yuppie.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-016#58:1>
He's one of those passionately dressed floor-movers, sporting a
long-sleeved black tee, tight tartan pants, and maroon velvet suspenders.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-016#59:1>
His sunglasses matched hers'.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-016#60:1>
These yuppies want to look and act differently from the crowds, but
end up as drably uniform as the rest of the pack.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-016#61:1>
They can be picked up easily from any crowd.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-016#62:1>
Same attire.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-016#63:1>
Same hairdo.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-016#64:1>
Same watches and rings.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-016#65:1>
Even same smiles.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-016#66:1>
Sama, sama ( Malay for same, same).

<ICE-SIN:W2F-016#67:1>
" You, yuppies, all say the same things, lah," volunteered a youngish
man.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-016#68:1>
" Can't you be original"?

<ICE-SIN:W2F-016#69:1>
he frowned.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-016#70:1>
" We may be yuppies, but don't forget that we've both brains and
brawns," the career woman's fiancee said, coming to her rescue, clearly
irritated by the young man's rude statement which he knew was meant to be
annoying in the first place.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-016#71:1>
" My fiancee was right in affirming that Mr Goh Chok Tong had passed
all the assessments with flying colours.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-016#72:1>
The corporate world is very confident of his leadership".

<ICE-SIN:W2F-016#73:1>
He felt good to have joined in the conversation and was secretly
rejoicing over his sensible speech.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-016#74:1>
He was proud of having vindicated his fiancee.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-016#75:1>
" Ya, lah, I heard that the younger leaders are all raring to go.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-016#76:1>
They are eagerly awaiting for their turn to run our country.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-016#77:1>
That's what they say in my office".

<ICE-SIN:W2F-016#78:1>
He looked as though he had just completed his National Service
because he still cut a trim figure.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-016#79:1>
Too early in his career to get flabby because of excessive
entertainment.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-016#80:1>
This young man was putting his future on the new younger leaders to
lead Singapore through another twenty-five years of growth and prosperity.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-016#81:1>
" I wonder how the minority groups will fare in the new line-up.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-016#82:1>
Will they be given more leadership positions?

<ICE-SIN:W2F-016#83:1>
Will Chok Tong have a Malay or an Indian as the First Deputy Prime
Minister?

<ICE-SIN:W2F-016#84:1>
I'd love to know that".

<ICE-SIN:W2F-016#85:1>
This Indian man in his batik shirt was articulating the thoughts of
many Malays and Indians who have been asking this question quite anxiously.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-016#86:1>
" I noticed that you addressed Mr Goh Chok Tong as 'Chok Tong'.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-016#87:1>
Is there any reason for this"?

<ICE-SIN:W2F-016#88:1>
asked a man in his beige barong, matched by his beige sun visor.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-016#89:1>
The Indian man said quite frankly.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-016#90:1>
" I guess it's my way of respecting a man by calling him by name,"
nodding his head as he continued his short discourse.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-016#91:1>
" It is not that I know him.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-016#92:1>
It is just my way of addressing him," smiling as he tapped his
forehead in the way many Indians do.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-016#93:1>
Unknown to the Indian man, countless Singaporeans, too, have already
started to call Mr Goh Chok Tong simply as Chok Tong.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-016#94:1>
It's " Chok Tong this" and " Chok Tong that".

<ICE-SIN:W2F-016#95:1>
It has come as naturally to them as it had to their elders who
formerly had addressed Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew simply as 'Lee Kuan Yew'.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-016#96:1>
Far from being disrespectful, it's a nice and natural way for them to
address their chosen leader in that personal manner.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-016#97:1>
It's also their way of showing their respect and confidence in their
new leader.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-016#98:1>
" To change the subject, do you think that Singapore will have a
smooth sailing the next twenty-five years"?, biting his fingernails, a
nervous-looking man asked.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-016#99:1>
He's anxious to know if his future would be trouble-free.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-016#100:1>
The national economy has been quite robust the last four years,
having overcome the downward turn in 1986.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-016#101:1>
The spectre of that 1986 economic nose-dive hasn't quite
disappeared.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-016#102:1>
Retrenchment, a 15% cut of the employers' Central Provident Fund
contribution, lower wages, and difficulty in finding suitable jobs are still
fresh in the psyche of many Singaporeans.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-016#103:1>
Their leaders have marvellously turned back the tide, and now they
are basking in monetary glory once again.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-016#104:1>
The nervous-looking man wasn't alone in wishing to know if the next
twenty-five years would be trouble-free.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-016#105:1>
" Hey, man, I'm sure Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew must have mixed
feelings stepping down".

<ICE-SIN:W2F-016#106:1>
This man came prepared for the Celebrations and was properly attired
in his formal Malay dress.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-016#107:1>
Having assumed that Singapore would have another twenty-five years
of prosperity, he'd deliberately not answered the nervous-looking man's
question.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-016#108:1>
Rather, he felt justified in switching to another subject, viz.,
Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew's mixed feelings on stepping down.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-016#109:1>
He spoke each word carefully, though he gave the impression that
he's casual.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-016#110:1>
" I believe you were right.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-016#111:1>
Not just mixed feelings.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-016#112:1>
It must be very difficult for him to step down too.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-016#113:1>
Especially when he knows that there are still many people who would
want him to stay on.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-016#114:1>
Of course, there are people who just can't wait to see him go.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-016#115:1>
All the same, the majority of Singaporeans would want him to
continue.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-016#116:1>
I believe you will see that sentiment today.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-016#117:1>
Just wait and see.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-016#118:1>
The people here will show him that they do really want him to stay
on".

<ICE-SIN:W2F-016#119:1>
For a young woman, she spoke with authority and conviction.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-016#120:1>
Surprisingly, too.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-016#121:1>
After all, one'd have thought that the young would prefer to see
Chok Tong in total control.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-016#122:1>
" I was just thinking," butted in another woman, " if Mr Lee Kuan
Yew would feel sorry leaving his seat of power.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-016#123:1>
After all, he's been in command for the last thirty-one years.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-016#124:1>
Any human being would feel the loss of power in such a situation.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-016#125:1>
With the loss of power would be the loss of identity, one way or
another.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-016#126:1>
More than that, what would he do with his free time?

<ICE-SIN:W2F-016#127:1>
I know that he's going to be around, but it won't be the same as
before".

<ICE-SIN:W2F-016#128:1>
" Yah, lah, it will be difficult for him.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-016#129:1>
Poor soul.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-016#130:1>
If he helped too much, people will criticise him.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-016#131:1>
If he didn't help enough, people will also sabo ( local slang to
mean 'sabotage' or 'undermine' in a critical way) him".

<ICE-SIN:W2F-016#132:1>
A young lad in his late teens, sitting at the second level of the
staircase, had decided to join in.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-016#133:1>
He shook his head slowly and said: " Poor man, lah.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-016#134:1>
Only lose, no win".

<ICE-SIN:W2F-016#135:1>
This young lad might not be able to articulate his thoughts
carefully, but he wasn't ready to lose out by not making his contribution.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-016#136:1>
" Chok Tong won't find his task easy-going, either.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-016#137:1>
Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew isn't going to be the only person who
will find the transition tough.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-016#138:1>
Chok Tong will find and experience similar problems.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-016#139:1>
For example, if he didn't consult his former boss and things go
wrong, people will blame him.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-016#140:1>
If he consulted him too often, people will say that he's not his own
boss.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-016#141:1>
Like the Americans used to say: You're damned if you do; you're
damned if you don't.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-016#142:1>
It's a no-win situation for both leaders".

<ICE-SIN:W2F-016#143:1>
An old man who had kept quiet all along, at long last had said what
many thinking people have been saying quietly in their heart.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-016#144:1>
It is quite apparent that informed Singaporeans must have been doing
a great deal of thinking aloud.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-016#145:1>
Judging from the kind of statements just mentioned, almost the whole
of Singapore's population must have gone through some anxious moments during
this period of transition.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-016#146:1>
This seems to be confirmed by what's heard and said by Singaporeans.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-016#147:1>
" I'm 100% sure that Chok Tong will doubt, if he hasn't already
doubted, if he can succeed Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew successfully. <X>

<ICE-SIN:W2F-016#X148:1>
Any person will tell you that succeeding the PM is truly a hard act
to follow.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-016#X149:1>
The PM's shadow will be hovering over Chok Tong all the time,
obviously or not obviously.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-016#X150:1>
Even if the PM said nothing after stepping down, everyone can still
hear him, one way or another. </X> </I>
