<ICE-SIN:S2A-070#1:1:A>
May it please you my Lord

<ICE-SIN:S2A-070#2:1:A>
I appear together with my learned colleague Mister Loh Chai Chong
for the Plaintiffs and my learned friend Mister Isaac Nathan together with
Mister Brown appear for the Defendants my Lord

<ICE-SIN:S2A-070#3:1:A>
My Lord we are grateful for your Lordship for having given us
granted us the indulgence to start this case a little late primarily because
we wanted to get some primary documents from the Police officer concerned

<ICE-SIN:S2A-070#4:1:A>
Now he has arrived and he has given part of the documents but he
hasn't got a complete list

<ICE-SIN:S2A-070#5:1:A>
So he's trying to locate the other part now

<ICE-SIN:S2A-070#6:1:A>
But in any event for present purposes I think I'll put him in the
witness-box at the appropriate stage and introduce his evidence and then
perhaps later on he can come back and let us have the remaining documents my
Lord

<ICE-SIN:S2A-070#7:1:A>
My Lord the issues in this case are fairly straightforward whether
of fact or of the law

<ICE-SIN:S2A-070#8:1:A>
The Plaintiffs' claim is really for the value of certain Caterpillar
spare parts that were stolen by a conspiracy of two of their employees and
two other persons from the outside

<ICE-SIN:S2A-070#9:1:A>
The conspirators finally sold all the stolen goods that will be our
case to the Defendants

<ICE-SIN:S2A-070#10:1:A>
And the Defendants themselves and that will appear from the various
documents in the bundle or documents my Lord sold to unknown third parties
some of those parts which were stolen

<ICE-SIN:S2A-070#11:1:A>
The last instalment which was stolen was recovered by the Police
who were alerted by the Plaintiffs and they laid a trap and caught the
culprits red-handed and that last instalment valued at about one hundred and
sixty thousand dollars was recovered by the Police and returned to the
Plaintiffs

<ICE-SIN:S2A-070#12:1:A>
It will be the evidence of the Plaintiffs my Lord that the total
value of the lost articles is approximately five hundred thousand Singapore
dollars and we will lead evidence as to how we arrived at that figure and
alternatively damages

<ICE-SIN:S2A-070#13:1:A>
So the issues are fairly short and they are as follow my Lord

<ICE-SIN:S2A-070#14:1:A>
Firstly in purchasing the stolen articles from the conspirators and
subsequently disposing of them if the Defendants converted those goods

<ICE-SIN:S2A-070#15:1:A>
That's the first issue in law

<ICE-SIN:S2A-070#16:1:A>
Were the goods converted by the Defendants

<ICE-SIN:S2A-070#17:1:A>
If so what were the value of those goods

<ICE-SIN:S2A-070#18:1:A>
Now going through my learned friend's bundle of authorities last
night my Lord we noticed that they are going to run a defence of
purchase-in-the-market goods

<ICE-SIN:S2A-070#19:1:A>
Now we have ourselves gone to the point and my learned colleague
Mister Loh Chai Chong has done some work and he would like to make his
submissions on the law on that point my Lord with your Lordship's permission

<ICE-SIN:S2A-070#20:1:A>
Now if I may at this stage just introduce the bundle of documents

<ICE-SIN:S2A-070#21:1:A>
The first one is the bundle of pleadings my Lord which consist of
the statement of claim and the defence

<ICE-SIN:S2A-070#22:1:A>
Has your Lordship got it <X>

<ICE-SIN:S2A-070#X23:1:A>
Plaintiffs' bundle of documents Volume One </X>

<ICE-SIN:S2A-070#24:1:A>
No my Lord it's on the pleadings my Lord bundle of documents lodged
pursuant to Order thirty-four Rule three point six

<ICE-SIN:S2A-070#25:1:A>
That's the one yes

<ICE-SIN:S2A-070#26:1:A>
That consists of the statement of claim which is in very short form
and the defence my Lord which is also in relatively short form

<ICE-SIN:S2A-070#27:1:A>
Before I deal with the statement of claim my Lord I'll deal with
I'll introduce the other bundle of documents as well

<ICE-SIN:S2A-070#28:1:A>
We have two Plaintiffs' bundle of documents in two volumes Volume
One and Volume Two <X>

<ICE-SIN:S2A-070#X29:1:A>
Volume Two is described as supplementary bundle </X>

<ICE-SIN:S2A-070#30:1:A>
That's right my Lord bundle of documents Volume Two

<ICE-SIN:S2A-070#31:1:A>
Now my learned friend has got two documents Defendants' bundle of
documents Volume One and Volume Two

<ICE-SIN:S2A-070#32:1:A>
Now quite a few of the important documents are repeated in both
bundles in other words Plaintiffs' bundle as well as the Defendants' bundle
my Lord

<ICE-SIN:S2A-070#33:1:A>
And at some stage both my learned friend and myself we'll get
together for the purposes of agreeing so that we can have one common bundle
as an agreed bundle

<ICE-SIN:S2A-070#34:1:A>
For the time being my Lord he says that he wants to preserve his
position as to the relevance of some of the documents in my bundle anyway

<ICE-SIN:S2A-070#35:1:A>
Now the Plaintiffs' Volume Two supplementary bundle is not agreed
my Lord

<ICE-SIN:S2A-070#36:1:A>
My learned friend says that he's going to object to it depending on
the use that I'm going to put that document to that's right isn't it <X>

<ICE-SIN:S2A-070#X37:1:A>
That's the computer thing I refer to my Lord </X>

<ICE-SIN:S2A-070#38:1:A>
That's right

<ICE-SIN:S2A-070#39:1:A>
So we won't be marking these bundles at this stage my Lord

<ICE-SIN:S2A-070#40:1:A>
Thank you very much

<ICE-SIN:S2A-070#41:1:A>
So going back to the bundle of pleadings your Lordship sees in
paragraph two

<ICE-SIN:S2A-070#42:1:A>
It's been asserted that the Plaintiffs were the owners and entitled
to possession of the Caterpillar spare parts to the value of five hundred
thousand dollars and that from the period January nineteen eight-three to
September nineteen eighty-three at fourteen Tractor Road Singapore the said
Caterpillar spare parts and other spare parts to the value of five hundred
thousand dollars were stolen from the Plaintiffs' warehouse by Mohamed Taz
Khan Ramachandra Ng Kin Sai and Madam Liau Pau

<ICE-SIN:S2A-070#43:1:A>
All the said stolen Caterpillar spare parts of the said value of
five hundred thousand dollars were old and delivered by the above-named
Mohamed Taz Khan Ramachandra Ng Kin Sai and Liau Pau Min to the Defendants
during the said period from January nineteen eighty-three to September
nineteen eighty-three

<ICE-SIN:S2A-070#44:1:A>
The Defendants then being in possession of the said stolen
Caterpillar spare parts have sold pledged delivered and/or otherwise dealt
with or disposed of the said Caterpillar spare parts to a person or persons
unknown without the Plaintiffs' consent express or implied whereby the
Plaintiffs suffered loss and damages

<ICE-SIN:S2A-070#45:1:A>
And they claim five hundred thousand dollars my Lord

<ICE-SIN:S2A-070#46:1:A>
My Lord the defence is interesting

<ICE-SIN:S2A-070#47:1:A>
Paragraph one the Defendants deny receiving the said stolen
Caterpillar spare parts

<ICE-SIN:S2A-070#48:1:A>
They do not admit what's alleged in paragraphs two and thirty of
the statement of claim and in paragraph three they want to say as follows

<ICE-SIN:S2A-070#49:1:A>
At all material times the Defendants' purchased they say in the
ordinary course of business certain Caterpillar spare parts from foreign
companies situated in the United States of America Europe and Japan and the
local spare parts dealer namely Uniborn Enterprise Company then having its
registered office at Number thirty-five Kallang Pudding Road etcetera
Singapore

<ICE-SIN:S2A-070#50:1:A>
The Defendants bought the aforesaid spare parts in good faith and
without notice of any defects or want of title on the part of Uniborn
Enterprise Company and paid a reasonable market price for the said goods

<ICE-SIN:S2A-070#51:1:A>
Now we asked for further and better particulars my Lord of these
allegations and we have them my Lord in a separate document

<ICE-SIN:S2A-070#52:1:A>
My Lord before I deal with the particulars further and better
particulars can I ask your Lordship to have a look at page forty-five on the
Volume One of the Plaintiffs' bundle of documents my Lord forty-four

<ICE-SIN:S2A-070#53:1:A>
It's a copy of our letter of second October nineteen eighty-six
addressed to my learned friend's firm in which we say we refer to your
client's defence filed and served on the Plaintiffs of thirteenth August

<ICE-SIN:S2A-070#54:1:A>
Having examined the defence we are satisfied that our clients the
Plaintiffs in the above Suit are entitled to the following further and better
particulars of the defence of the suit

<ICE-SIN:S2A-070#55:1:A>
Under paragraph three on the allegation made by your clients that
at all material times the Defendants purchased in the ordinary course of
business certain Caterpillar parts etcetera kindly give full particulars of
the alleged purchase of the Caterpillar spare parts from such foreign
companies and local spare part dealers especially Uniborn Enterprise Company
as follows and there we set it out my Lord paragraph one

<ICE-SIN:S2A-070#56:1:A>
Paragraph two please state from whom in particular these alleged
purchases were so made and whether they were oral or written and if written
identifying the document or all documents in which these alleged purchases
were in point

<ICE-SIN:S2A-070#57:1:A>
Three please state whether these alleged purchases were paid for
and if so paid for whether in cash by cheques or any other form of payment
and four please state to which person or particular persons in such company
or companies such payments were so made

<ICE-SIN:S2A-070#58:1:A>
The answer to that letter my Lord appears on the next page page
forty-six

<ICE-SIN:S2A-070#59:1:A>
It says we are instructed that our clients are long established as
dealers of spare parts and have been purchasing spare parts over a long
period of time from companies situated in the United States of America Europe
and Japan

<ICE-SIN:S2A-070#60:1:A>
The identities of suppliers of these parts we are instructed cannot
be disclosed at this stage as it may be prejudicial to our clients

<ICE-SIN:S2A-070#61:1:A>
Our clients consider this information as confidential and we
therefore regret that our clients cannot accede to your clients request

<ICE-SIN:S2A-070#62:1:A>
We then made applications of court and obtained necessary orders my
Lord and the next stage in these proceedings appears on page fifty of that
bundle

<ICE-SIN:S2A-070#63:1:A>
It's our letter of the sixth of March eighty-seven to my learned
friend's firm

<ICE-SIN:S2A-070#64:1:A>
We refer to the further and better particulars of the defence dated
thirteenth August nineteen eighty-six filed and served by you pursuant to the
order of court dated fifth January eighty-seven and to the answers given to
request one two three and four thereof which our clients feel are inadequate
as follows

<ICE-SIN:S2A-070#65:1:A>
In respect of Items A to F in the Defendants answer to request
number one the Defendants have not disclosed the type of Caterpillar spare
parts giving the part numbers and amounts in respect of each of such parts
allegedly sold to the Defendants

<ICE-SIN:S2A-070#66:1:A>
In respect of Defendants' answer to request number two therein the
Defendants have not given the name of the person from whom the Defendants had
made these alleged purchases

<ICE-SIN:S2A-070#67:1:A>
It is clear from the request that the Plaintiffs want the name of
the person from whom the alleged purchases were made as it is very clear from
the Order made by the Honourable Chief Justice on the fifth of January
nineteen eighty-seven that all the requests in the further and better
particulars relate to Uniborn Enterprise Company

<ICE-SIN:S2A-070#68:1:A>
In respect of the Defendants' answer to request number three the
Defendants have failed to answer whether the cheques were cash bearer or
crossed cheques

<ICE-SIN:S2A-070#69:1:A>
In respect of the Defendants' answer to request number four the
Defendants have failed to answer to which person or particular persons
Uniborn Enterprise Company such payments were so made

<ICE-SIN:S2A-070#70:1:A>
And we asked for those further particulars

<ICE-SIN:S2A-070#71:1:A>
And what appears my Lord in that document that I handed over a few
minutes ago are the further particulars that were submitted and this is what
they say the answer under paragraph one my Lord appears on page two

<ICE-SIN:S2A-070#72:1:A>
The Caterpillar spare parts bought by the Defendants were bought in
lots without identification of part numbers and amounts of each of the parts

<ICE-SIN:S2A-070#73:1:A>
As the same were mixed with the existing and newly purchased parts
from various overseas suppliers the identity of these parts cannot be
obtained by the Defendants

<ICE-SIN:S2A-070#74:1:A>
Under paragraph two the answer is the Defendants made the purchases
from a person by the name of Albert and who claimed to be the boss of Uniborn
Enterprise

<ICE-SIN:S2A-070#75:1:A>
Under paragraph three my Lord the answer is to the best of the
Defendants' knowledge the following purchases were made by the Defendants in
the manner provided hereunder and they give particulars of the cheques that
were allegedly issued by the Defendants to Albert it will appear later is
Mister Ng Kin Sai of the conspirators my Lord

<ICE-SIN:S2A-070#76:1:A>
The other relevant documents that I would like to refer your
Lordship to in the bundle of documents are as follows my Lord

<ICE-SIN:S2A-070#77:1:A>
I think I'll start off with my learned friend's bundle and that's
Volume Two of the Defendants' bundle of documents my Lord

<ICE-SIN:S2A-070#78:1:A>
The very first letter on page eight Volume One my Lord Defendants'
bundle of documents

<ICE-SIN:S2A-070#79:1:A>
Page eight my Lord it's a letter of fourteenth November nineteen
eighty-three written by my learned friend's office to affirm to the
officer-in-charge Jurong Police Station in which they say my Lord that we
understand that your officers have arrested one Mister Lim Chee Teck

<ICE-SIN:S2A-070#80:1:A>
I believe he's one of my learned friend's witnesses under section
four hundred and eleven chapter one hundred and three for the purchase of
certain spare parts and have released him on a bond pending further
investigations </I>
