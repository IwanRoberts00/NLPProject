<h> Bodies and Non Bodies: Narrativity in Lin Hsin Hsin's Recent Works
</h>

<ICE-SIN:W2D-019#2:1>
In my introductory remarks to Lin Hsin Hsin's works of time ( 1991)
which constituted the principal theme of her last exhibition, I made passing
mention of Lessing, implying that discussion of time in art have to square up
to him.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-019#3:1>
On reviewing those remarks I regret that I not provide sufficient
airing of Lessing's notions on that subject, and remained content with a
cryptic reference.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-019#4:1>
Lin's present works and the focus of my interpretation of them permit
me to redress that neglect; in dealing with Lessing's thesis Lin's
productions can be seen in a wide historical field.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-019#5:1>
My concern here is with narrativity, it is an interest that has
hovered at the edges of Lin's painting practice, occasionally streaming
towards and occupying the central arena of her pictures.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-019#6:1>
I believe there has now emerged a sustained and serious attempt by Lin
to explore the realm of pictorial narrative; her pre-occupation can
especially be discerned in small pictures executed in oil on paper.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-019#7:1>
In entering into this genre, she has moved into a context which has
been dominant in art history until the advent of modernism; narrativity,
however, has re-emerged with particular force in contemporary practices, and
with it has also surfaced interest in representation.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-019#8:1>
Narrativity and representation have given rise to complex practices
and works involving space, time and bodies.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-019#9:1>
Space, time and bodies are the constituent components of Lessing's
thesis and it will be useful to briefly review his position and then proceed
towards a discussion of Lin's present productions.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-019#10:1>
Lessing distinguished the arts of space from those of time; he was
prompted to do so as he probed into the deep structures of the Laoc group; in
doing so he proposed a thesis concerning narrative in visual arts, and
particularly in painting.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-019#11:1>
Recently the implication of Lessing's advances have been viewed
dubiously and in some quarters met with incredulity; nevertheless, his
notions have settled to form part of the grounds for art historical and
critical practices.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-019#12:1>
Painting and poetry, according to Lessing, employ wholly different
signs; whereas the former utilises forms and colours in space, the latter is
made up of sounds in time.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-019#13:1>
Space and time are the distinguishing, defining dimensions in which
these arts assume their distinctive identities and characteristics.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-019#14:1>
Even as they are distinctive, Lessing takes care to resist attempts
to make then exclusive to one another; he is equally sensitive to the
limitations of both the arts of space and of time.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-019#15:1>
It is in these contexts that he offers his most compelling
observations.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-019#16:1>
Forms and colours in space area, in Lessing's eyes, analogous to
bodies.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-019#17:1>
Objects which exist side by side, or whose parts so exist, are called
bodies.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-019#18:1>
Consequently bodies with visible properties are the peculiar subjects
of painting.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-019#19:1>
A little further on in his diagnosis he adds: All bodies, however,
exist not only in space, but also in time; painting can intimate, even
exemplify time but only as it is suggested through forms.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-019#20:1>
How is this manifested?

<ICE-SIN:W2D-019#21:1>
The apprehension of time is possible through varying appearances of
bodies; each single appearance is the outcome of a preceding one and is the
cause of a following one; each appearance also projects a single moment of an
action and embodies the centre of a present action.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-019#22:1>
Having advanced his thesis to this position Lessing proclaims the
formative criteria of painting: as the painter can use but one moment at any
given occasion, ie a single body cast in one appearance, it is vital that the
most important one be selected; this is the most pregnant one - one most
suggestive of what has gone before and what is to follow.' These conclusions
entail a number of assumptions; I will highlight three of them.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-019#23:1>
Firstly, the bodies referred to by Lessing are incarnated as human
forms or figures; they are inflamed with purpose, identity, consciousness and
are highly articulated.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-019#24:1>
Action is equated with the human figure in motion; indeed, the figure
in its entirety is a repertoire of gestures.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-019#25:1>
Secondly, the arrangement and action of these bodies require space
which is ample and correspondingly articulated; the spatialization envisaged
by Lessing is akin to that of a theatrical stage.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-019#26:1>
Bearing in mind Lessing's twin interests in Homer and the Lacoon,
this analogy is not surprising; painting is theatrical action realised in
pictorial terms.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-019#27:1>
Thirdly, the content or subject matter of painting is firmly rooted
in literature; the human figure, acting and moving in space, assumes its
identity, purpose and habitat from settled and stable iconographies.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-019#28:1>
Again recalling Lessing's interests, the shaping, sustaining force of
iconographies is epic literature in which time and space are sequential and
homogenous, while bodies and actions are continuous and harmonious.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-019#29:1>
The dynamics of pictorial narrative and representation have largely
been determined by these conceptions - that is, until the emergence of
modernism.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-019#30:1>
Representation and especially narrativity have been largely
marginalised, even suppressed in the dominant critical accounts of modern
art; they were believed to be antithetical to such vaunted ideals as flatness
of the picture surface and purity of the medium which are upheld as intrinsic
qualities of painting and therefore its true criteria.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-019#31:1>
Recently, critical enterprises have proceeded along radically
different lines; the situation has shifted away from such reductive, hermetic
positions and moved towards expansive, multifaceted approaches.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-019#32:1>
In this respect, some most trenchant discourses have emerged from new
readings of productions such as Velazquez's Las Meninas ( 1656) and Manet's
0lympia ( 1863); these works have proved to be fertile sites for cultivating
new, complex ways of constructing the dynamics of pictorial structures, which
include modes of representation and narrativity.2 It is apparent that
Lessing's norms do not prevail.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-019#33:1>
It is no longer possible to project world views along continuous,
smoothly-gliding tracks; neither is it feasible to construct reality by means
of homogenous entities or with entities which while being contiguous are not
harmoniously connected.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-019#34:1>
Be that as it may, and more than ever, space, time and bodies are
still among the constituting components of artsitic structures.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-019#35:1>
How are they utilised by Lin Hsin Hsin?

<ICE-SIN:W2D-019#36:1>
How do they come together in order to suggest narrative conditions?

<ICE-SIN:W2D-019#37:1>
The word is integral to Lin's cone of vision; however her entry into
and involvement in the realm of words is appraised, there is little doubt
words are formative, shaping mechanism for her.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-019#38:1>
Emotions, perceptions, reflections and sensations are nailed down and
given concrete presences by the word.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-019#39:1>
For this occasion she has composed Back to Nature and casts it in the
form of a splintering narrative which also acts as a compendium for her
visual creations.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-019#40:1>
The kernel of many of her pictures is contained in her poem; pictures
emanate from that poem.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-019#41:1>
Back To Nature satirises the urban dweller; wishing to escape from it
all, he retreats to the country and having got there is not able to discard
the trappings of a city person.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-019#42:1>
Still, there are many wondrous encounters, each tumbling upon the
other, dispersing in a number of directions; however, these lead to the
unremitting realisation that after all he's really an intruder/ he's out of
focus!

<ICE-SIN:W2D-019#43:1>
But he is unfazed; being and outsider has the advantage of being
unfettered and that smells like freedom and success.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-019#44:1>
And so, he is ready for takeoff.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-019#45:1>
Let me move on to the pictures.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-019#46:1>
In discussing them I will focus on those executed in oil on paper for
it is in these that Lin has moved to fresh grounds.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-019#47:1>
They are the outcome of her engagement with narrative modes, which
are distinctive and articulated.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-019#48:1>
The events and actions embodied in these pictures are invented and
constructed by Lin; they arise from her observations of the foibles of her
fellow human beings; it is important to underline the sense of fellowship.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-019#49:1>
She is undeniably sympathetic towards the conditions of man; every
event, every situation, every encounter wells up from an undiminished spring
of empathy.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-019#50:1>
Lin also cherishes nature.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-019#51:1>
Her approach to her fellow man, while forthright, is also indulgent;
her belief in nature is unshakable.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-019#52:1>
Not surprisingly her pictures project a consoling, warm aura.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-019#53:1>
The bodies that articulate her narratives are in part invented and
spawned by her imagination and in part extracted from the world as it is
experienced.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-019#54:1>
The frog, turtle, bird and fish-like creatures are amongst the
preferred entities; the human figure appears once in its entirety; also
featured are sea and landscape features which do not merely act as props but
are vital players in the narrative.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-019#55:1>
In a few compositions, Lin introduces wiry, figure-like form's, who
appear to be pirouetting and careening at great speeds; these figures are
sheer magic as they are conjured by deftly manipulating linear brushed
elements which twirl around one another and settle into suggestive,
anthropomorphic presences.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-019#56:1>
Any discussion of Lin's painting practice and her artistic ideology
will have to deal with her utilisation of the medium; she employs oil in a
distinct and marked way, almost dissembling its conventional character; the
effects of her approach determine her construction of pictorial narrative 3.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-019#57:1>
Lin radically alters the very nature of oil; she is not concerned
with its opulence, density, body or tactile qualities.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-019#58:1>
On the contrary, she suppresses such ostensive appeals for which oil
is renown and for which it has been cultivated over the past five centuries.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-019#59:1>
Lin brushes oil on to surfaces as washes and as finely modulated
brush marks; she renders oil as a translucent membrane, through which light
and textures percolate and radiate; Whereas artists customarily revel in and
cultivate the substantial properties of oil, Lin transforms the medium into
insubstantial characteristics and conditions.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-019#60:1>
Translucency and fluidity are the hallmarks of Lin's manipulation of
oil; her pictures project delicacy pushed to the edge of self-effacement, and
at times lean towards the borders of indeterminacy.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-019#61:1>
The effects of these on space, time and body are considerable.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-019#62:1>
Pictures titled those were the days and great minds think alike serve
to introduce Lin's narrative world; in them she unveils the ambience of the
principal characters and the nature of events and actions.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-019#63:1>
The bodies, while legible enough, are modestly formed; their presence
is not marked by physical gravity and by casting dense shadows but by
alertness which is elastic and kinetic.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-019#64:1>
Note for instance the althleticism exemplified by the turtles in
those were the days and its kinship with the figures in great minds think
alike.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-019#65:1>
In these two pictures, clearly marked horizons designate firm
terrestrial basis; further up the picture surface, stains, dots and dashes of
pigment signify an enlivened firmament, possessing its own vivacity and not
necessarily related to the event or action as such.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-019#66:1>
While Lin's form language is highly idiosyncratic, she employs it
consistently.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-019#67:1>
Fitness program and in search of excellence testify to this.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-019#68:1>
The turtle is familiar enough; the real in the articulated knot of
lines which simulates a figure.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-019#69:1>
In fitness program, the figure is borne aloft, taking with it a puff
of earth, with its legs and hands spread-eagled.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-019#70:1>
It is an electrifying vision.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-019#71:1>
Lin also employs letters adroitly, pressing them to divulge both
semantic and pictorial meanings.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-019#72:1>
In search of excellence marks a dramatic departure from established
compositional schemas; by and large Lin favours a horizontal ground which
appears explicitly and on occasions implicitly congealed in the middle or
lower middle sector of he picture surface; here the picture plane is tilted
precipitously upwards and at an acute gradient.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-019#73:1>
The ground beneath the turtle and the figure scream away at great
speed and the two bodies appear to be suspended over the movement.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-019#74:1>
Wittily and pungently Lin points to the ultimate source of
excellence: solar illumination and energy!

<ICE-SIN:W2D-019#75:1>
It is in conversation a la carte, curtains up, do not disturb,
football unmatched and shadow boxing that Lin reaches accomplished heights in
the present exhibition.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-019#76:1>
All the bodies and pictures are articulated in their entirety; they
connect with one another through gestures, glances and bodily attitudes and
yet retain their respective spaces and presences.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-019#77:1>
They do not require delineated spaces in an architectonic sense they
define their spatiality through their actions and the created occasion
sufficiently, and without ostentation. <X>

<ICE-SIN:W2D-019#X78:1>
The translucent rendering of the medium imbues these pictures with a
sense of transitoriness ; time is not made concrete; or is it frozen by
grand, theatrical gestures.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-019#X79:1>
Time is fluid, flowing and elusive; the bodies constituting the
narratives congeal momentarily in order to convey an action or event and then
threaten to re-integrate into the flux of the medium and to become bodiless.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-019#X80:1>
Space, time and bodies approach the condition of being erased.
