<ICE-SIN:S1B-060#2:1:A>
Item number two Mr Charles Charles Chong

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-060#3:1:B>
Uh Mr Chairman Sir

<ICE-SIN:S1B-060#4:1:B>
I beg to move the sum to be allocated for Head I be reduced by ten
dollars in respect of Code I A fifteen hundred of the main estimates

<ICE-SIN:S1B-060#5:1:B>
Sir I note the Minister for Communications on the twentieth of
February this year released figures to indicate that our sea-port is the
world's number one three times over

<ICE-SIN:S1B-060#6:1:B>
The figures announced by the Minister showed that the PAS was the
world's number one container port

<ICE-SIN:S1B-060#7:1:B>
and according to the Minister Singapore is also number one in terms
of gross registered shipping tonnage

<ICE-SIN:S1B-060#8:1:B>
and yet again number one in terms of the number of vessel movements

<ICE-SIN:S1B-060#9:1:B>
Uh Sir we just heard the Minister remind the House a few moments ago
that Changi airport is also number one in the world

<ICE-SIN:S1B-060#10:1:B>
I would like to ask the Minister how important or necessary is our
current obsession with the number one position

<ICE-SIN:S1B-060#11:1:B>
Uh Sir I do not think many Singaporeans would dispute the fact that
in order to survive and to prosper we need to constantly strive to be better

<ICE-SIN:S1B-060#12:1:B>
However this obsession with the number one position in some cases
may be completely unnecessary

<ICE-SIN:S1B-060#13:1:B>
For example being number one for rules regulations and fines is
definitely unnecessary

<ICE-SIN:S1B-060#14:1:B>
In other cases being number one may just not be good enough

<ICE-SIN:S1B-060#15:1:B>
Now although the Singapore worker's been rated number one in the
world for more than a decade it does not mean that we have arrived

<ICE-SIN:S1B-060#16:1:B>
In fact there are still many areas that must be improved as pointed
by by an honourable friend Dr Ow Ching Hock a few days ago in this House

<ICE-SIN:S1B-060#17:1:B>
Now Sir if in striving to be the best we can be takes us to the top
position should we not enjoy being number one in the world a little more
modestly and quietly

<ICE-SIN:S1B-060#18:1:B>
Now blowing our own trumpet whenever any survey no matter how in
insignificant it rates us as being number one in the world may not have very
many beneficial effects

<ICE-SIN:S1B-060#19:1:B>
It may mistakenly convey the impression on our people that we are
already the best that we can be

<ICE-SIN:S1B-060#20:1:B>
However more significantly it may make us more prominent targets
for protectionist measures taken by the less competitive and the more envious
who may perceive us to be bigger competitors than what we actually are

<ICE-SIN:S1B-060#21:1:B>
Now perhaps the Minister could give us his views on this subject

<ICE-SIN:S1B-060#22:1:B>
Uh Mr Chairman Sir with your kind permission could I now take my
second cut

<ICE-SIN:S1B-060#23:1:B>
However before speaking on Singapore's air services agreements I
would like to declare my special interest in this subject as an employee of
Singapore airlines

<ICE-SIN:S1B-060#24:1:B>
Sir in the re in recently concluded air services agreements with
other countries we appear to be giving away more liberal traffic rights to
other carriers than what we receive for Singapore carriers

<ICE-SIN:S1B-060#25:1:B>
It also appears that despite this very liberal air policy
Singapore's carriers still face apparent protectionist measures taken by
other countries

<ICE-SIN:S1B-060#26:1:B>
Now could the Minister comment this issue and let us know what
advantage our liberal air policy has on air carriers in Singapore and also on
the country as a whole

<ICE-SIN:S1B-060#27:1:B>
Sir I beg to move

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-060#28:1:A>
The question is that the sum to be allocated for H I to be
reduced by ten dollars in respect of Code 1 A fifteen hundred of the main
estimates

<ICE-SIN:S1B-060#29:1:A>
Mr Mah

<ICE-SIN:S1B-060#30:1:A>
Sorry Mr Harun Ghani

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-060#31:1:A>
You can take both cuts

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-060#32:1:C>
Okay thank you

<ICE-SIN:S1B-060#33:1:C>
When Telecom introduced new pricing system for charging usage of
telephone our level of society felt that the action caused inconvenience to
public

<ICE-SIN:S1B-060#34:1:C>
Sir your Ministry of Communications became a target for this
unhappiness

<ICE-SIN:S1B-060#35:1:C>
However through the survey conducted in December ninety one
received seventy three percent of the users would bear lesser than before

<ICE-SIN:S1B-060#36:1:C>
This relieved the public and less unhappiness heard

<ICE-SIN:S1B-060#37:1:C>
Sir indirectly Telecom has succeed into getting the public to be
thirsty

<ICE-SIN:S1B-060#38:1:C>
My compliments to Minister of Telecommunications

<ICE-SIN:S1B-060#39:1:C>
Further to this I would like to know the information pertaining to
the public usage of telephone in months of January and February this year

<ICE-SIN:S1B-060#40:1:C>
If it is invariable with the finding in December and feedback
received than the public will more relieved

<ICE-SIN:S1B-060#41:1:C>
Sir time-based price system indirectly may reduce the profit or may
not be profitable to Telecom

<ICE-SIN:S1B-060#42:1:C>
Therefore how Telecom to reconcile reduction in revenue earned with
expansion planned by employing high-technology

<ICE-SIN:S1B-060#43:1:C>
Sir it seem that there is one more point which cause unhappiness to
factory employees who are using office telephones

<ICE-SIN:S1B-060#44:1:C>
Those who work in factory will not be allowed uh able to use office
telephone

<ICE-SIN:S1B-060#45:1:C>
It would be better if Telecom provide card telephone in factory
office so that it can be used by the employees

<ICE-SIN:S1B-060#46:1:C>
I raise this point because there are factories which want to
install card telephone but was rejected by Telecom

<ICE-SIN:S1B-060#47:1:C>
Second cut Sir

<ICE-SIN:S1B-060#48:1:C>
Permission

<ICE-SIN:S1B-060#49:1:C>
This year Telecom is entering privatization and definitely it will
provide big program which requires high-technology equipment and services

<ICE-SIN:S1B-060#50:1:C>
Beside large amount of investment required services of skill level
will also play an important role in the excellent services provide by Telecom

<ICE-SIN:S1B-060#51:1:C>
In view of this will the employee be given skilled training or
whether they have been trained and ready to excel in providing such services
in future

<ICE-SIN:S1B-060#52:1:C>
What about those who are not able to adjust themselves to rapid
expansion of Telecom especially long service employees

<ICE-SIN:S1B-060#53:1:C>
Either their services are no longer required or they've been
transferred to do tasks which different from their usual job

<ICE-SIN:S1B-060#54:1:C>
and if their services are no longer required what sort of
compensation will Telecom provide for them

<ICE-SIN:S1B-060#55:1:C>
Sir Telecom intention to sell share to public as uh I think the the
DPM already mentioned will not uh uh the idea

<ICE-SIN:S1B-060#56:1:C>
Indeed it's appropriate move and shall be commended

<ICE-SIN:S1B-060#57:1:C>
My sincere is dead his employee should be given priority in
purchasing the share through CPF saving or as to boost the morale of the
employees

<ICE-SIN:S1B-060#58:1:C>
I'm saying this not because my wife is working with Telecom

<ICE-SIN:S1B-060#59:1:C>
It is just coincidence

<ICE-SIN:S1B-060#60:1:C>
For those who do not have CPF saving this is the time for them to
start saving and learn to be for the future and old age

<ICE-SIN:S1B-060#61:1:C>
Sir my hope my hope is that if Telecom want to reap large profit
through privatization and increase capital expenditure on high technology and
equipment the burden of bearing the high cost should not be shifted to
consumers only

<ICE-SIN:S1B-060#62:1:C>
Thank you Sir

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-060#63:1:A>
Mr Mah

<$D> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-060#64:1:D>
Mr Chairman Sir Mr Charles Chong asked why we are so obsessed
with always being the best in the world

<ICE-SIN:S1B-060#65:1:D>
Sir it is my fervent belief that we must maintain this obsession
and I use the word obsession without apology

<ICE-SIN:S1B-060#66:1:D>
Sir maintaining a number one position for us is not an end in
itself but a means to an end

<ICE-SIN:S1B-060#67:1:D>
If I can use our sea-port as an example why do we push and why do
we strive to keep the port of Singapore a number one container port a number
one port in terms of shipping and so on

<ICE-SIN:S1B-060#68:1:D>
Sir to remain the number one port is not just a matter of
collecting accolades which all Singaporeans can be proud of

<ICE-SIN:S1B-060#69:1:D>
Sure we are proud to be the number one port in the world

<ICE-SIN:S1B-060#70:1:D>
But more importantly is that with this achievement comes not only
pride but also very very tangible benefits

<ICE-SIN:S1B-060#71:1:D>
Economically the port creates jobs and it creates wealth for our
people

<ICE-SIN:S1B-060#72:1:D>
There're seven thousand workers directly employed by the PAS
there're another thirty eight thousand employed in industries which are
related to the port

<ICE-SIN:S1B-060#73:1:D>
Last year or in nineteen ninety the PAS contributed something like
two percent to the national wealth

<ICE-SIN:S1B-060#74:1:D>
And if we add the port-related industries warehousing ship-
etcetera the contribution rises to something like three to four percent of
the national wealth

<ICE-SIN:S1B-060#75:1:D>
So this is something like one quarter of the transport and
communications sector's contribution to the national economy

<ICE-SIN:S1B-060#76:1:D>
So it's not just not not just a matter of being number one for its
own sake but striving to be the best

<ICE-SIN:S1B-060#77:1:D>
And in the process finding that we are the best in the world we are
number one in the world and trying to maintain that position

<ICE-SIN:S1B-060#78:1:D>
There is no reason for us to feel apologetic about it

<ICE-SIN:S1B-060#79:1:D>
I think if we can do it we should continue to try for it

<ICE-SIN:S1B-060#80:1:D>
But I have to add that this is not going to be plain-sailing

<ICE-SIN:S1B-060#81:1:D>
There're other ports that are coming up in the region

<ICE-SIN:S1B-060#82:1:D>
They are also believe it or not trying to number one

<ICE-SIN:S1B-060#83:1:D>
They've all upgraded their facilities in the last few years in
terms of the kind of business that the port of Singapore carries out

<ICE-SIN:S1B-060#84:1:D>
We have to continue to make sure that we are more cost-competitive
than them

<ICE-SIN:S1B-060#85:1:D>
We are more efficient and we provide the best supporting services

<ICE-SIN:S1B-060#86:1:D>
If we can continue to do this we will continue to remain as the
number one port in the in the region and in the world and we continue to reap
the benefits

<ICE-SIN:S1B-060#87:1:D>
Sir the government is aware that the PAS must have the necessary
support particularly in the area of port capacity

<ICE-SIN:S1B-060#88:1:D>
We must be able to provide sufficient capacity to handle the amount
of cargo that is to come our way

<ICE-SIN:S1B-060#89:1:D>
So PAS is now working closely with relevant government agencies to
plan a new container port which will meet the needs of Singapore beyond the
century and keep us as number one

<ICE-SIN:S1B-060#90:1:D>
Sir Mr Charles Chong also asked about our uh liberal open skies
policy

<ICE-SIN:S1B-060#91:1:D>
I think it is a well-known fact that we have consistently adopted
such a policy

<ICE-SIN:S1B-060#92:1:D>
Basically what it means is that while we negotiate air rights on a
bilateral basis with different countries we want to have as many of these
bilateral agreements as possible

<ICE-SIN:S1B-060#93:1:D>
Once such an agreement is concluded we allow the other countries
airline to fly to Singapore even if our national carrier has no immediate
plans to fly to that country

<ICE-SIN:S1B-060#94:1:D>
Now why do we do this

<ICE-SIN:S1B-060#95:1:D>
The reason is very simple

<ICE-SIN:S1B-060#96:1:D>
It brings us many benefits

<ICE-SIN:S1B-060#97:1:D>
It enhances tourism visitors from all parts of the world can get in
and out of Singapore quickly and conveniently encourages investment it
benefits trade and most of all consumers will benefit from a wider choice of
airlines and more convenient itineraries

<ICE-SIN:S1B-060#98:1:D>
Now I sometimes like to think of our airport as a huge bus
interchange with flights coming in and out at such frequent intervals that
sometimes people would rather come to Singapore catch a flight and then go on
to their final destination destination rather than go directly because it is
faster and sometimes it's even cheaper to do it the this way

<ICE-SIN:S1B-060#99:1:D>
So while we continue to adopt this open skies policy I must mention
the fact that it does not mean that Singapore is prepared to give away more
than what we actually receive

<ICE-SIN:S1B-060#100:1:D>
And in this respect whenever we have an air services negotiation
it is the overall package of exchange that must be an equitable one

<ICE-SIN:S1B-060#101:1:D>
and when I say equitable I'm talking about there being a balance
of opportunities

<ICE-SIN:S1B-060#102:1:D>
Not a balance of benefit but a balance of opportunities for both
sides

<ICE-SIN:S1B-060#103:1:D>
And the reason why we ask for a balance of opportunities is simply
because we know that under such a situation we can compete with the best in
the world

<ICE-SIN:S1B-060#104:1:D>
Sir I turn to Harun Ghani's points

<ICE-SIN:S1B-060#105:1:D>
I thank him for his concern that uh Singapore Telecom's profit
will be reduced because of introduction of time-based charges

<ICE-SIN:S1B-060#106:1:D>
I he asked for some statistics latest statistics on telephone
usage under the time-based charge

<ICE-SIN:S1B-060#107:1:D>
If I may present this Sir

<ICE-SIN:S1B-060#108:1:D>
In January nineteen ninety two that is uh January this year under
the flat under the flat rate system

<ICE-SIN:S1B-060#109:1:D>
Sir sorry sixty nine percent of the people paid less under the
time-based charge than under the flat rate system <X>

<ICE-SIN:S1B-060#X110:1:D>
So sixty nine people benefited from this conversion to the
time-based charge The corresponding figure for February ninety two the last
month was seventy two percent the figure for December ninety one which was
the first month that the time-based charging system went into operation was
very close to this seventy three percent So more or less around the same
figure In fact Singapore Telecom collected less revenue from point six
million dollars less in the three months December to February ninety two
compared to what it would have collected under the old system Sir Singapore
Telecom as I've stated is in the process now of reviewing this time-based
charging system and all the views and options that have been expressed will
be taken into account in this review and an announcement of the outcome will
be made in due course Sir when Singapore Telecom is privatized uh TS will be
reconstituted as a stat board and uh the activities of Singapore Telecom will
be overseen by this stat board Uh I wish to assure the member that uh the
interest of consumers will be safeguarded under the new situation when there
is a separate statutory board On the point about unhappiness of private
factory employees not being allowed to use the phones uh I'm sure Telecom
will be pleased to install uh additional coin uh phones for them if they wish
to do so Uh I think I've addressed the points that have been raised Mr
Speaker: Charles Chong Mr Charles Chong: Uh Sir I thank the Minister for his
answers and I beg leave to withdraw my amendment Mr Speaker: Member given
leave to withdraw his amendment Amendment withdrawn </X> </I>
