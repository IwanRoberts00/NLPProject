<ICE-SIN:S1B-053#X1:1> Live from Parliament 11 March '92 Wednesday </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-053#2:1:A>
withdraw his amendment <unclear> word </unclear>

<ICE-SIN:S1B-053#3:1:A>
Amendment number two thirty minutes Mr Chng

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-053#4:1:B>
Mr Chairman Sir I beg to move that the sum to be allocated for
head to be reduced by ten dollars in respect of code fifteen hundred of the
main estimates

<ICE-SIN:S1B-053#5:1:B>
Sir my subject is uh fixing of airline fares

<ICE-SIN:S1B-053#6:1:B>
Sometime last year about twenty airlines which fixes air fares in
Singapore in a cartel called the Intra-Marketing Program collapsed in the
process

<ICE-SIN:S1B-053#7:1:B>
uh air fares to London were literally halved what it was

<ICE-SIN:S1B-053#8:1:B>
But for the last several years in nineteen uh eighty nine there was
a different program called market development program which again form a
similar airlines uh to regulate set minimum prices for air fares

<ICE-SIN:S1B-053#9:1:B>
All this fixing of air fares out of Singapore is to the disadvantage
of the consumers the Singaporeans especially

<ICE-SIN:S1B-053#10:1:B>
This fixing of air fares leads to ridiculous <unclear> word
</unclear> whereby it's cheaper for Malaysians to travel from Kuala Lumpur to
Singapore and to London than for Singaporeans to travel from Singapore to
London

<ICE-SIN:S1B-053#11:1:B>
All because of price fixing in Singapore

<ICE-SIN:S1B-053#12:1:B>
Sir I don't think this uh switching is tenable

<ICE-SIN:S1B-053#13:1:B>
I believe that the Minister should do something about it

<ICE-SIN:S1B-053#14:1:B>
Perhaps let me quote what he said in uh fifteen of January nineteen
ninety in reply to question on deregulation of uh the oil prices

<ICE-SIN:S1B-053#15:1:B>
Uh may I quote from <unclear> word </unclear>

<ICE-SIN:S1B-053#16:1:B>
Sir He said at that time

<ICE-SIN:S1B-053#17:1:B>
Deregulation encourages competition among oil companies

<ICE-SIN:S1B-053#18:1:B>
It forces them to operate efficiently and to be more responsive to
the needs of the consumers

<ICE-SIN:S1B-053#19:1:B>
It allows the free market to determine the real price for the
product

<ICE-SIN:S1B-053#20:1:B>
and it's therefore fair and economically rational

<ICE-SIN:S1B-053#21:1:B>
The government does not regulate the prices of food transportation
or other basic necessities in Singapore

<ICE-SIN:S1B-053#22:1:B>
the competition to bring down prices and prevent profiteering

<ICE-SIN:S1B-053#23:1:B>
So my question to the Minister is that this fixing of airline fares
has been going on for a long time to the disadvantage of consumers

<ICE-SIN:S1B-053#24:1:B>
and my uh particular question is also a general one is if in the
event whereby a fixed number of suppliers of goods comes together fixed
prices to the disadvantage of consumers

<ICE-SIN:S1B-053#25:1:B>
like if oil companies come together to fix all the prices what will
be the Ministry's stand whether he will apply administrative pressure or will
he move a bill in Parliament to prevent this happening Sir

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-053#26:1:A>
Question is that the sum could be allocated for head or now
head could be reduced by ten dollars in respect of code a fifteen hundred of
the main estimates Mr Khoo

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-053#27:1:C>
Mr Chairman Sir I'll like to declare my interest

<ICE-SIN:S1B-053#28:1:C>
I'm a staff at the uh NTU with the views I express today will be
entirely be mine

<ICE-SIN:S1B-053#29:1:C>
Sir the government has already committed to giving more money for R
& D eventually up to one percent of GDP and and uh in the near future up to
five percent of GDP

<ICE-SIN:S1B-053#30:1:C>
This money can be a force for jacking up productivity or it may be
so much money down the drain

<ICE-SIN:S1B-053#31:1:C>
How to measure success and failure in R & D is very subjective

<ICE-SIN:S1B-053#32:1:C>
Let me draw two parallels across the Pacific IBM in America and
Sony in Japan

<ICE-SIN:S1B-053#33:1:C>
Both companies are renowned for their industrial prowess

<ICE-SIN:S1B-053#34:1:C>
Their empires stand the globe and their names are synonymous with
creativity inventiveness and profitability until lately of course

<ICE-SIN:S1B-053#35:1:C>
Last year IBM lost money

<ICE-SIN:S1B-053#36:1:C>
The ideas and products did not set the world on fire

<ICE-SIN:S1B-053#37:1:C>
Often they lost to products and ideas coming out from the American
research backyards

<ICE-SIN:S1B-053#38:1:C>
And then in spite the fact that Big Blue spent US six billion
dollars for R & D about fourteen percent of Singapore's GDP

<ICE-SIN:S1B-053#39:1:C>
I repeat fourteen percent of Singapore's GDP and that on one item
mainly uh infotech

<ICE-SIN:S1B-053#40:1:C>
Can we spend one percent of our GDP and hope to succeed in
everything from biomedical technology to engineering to botany chemistry

<ICE-SIN:S1B-053#41:1:C>
I think we must find uh some market niches and not spread our
resources too thinly

<ICE-SIN:S1B-053#42:1:C>
But I want to ask the people question Is IBM's R & D achievement a
success or a failure

<ICE-SIN:S1B-053#43:1:C>
Some would say that it is a resounding success

<ICE-SIN:S1B-053#44:1:C>
Look at the results

<ICE-SIN:S1B-053#45:1:C>
In the eighties IBM won won two Nobel Prize winners

<ICE-SIN:S1B-053#46:1:C>
She has filed over thirty three thousand patents and her
researchers have published thousand and thousands of academically acclaimed
and cited academic papers

<ICE-SIN:S1B-053#47:1:C>
Along the corridors of their research lab hundreds of hi-tech
wizards are peering the telescopes looking for tomorrow's solution apparently
forgetting today's needs

<ICE-SIN:S1B-053#48:1:C>
Sir can we afford the ideal model

<ICE-SIN:S1B-053#49:1:C>
If we cannot I'll be looking elsewhere

<ICE-SIN:S1B-053#50:1:C>
I suggest if we're looking elsewhere we look at Japan's Sony the
world's most inventive and creative company

<ICE-SIN:S1B-053#51:1:C>
How they do R & D and how they motivate their R & D staff should be
an inspiration for Singapore for three reasons

<ICE-SIN:S1B-053#52:1:C>
First their R & D is market-driven and success means the ability to
translate an idea into commercial success

<ICE-SIN:S1B-053#53:1:C>
in other words there's a return on investment

<ICE-SIN:S1B-053#54:1:C>
Second the technology level in Singapore is closer to to Sony's
than to IBM's

<ICE-SIN:S1B-053#55:1:C>
And third to me the most important their expenditure Sony's
expenditure in R & D is something we can achieve

<ICE-SIN:S1B-053#56:1:C>
Last year Sony spent one point five billion US dollars five point
seven percent of their revenue were about three point five percent of our GDP
Singapore's GDP

<ICE-SIN:S1B-053#57:1:C>
Those figures are realistic for us

<ICE-SIN:S1B-053#58:1:C>
Within a short term reach of Singapore's R & D plan Sony's re
achievement is remarkable Fortune magazine calls Sony's R & D engineers the
world's most prolific and innovative

<ICE-SIN:S1B-053#59:1:C>
Everyday they turn out four new products

<ICE-SIN:S1B-053#60:1:C>
Sir I think there's a lesson in Sony's R & D that we can learn and
that the best auditing tool for R & D lies in the market

<ICE-SIN:S1B-053#61:1:C>
That's why Sony succeeds and IBM hasn't succeeded so well I wonder
if the Minister for Trade and Industry agrees

<ICE-SIN:S1B-053#62:1:C>
Thank you

<ICE-SIN:S1B-053#64:1:D>
Mr Chairman Sir my subject is measures to check inflation

<ICE-SIN:S1B-053#65:1:D>
Mr Chairman Sir workers are generally very anxious about increases
in cost of living

<ICE-SIN:S1B-053#66:1:D>
Uh stated in the Economic Survey of Singapore nineteen ninety one
most of the inflation in nineteen ninety one was due to domestic factors

<ICE-SIN:S1B-053#67:1:D>
Unlike external factors which are beyond our control government can
work out an interim measure to check domestic sources of inflation and
particularly profiteering

<ICE-SIN:S1B-053#68:1:D>
I would like to ask the Minister to outline what measures his
Ministry has to check the rise in the cost of living

<ICE-SIN:S1B-053#69:1:D>
Sir although our inflation rate is low compared to other countries
our current rate is high compared to the average rate for the last five years

<ICE-SIN:S1B-053#70:1:D>
We saw low rates of inflation in nineteen eighty seven to eighty
nine

<ICE-SIN:S1B-053#71:1:D>
Many increases which led to high inflation in nineteen ninety one
were introduced in nineteen ninety

<ICE-SIN:S1B-053#72:1:D>
For example the increase increases in the cost of transport MRT
fares bus fares and so on

<ICE-SIN:S1B-053#73:1:D>
And for nineteen ninety two there are new levies

<ICE-SIN:S1B-053#74:1:D>
I think members of the House have uh mentioned many of these new
levies

<ICE-SIN:S1B-053#75:1:D>
Now there is also this increase in the water conservation tax on
domestic and domestic customers

<ICE-SIN:S1B-053#76:1:D>
Have we considered how much it will add to inflation

<ICE-SIN:S1B-053#77:1:D>
After all we use water for most daily and many products also use
water

<ICE-SIN:S1B-053#78:1:D>
Sir I agree that uh we must do all we can to discourage high and
wasteful consumption We import our water

<ICE-SIN:S1B-053#79:1:D>
However instead of a tax which increase or which can lead to an
increase in cost we should consider incentives like a rebate for those who
reduce water consumption

<ICE-SIN:S1B-053#80:1:D>
Sir urgent measures are necessary to monitor and check inflation
and especially to counter profiteering

<ICE-SIN:S1B-053#81:1:D>
The Minister has just stated that uh we must moderate demands on
wages and I think uh stability in cost of living can help to do this

<ICE-SIN:S1B-053#82:1:D>
Thank you

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-053#83:1:A>
Mr Leong

<$E> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-053#84:1:E>
Mr Chairman Sir I've only one card this time

<ICE-SIN:S1B-053#85:1:E>
It's good Sir for last two years every year Incik Othman Harun
Yusof and myself speak on this subject

<ICE-SIN:S1B-053#86:1:E>
thereby I think it's my duty to speak on it again

<ICE-SIN:S1B-053#87:1:E>
Now inflation in nineteen ninety one Sir last year according to the
Consumer Price Index was three point five percent

<ICE-SIN:S1B-053#88:1:E>
The Minister for Finance has mentioned yesterday that the strong
Sing dollar has helped to check inflation

<ICE-SIN:S1B-053#89:1:E>
Sir the fear of an inflationary trend as Incik Othman has said is
always in the minds of the people

<ICE-SIN:S1B-053#90:1:E>
Just today you read the papers in the Business Times in the back
page of the Business Times the Bank of Tokyo has predicted that for Singapore
our inflation will achieve growth this year to three point nine percent and
then in nineteen ninety three would be four point five percent

<ICE-SIN:S1B-053#91:1:E>
While we may not want to believe all these forecasts of economic
doom and failures I think it's useful for our Minister of Trade Industry to
actually be mindful of inflationary pressures that I'll like to ask again
this question this year

<ICE-SIN:S1B-053#92:1:E>
What measures is the Ministry taking to check inflation

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-053#93:1:A>
Incik Yatiman

<$F> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-053#94:1:F>
Mr Chairman Sir Singapore's economy had long been known as one
that is closely related to trading and services

<ICE-SIN:S1B-053#95:1:F>
Industrialisation and manufacturing expansion were made after
separation in nineteen sixty five Further development in the sector was made
much later further development in service sector was made much later

<ICE-SIN:S1B-053#96:1:F>
Sir compared to other industrialised countries in Europe America
and Japan Singapore has extremely short period for development of our local
enterprise Our initial objective of overcoming massive unemployment and
attracting investment had resulted with special emphasis given to the MNCs
and foreign investors

<ICE-SIN:S1B-053#97:1:F>
Our desire to globalise had resulted with further infusion of
capital from big business and manufacturing corporation

<ICE-SIN:S1B-053#98:1:F>
thus providing highly paid and also highly skilled oriented jobs to
our population

<ICE-SIN:S1B-053#99:1:F>
Apart from this we also have government related companies in which
the Minister had kindly touched earlier which are involved in a number of uh
manufacturing and service activities

<ICE-SIN:S1B-053#100:1:F>
Sir despite the existence of this rather harsh environment we have
seen the emergence of small and medium enterprises which are beginning to
globalise their operation

<ICE-SIN:S1B-053#101:1:F>
In this respect I wish to thank the Minister of Finance yesterday
for his very elaborate answer on various incentive given to our local SMEs
Sir the question of promoting our local enterprise

<ICE-SIN:S1B-053#102:1:F>
It was raised again and again in this House

<ICE-SIN:S1B-053#103:1:F>
We are happy that the government had looked into this matter
seriously

<ICE-SIN:S1B-053#104:1:F>
Dr Goh Keng Swee the founder of ADB had this to say

<ICE-SIN:S1B-053#105:1:F>
business people do not embark on new ventures for political
objective

<ICE-SIN:S1B-053#106:1:F>
They do so on a calculation of profits and we want to introduce
them to develop new industrial enterprises

<ICE-SIN:S1B-053#107:1:F>
we must make the economic setting suitable for the promotion of
this activity

<ICE-SIN:S1B-053#108:1:F>
That was in nineteen sixty one

<ICE-SIN:S1B-053#109:1:F>
Now the EDB annual report stated that there are three thousand
international and over seventy thousand local enterprises have set their
businesses here

<ICE-SIN:S1B-053#110:1:F>
It is also important to note that during the same period the South
Korean embarked on different part of development following the Japanese

<ICE-SIN:S1B-053#111:1:F>
They encouraged the agglomeration of local enterprises provided
financial backing and called in the expert to build their local giant
enterprises

<ICE-SIN:S1B-053#112:1:F>
These are the enterprises together with their smaller feeder
support enterprises that are seen expanding their operation abroad

<ICE-SIN:S1B-053#113:1:F>
We on the other hand invited the MNCs improve our economic
infrastructures and set up a number of government-owned or government-linked
corporations

<ICE-SIN:S1B-053#114:1:F>
In view of the above Sir

<ICE-SIN:S1B-053#115:1:F>
apart from the measures and facilities mentioned by the Minister
of Finance the step by step privatisation of our stat board mentioned by MPI
what are the other plans and measures the MPI has in mind to encourage the
growth of our local enterprise

<ICE-SIN:S1B-053#116:1:F>
Thank you Sir

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-053#117:1:A>
Order

<$E> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-053#118:1:E>
Resumption of the Committee of Supply on the estimates of
expenditure for the financial year first April nineteen ninety two to thirty
first March nineteen ninety three <X>

<ICE-SIN:S1B-053#X119:1:E>
Mr Speaker Head w Ministry of Trade and Industry amendment number
two the question is that the sum to be allocated for head w be reduced by ten
dollars in respect of code w a fifteen hundred of the main estimates General
Lee Mr Lim Boon Heng: Mr Chairman Sir Mr Yatiman Yusof has uh asked about our
strategy for developing local businesses He pointed the difference between
South Korea and Singapore Well there are significant differences between
Korea and Singapore Firstly South Korea has a population of forty three
million which is fourteen times that of Singapore They also have a land area
one hundred and fifty times ours Their large domestic market provide the
opportunity for the development of sizeable indigenous companies which can
take advantage of their economies of scale Singapore on the other hand with a
small population has had to look overseas for investors in the first step of
our industrialisation We brought in foreign capital and multinational
companies that have world class technology and know-how and the linkages with
foreign markets where they export to And Singapore has benefited from the
participation of multinational companies in our economic development Our
local industries have benefitted from the technological transfers new markets
and business partnerships with them As far as the local businesses are
concerned the array of uh existing schemes have already been uh repeated many
times so I will just like to stress one particular initiative and that is the
formation of linkages or economic groupings Here we encourage our local uh
SMEs to form linkages with multinational companies and with the
government-linked companies for mutual benefit So this I hope will be taken
up by the small and medium sized enterprises I would like to conclude by
pointing out that our small and medium sized enterprises have not been doing
too badly Since nineteen eighty six their value added per worker in
manufacturing has improved by about nine percent a year which is better than
the industry average of seven percent So by making use of the many existing
schemes available to them and by linking up with the SMEs and GLCs our local
firms can hope to maintain and improve their performance </X> </I>
