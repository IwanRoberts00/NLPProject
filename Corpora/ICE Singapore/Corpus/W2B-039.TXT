<h> New tools drive client/server boom </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-039#2:1>
Users are turning to software tools to develop client/server
applications which is seeing rapid growth from now until 1996

<ICE-SIN:W2B-039#3:1>
by Abdul Rahman b Mohd Said

<ICE-SIN:W2B-039#4:1>
Forrester Research estimates sales of client/server software and
related services to hit US&dollar;4.7 billion ( S&dollar;7.1 billion) this year, up from
US&dollar;2.5 billion in 1992.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-039#5:1>
By 1996, client/server software and services will account for 20
percent of a US&dollar;100 billion international software industry.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-039#6:1>
The Gartner Group predicted that new multi-user online applications
using a client/server architecture will account for 75 percent and 90 percent
total applications developed by 1996 and 2000 respectively.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-039#7:1>
But it also warns that only 5 percent of current is development staff
have the skills to develop cooperative type applications.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-039#8:1>
This will create a serious anomaly: whereas demand for client/server
applications will boom in the next few years, the capability to develop such
applications will be severely limited.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-039#9:1>
Using off-the-shelf client/server packages may help lighten this
problem, but packages generally do not meet the user requirements.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-039#10:1>
Custom mission critical applications are often needed by
organisations to gain a competitive edge.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-039#11:1>
Expertise is needed as client/server applications become complex.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-039#12:1>
They tend to be split, with different parts of the program resting in
different computers and each performing a differing part of the processing.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-039#13:1>
Yet they all have to work together as one.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-039#14:1>
Some of the common client/server development tools tend to provide
users with an easy to use interface to extract data from the server.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-039#15:1>
But client/server development must be seen as an enterprise-wide
effort.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-039#16:1>
Development must be coordinated between departments to prevent any
integration problems.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-039#17:1>
The solution to enterprise-wide client/server development can be
found in the tools now being used to develop mainframe type solutions.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-039#18:1>
Integrated CASE ( Computer Aided Software Engineering) tools such as
Texas Instruments' Information Engineering Facility ( IEF) and Oracle's
Cooperative Development Environment ( CDE) are designed to automate the
entire software development life-cycle.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-039#19:1>
Both have grown from the mainframe computing model, and now support
the split processing required in client/server environments.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-039#20:1>
Although integrated CASE has faced some resistance because of the
discipline and methodology it imposes upon software developers, this is
precisely what is needed for an enterprise-wide development effort.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-039#21:1>
" Client/server developments in an organisation can easily become
uncoordinated, unless developers enforce strict rules on the definitions and
relationships between different data groups," says Mr Teng Cheng Chong,
General Manager ( Asia) for TI's Advanced Information Management ( AIM)
Division.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-039#22:1>
The heart of the integrated case approach lies in the concept of the
shared repository around which different processes of the development life
cycle - - software planning, analysis, design and code generation - -
revolve.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-039#23:1>
The repository also helps increase developer productivity by allowing
common program components and objects to be shared and reused.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-039#24:1>
Developing client/server applications requires the program to be
split and run across different hardware platforms.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-039#25:1>
By breaking up the application into its data, logic and presentation
components, it can be deployed at both the client ( workstation) and servers
to be processed separately but cooperatively.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-039#26:1>
The various components can then communicate with one another
transparently across different hardware platforms.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-039#27:1>
Best of all, these tools support a wide range of client, server, and
communications systems so that users can mix and match their hardware.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-039#28:1>
They need not learn the specifics of each database or communication
protocol as the Case tools will integrate these for them. </I>

<h> New modes of working </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-039#30:2>
Sharing processing tasks in client/server models have resulted in
users finding new ways of working more productively

<ICE-SIN:W2B-039#31:2>
by Abdul Rahman b Mohd Said

<ICE-SIN:W2B-039#32:2>
Client/server computing is not the be-all and end-all of computing.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-039#33:2>
Even as the desktop and server computers begin to work cooperatively,
sharing the processing tasks, this new mode is spawning other new forms of
getting information across the organisation.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-039#34:2>
Much of the " split personality" of a client/server system comes from
a set of functions contained in popular relational databases such as Oracle,
Sybase and Informix.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-039#35:2>
Features such as remote procedure calls and triggers enable a user
using his terminal to issue a command to the database which then
independently executes the procedures and sends back the results to the user.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-039#36:2>
Many organisations maintain separate databases, either on a
departmental or regional level.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-039#37:2>
But distributed processing cannot support split processing on
multiple servers at the same time without complex programming.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-039#38:2>
All this changed in 1992, when Oracle launched what it called the
first cooperative-server database in its Oracle7 product.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-039#39:2>
A cooperative-server database hides the complexity of a computer
network by allowing applications to access data located on multiple computers
just as if all the data were stored on a single computer.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-039#40:2>
In this way, a cooperative-server database simplifies application
building and improves decisions by making access to information easier.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-039#41:2>
Many experts agree that the distributed database model is the
ultimate form of client/server computing.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-039#42:2>
Users can extract the latest information from across the
organisation, integrate it and make more meaningful analyses.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-039#43:2>
Another rapidly emerging trend is to embed a new technology called
workflow automation into a client/server application.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-039#44:2>
Workflow simply means getting the computer to pass information from
one person in a work chain to another.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-039#45:2>
For example, approvals for loan applications which involve a chain of
people checking on information, risks and other issues.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-039#46:2>
It takes as long as two weeks to complete the process manually
whereas on the computer - - with embedded workflow - it takes only two to
three hours to process the application.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-039#47:2>
According to a leading US research and analysis company, The Meta
Group, embedded workflow will be the norm in client/server offerings in the
next two years.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-039#48:2>
Leading the pack are companies like Computron and Dun & Bradstreet
Software.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-039#49:2>
One key element of workflow automation is the intelligent agent or
software robot which can filter and route information.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-039#50:2>
For example, you can program the agent to read your electronic mail
and automatically reroute the messages to wherever you are.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-039#51:2>
You can also instruct the agent to arrange your messages according to
a set of priorities that you define.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-039#52:2>
Any user of electronic mail will appreciate this, as it saves a lot
of time wading through the messages. </I>

<h> Less fuss at NUS </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-039#54:3>
Subject registration at NUS is now easier because of a
client/server-based registration system

<ICE-SIN:W2B-039#55:3>
By Kevin Lim

<ICE-SIN:W2B-039#56:3>
First year students at five National University of Singapore
faculties chose their subjects via computer when they were admitted this
year, thanks to a software developed by the NUS Computer Centre.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-039#57:3>
Based on a client/server model, the new subject registration provides
students with a " one-stop shopping destination" and reduces time spent on
queuing and applying separately for each subject.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-039#58:3>
The new system was introduced to tie in with the modular system
adopted by the Arts and Social Sciences, Business Administration, Building
and Estate Management, Engineering, and Science Faculties.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-039#59:3>
Over 4000 students were affected.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-039#60:3>
A trial involving Business Admin students was carried out a year
earlier.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-039#61:3>
Mrs Wong Ai Luen, deputy-director of NUS' Computer Centre and Head of
its Planning Services Unit, said the Centre chose client-server, primarily
because it had to design an easy-to-use graphical user interface for
registration.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-039#62:3>
This was necessary as earlier surveys had indicated that about half
the incoming students were computer-literate.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-039#63:3>
" NUS wants to take advantage of the full power of the PC and
Windows.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-039#64:3>
We wanted to use colourful screens which host-based mainframe
systems have difficulty providing," she said.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-039#65:3>
The Computer Centre developed its subject registration system using
Oracle's relational database and development tools and an IBM RS/6000 Unix
server.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-039#66:3>
The project stretched over several months and also involved the
Registrar's Office, Centre for Education Technology, Estate Office, and the
NUS Student's Union.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-039#67:3>
The registration for the Science and Arts faculties took place at the
gym where 40 of NUS' mostly Digital PCs were transported to, while students
in the other faculties registered for subjects at their respective faculties'
computer rooms.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-039#68:3>
NUS made separate arrangements for Arts and Science because they were
the biggest faculties with intakes of about l,500 students each.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-039#69:3>
The introduction of the modular system - which allows students to
choose which courses they want to take during each semester, as well as
during a special term if they wish to graduate earlier made registration more
difficult.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-039#70:3>
Citing the Arts Faculty as an example, Mrs Wong said the manual
process was tedious since the faculty's 12 departments offered a wide choice
of subjects.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-039#71:3>
In addition, there are four special programmes like European Studies
and Mass Communications which students can opt for.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-039#72:3>
First-year Arts students must select three subjects comprising two
units each.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-039#73:3>
In most cases, they had to do one of the two units in the first
semester and the second in the second semester.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-039#74:3>
But now that computers are being used for the first time, Arts can
key in their choices within 10 minutes instead of applying for each unit one
at a time over a one to two week period.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-039#75:3>
For Science students, the system works even better since they will
know straight away whether or not they have been allocated the subject, since
the faculty's policy is to let students study what they want as long as they
meet the prerequisites.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-039#76:3>
There is also an additional facility in the registration process for
Science students in that the PC will display only those major subjects which
the student can apply for, based on his " A" level results.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-039#77:3>
The Computer Centre developed different registration procedures for
different students using the same client/server system, owing to the diverse
needs of the five faculties.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-039#78:3>
Describing how the system works, Mrs Wong said that a student will
have to key in his matriculation number and smart card pin number to enter
the system.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-039#79:3>
The system then displays his name and the course he is pursuing.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-039#80:3>
From here, the student selects his choice of major subjects and the
units he wants to pursue.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-039#81:3>
The system will prompt the student when he keys in too many or too
few options or when he is expected to sign up for a compulsory unit.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-039#82:3>
Mrs Wong said NUS will extend its computerised subject registration
system to include undergraduates in their second, third and fourth years when
the next academic year begins in July next year, as this is in line with NUS'
computerisation plans and Singapore's IT2000 goals. </I>

<h> Hybrid Cars: What a Gas </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-039#85:4>
by Leow Ju-Len

<ICE-SIN:W2B-039#86:4>
It is no joke.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-039#87:4>
The future of motoring is in alternative fuel technologies.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-039#88:4>
This week, we take a peek at what drives Toyota's Prius and other
green cars.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-039#89:4>
Tomorrow's car is here - today.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-039#90:4>
The Toyota Prius is the world's first petrol-electric hybrid car to
be rolled out for sale.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-039#91:4>
It runs on two power systems - a 1.5-litre petrol engine or an
electric motor, or both at once.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-039#92:4>
The result: It can double the distance you could get out of a full
tank of petrol with a comparable car.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-039#93:4>
With an outstanding fuel economy rating of 28 km per litre and a
50-litre petrol capacity, the Prius can travel an amazing 1,400 km between
fill-ups.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-039#94:4>
With that sort of efficiency, the average Singaporean driver, who
covers 20,000 km annually, would in theory need to fill up the tank just 14
times a year.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-039#95:4>
But it has more tricks up its sleeve.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-039#96:4>
It also emits only half the carbon-dioxide emissions of a comparable
car and its toxic emissions are just 10 per cent of Japan's legal limits.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-039#97:4>
Plus, it seats five comfortably and has a proper boot that will
swallow luggage or golf bags easily.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-039#98:4>
In fact, its tall design means that although it is the same size as a
Corona on the outside, its interior volume matches that of the larger Camry.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-039#99:4>
What makes its efficiency possible is the Toyota Hybrid System (
THS).

<ICE-SIN:W2B-039#100:4>
This complex arrangement of several key components work in concert
to drive the car in various modes ( see graphic) to cut fuel consumption.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-039#101:4>
The heart of the system is the Prius' engine, a low-revving,
low-friction 1.5-litre petrol four cylinder.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-039#102:4>
It develops just 58 bhp, but is tuned for optimum fuel efficiency
rather than power.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-039#103:4>
Other key components include a 41-bhp electric motor, which
supplements the engine; a sealed nickel-metal hydride battery; an on-board
generator that tops up the batteries; a water-cooled AC/DC inverter; and an
ingenious power-split device which takes the place of a conventional
transmission. <X>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-039#X104:4>
The latter is able to vary the amount of engine power used to drive
the car or charge the batteries, or it can combine the driving force from
both the engine and motor when extra performance is required. </X> </I>
