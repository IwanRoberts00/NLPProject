<h> Nation-Building in Singapore: An Historical Perspective </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-011#3:1>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-011#4:1>
<h> SINGAPORE IN THE 19TH CENTURY </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-011#5:1>
Singapore is a small island in the Malay archipelago.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-011#6:1>
It is situated at the southern tip of the peninsula of West Malaysia,
to which it is linked by a short causeway.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-011#7:1>
When Stamford Raffles landed on the island in 1819, there were only
about 120 Malay and 30 Chinese inhabitants.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-011#8:1>
He colonized the island and established it as a free port in order to
promote trade.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-011#9:1>
Soon Chinese from the southern provinces of China, Indians, Pakistanis
and Ceylonese ( Sri Lankans) from the Indian subcontinent and Ceylon ( Sri
Lanka), and Malays from the surrounding Malay archipelago flocked here and
the population grew rapidly.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-011#10:1>
By 1836 the Chinese population had grown to 13,700 and outnumbered
the Malay population of 12,500.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-011#11:1>
In 1860 the Chinese recognizably became the majority group in
Singapore as they constituted 61% of the population.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-011#12:1>
In mid-1989 the population of 2.685 million consists of 75.9%
Chinese, 15.2% Malays, 6.5% Indians and 2.4% others.1.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-011#13:1>
Without a police force or army and fearing ethnic conflicts, Raffles
segregated the various ethnic groups geographically, assigning the jetty and
Singapore River areas to the Hokkien Chinese ( especially traders from
Malacca) and the British so as to facilitate their businesses.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-011#14:1>
This policy led eventually to the formation of ethnic and sub-ethnic
enclaves.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-011#15:1>
It made mutual understanding impossible and misunderstanding in turn
bred much prejudice and stereotyping.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-011#16:1>
The early settlers in Singapore, whether Chinese, Malay or Indian,
were predominantly illiterate or semi-literate and poor.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-011#17:1>
On the other hand, the British and other European traders and
colonial administrators were wealthy and powerful, and no doubt, were likely
to be looked up to as successful models for the poor Chinese, Malays and
Indians.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-011#18:1>
The British aim was single-mindedly to make money by exploiting every
opportunity available in Singapore and the region.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-011#19:1>
The Chinese and Indian immigrants were similarly motivated.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-011#20:1>
There were then many opportunities to create wealth in the new
country created especially to promote trade.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-011#21:1>
This rapidly gave rise to occupational and trade specialization by
various ethnic and sub-ethnic groups.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-011#22:1>
The British and other European and Hokkien merchants dominated
international trade, the British and Indians were prominent in colonial
administration and public works, the Cantonese and Hakkas specialized in
building and construction, and the Hainanese in food retail.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-011#23:1>
Gradually disparity in income and wealth appeared and widened among
individuals and ethnic groups as some trades and occupations offered more
than others.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-011#24:1>
Thus slowly a plural society evolved with closely bonded ethnic
groups divided by culture, religion, language and social class.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-011#25:1>
These ethnic groups were also segregated geographically and socially
as differences in language, religion and trade pulled them apart.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-011#26:1>
Thus the colony of Singapore was culturally, demographically and
politically an extension of Britain, Malaya, Indonesia, China and India as
these early settlers came to make money before returning to their homelands
to be re-united with their families and fellow countrymen.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-011#27:1>
There was no social cohesion to bind these ethnic groups together.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-011#28:1>
They did not comprise a nation, and it was unlikely that
nation-building instincts would arise from these competing and disparate
groups which felt no allegiance to this British trading colony.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-011#29:1>
<h> LONG-TERM SOLUTIONS FOR PLURAL SOCIETIES </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-011#30:1>
Today there are very few culturally homogeneous societies.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-011#31:1>
Due to conquest, colonization, international trade, forced migration
( slavery), voluntary migration, missionary activities and so forth, people
of diverse cultures, religions and languages came to co-exist within the same
political boundaries.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-011#32:1>
Thus plural societies are very common today.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-011#33:1>
Plural societies can be divided into four major categories: those
evolving due to ( 1) assimilation, ( 2) integration, ( 3) maintenance of
pluralism by coercion, and ( 4) disintegration.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-011#34:1>
These processes will be described below very briefly to provide
Singaporeans with a broader perspective and understanding of Singapore's own
pattern of ethnic relations and its likely direction of change.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-011#35:1>
Cultural Assimilation: A One-Way Process The United States is an
excellent example of cultural assimilation with reference to its white-black
relations.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-011#36:1>
Africans were forcibly brought to the United States and sold as
slaves more than two centuries ago.3 These African slaves came from different
parts of Africa.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-011#37:1>
They spoke different languages, practised different customs and
religions.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-011#38:1>
Working mainly in the plantations in the south, they were culturally
heterogeneous.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-011#39:1>
Under coercion they learned American English, dressed like American
plantation workers, ate American food, and eventually practised Christianity.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-011#40:1>
Two parallel processes transformed these black peoples over several
generations into black Americans: the gradual loss of their languages,
religions and customs, and the gradual assimilation of the culture of their
white Anglo-Saxon Protestant plantation masters and other whites.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-011#41:1>
It was thus a one-way process.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-011#42:1>
These slaves became culturally white and today share little in common
with Africans.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-011#43:1>
Due to their common experience of slavery, oppression by white
masters, and poverty after their liberation from slavery they developed a
black subculture which is still American and not African.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-011#44:1>
Attempts to return to their African roots in the 1960s failed.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-011#45:1>
Cut off for so long from their cultural roots - being unable to speak
their ancestral languages and unfamiliar with their ancestral customs and
religions - they cannot revive them as the basis for doing so is totally
absent.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-011#46:1>
That is, when assimilation has proceeded beyond a certain point when
a group has lost touch with its culture, it is not possible to revive that
culture.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-011#47:1>
Despite their cultural assimilation, black Americans were
discriminated against by white Americans in terms of education, employment,
voting rights, housing and so forth.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-011#48:1>
Due to such sustained discrimination in the past, black Americans
generally have a lower educational attainment than whites, lower income,
poorer housing, and are still often not accepted into clubs donated by
whites.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-011#49:1>
In short, cultural assimilation has not brought about social
assimilation, i.e., equal status and social acceptance by the dominant
whites.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-011#50:1>
There are, however, many liberal whites and other ethnic groups who
are sympathetic to the black Americans' cause or desire for full equality in
society, some of whom are active supporters of the black protest movements.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-011#51:1>
Cultural Integration: Processes of Fusion Africans were also sold to
Portuguese plantations in Brazil at about the same as those sold to American
plantations.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-011#52:1>
Initially the Portuguese captured the Amerindians and forced them to
work in their huge plantations.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-011#53:1>
These Amerindians came from different tribes, spoke different
languages and practised different customs and religious beliefs.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-011#54:1>
In short, they were culturally heterogeneous.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-011#55:1>
They hated sedentary work and their role as slaves and consequently
were low in productivity.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-011#56:1>
The Portuguese then turned to Africa for their source of labour,
bringing African slaves over in large numbers since the average Portuguese
plantation in Brazil needed about sixty workers.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-011#57:1>
The American plantations were small in comparison.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-011#58:1>
Portugal had once been conquered by the Moors of northern Africa.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-011#59:1>
The Moors kept slaves but treated them as human beings with some
rights.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-011#60:1>
The Portuguese had thus learnt about slavery from the Moors and
followed their example.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-011#61:1>
In comparison, the Anglo-Saxon American plantation owners treated
their slaves as property and as property, these slaves had no rights
whatsoever.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-011#62:1>
In Brazil, the Portuguese sometimes sent their skilled slaves ( e.g.
carpenters or blacksmiths) to work in the cities.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-011#63:1>
These slaves were permitted to keep some of their earnings while the
rest was remitted to their masters.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-011#64:1>
Thus some of them could often accumulate enough to buy back their
freedom.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-011#65:1>
Once they reached old age, some Portuguese masters would free their
favourite slaves, an act considered a measure of social grace in Brazilian
society.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-011#66:1>
Thus African slaves were treated very differently in the United
States and Brazil.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-011#67:1>
Portuguese plantation owners also kept some of their female
Amerindian and African slaves as " concubines".

<ICE-SIN:W2A-011#68:1>
Their offspring were often assigned an intermediate status between
their white master-father and brown/black slave-mother as plantation
supervisors or domestic servants in the big house.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-011#69:1>
Slowly such " miscegenation" produced sub-populations of mestizos and
mulattos.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-011#70:1>
And then mestizos and mulattos intermarried.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-011#71:1>
Gradually a wide spectrum of " colours" from white through shades of
brown and shades of grey to black evolved and Brazilians thus appear.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-011#72:1>
Brazilian culture also emerges through this century-long evolution as
Portuguese, Amerindian and African cultures, languages, customs, crafts,
arts, dances, and music slowly fused together.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-011#73:1>
Of course, the Portuguese component is the dominant component in this
Brazilian integration.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-011#74:1>
These cultural and biological changes took place unevenly in Brazil,
which is a vast country, integration being somewhat more incomplete in the
less developed, remote areas.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-011#75:1>
Today, Brazil's constitution prohibits " racial" discrimination.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-011#76:1>
But ethnic prejudice is nevertheless still alive and is manifested
chiefly in a preference for the fair complexion over the dark.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-011#77:1>
In Brazil, however, money or land " bleaches" - a rich man,
regardless of his skin colour, is called a blanco ( white), i.e., the darker
Brazilians are accepted socially by their fairer compatriots if they have
succeeded economically.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-011#78:1>
Preservation of Pluralism by Coercion The Union of South Africa is an
excellent example of a plural society where pluralism is maintained by force
to the advantage of whites.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-011#79:1>
About 20% of the population consists of whites.5 Among them about 60%
are of Dutch origin and the rest of British origin.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-011#80:1>
Africans of diverse tribal origins constitute about 70% of the
population, while the Coloureds constitute the remaining 10%.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-011#81:1>
Some of these Africans were historical enemies.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-011#82:1>
At the initial stage of inter-group contact, the Dutch colonials were
concerned about religious differences.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-011#83:1>
When some Africans became Christians, there were some intermarriages
between them and the Coloureds were produced.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-011#84:1>
Then the World Wars brought racism to South Africa.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-011#85:1>
The British controlled the economy but the more numerous Afrikaners
of Dutch origin soon dominated polities.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-011#86:1>
Fearing competition from the Africans and the Coloureds, the latter
eventually imposed apartheid policies designed to protect and enhance their
economic interests at the expense of the nonwhites.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-011#87:1>
The British cooperated with them.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-011#88:1>
Force is used readily by whites to impose their dominance and sustain
a plural society of great inequalities between whites and non-whites in
terms of political power, wealth, income, housing and education.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-011#89:1>
In the name of preserving their African roots, African children
receive an education indigenous in content in their tribal languages and are
denied an Afrikaner, modern education.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-011#90:1>
The tribes are residentially segregated.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-011#91:1>
The apartheid constitution also denies them well-paid skilled jobs.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-011#92:1>
Restaurants and other public service organizations openly segregate
clients into whites and non-whites who are served in the respective
white-only or non-white areas.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-011#93:1>
A Multi-Tribal Society Fragmented Nigeria in the 1960s exemplified
the difficulties of holding a plural, i.e., multi-tribal, society together.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-011#94:1>
Due to differences in degree of urban concentration, in cultures,
educational attainment and occupational specialization, inter-tribal
differences gradually appeared in terms of political power, wealth, income
and housing.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-011#95:1>
The political parties were predominantly tribe-based.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-011#96:1>
Political contests thus became tribal conflicts.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-011#97:1>
Eventually, civil war broke out and Nigeria was split along tribal
lines.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-011#98:1>
The armed forces then took control of the government and suspended
politics.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-011#99:1>
A few years later the military government ordered the political
parties to reorganize themselves into multi-tribal parties so that no single
party could be dominated by any other tribe.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-011#100:1>
Political activity was resumed but soon the parties each became
increasingly dominated by one tribe and they began to espouse the causes of
their tribal constituents.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-011#101:1>
Conflicts broke out and the military again took control.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-011#102:1>
Without military intervention, Nigeria would have disintegrated into
three smaller states, each representing one major tribe.6 Sri Lanka and
Nicaragua are recent parallel cases.7 The Nigerian example illustrates
poignantly how fragile a plural society can be and how it can easily
disintegrate along ethnic lines.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-011#103:1>
It also illustrates how ethnic interests promoted without regard for
the mutual interests of the society in general, or for the legitimate
interests of other groups, can lead to inter-group conflicts.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-011#104:1>
In the end, all ethnic groups become the losers.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-011#105:1>
Modern-day domestic conflicts invariably invite outside covert or
overt intervention, which naturally complicates the already complicated
political situation, often tending to prolong the conflict and make equitable
resolution among groups extremely difficult.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-011#106:1>
<h> RELEVANCE OF THE ABOVE CASES TO SINGAPORE </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-011#107:1>
These four cases show that the plural society of Singapore can
develop in any one of the above four directions. <X>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-011#X108:1>
If assimilation is to be the long-term goal, then the culture of
the dominant group will be internalized by members of minority groups.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-011#X109:1>
That is, the Malays, Indians and Others are expected gradually to
drop their own cultures and gradually to adopt the culture of the Chinese.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-011#X110:1>
Since Singapore is situated in the Malay archipelago, this
assimilation option was already recognized by all the political parties in
Singapore in 1955 to be a non-viable option, one which would invite Malay and
Muslim intervention from outside the city-state.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-011#X111:1>
Likewise, if pluralism is to be pursued as a goal for maintaining
the dominant position of the Chinese in terms of political power, wealth and
income, the minorities are likely to seek foreign assistance in their
resistance to Chinese domination.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-011#X112:1>
If this were to happen, Singapore would be heading in the same
direction as Nigeria in the 1960s and 1970s.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-011#X113:1>
Economic and other developments require a relatively long period of
political stability in order to ensure investors and skilled workers that
they can make long-term plans with a minimum of uncertainty, especially for
projects with a long gestation period before capital or effort can be
recovered.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-011#X114:1>
Thus, political instability will scare away capital and skilled
manpower and so inhibits economic growth.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-011#X115:1>
It seems obvious that assimilation and the preservation of
pluralism are not viable options for Singapore.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-011#X116:1>
The only choice that remains is integration as exemplified by
Brazil and other Latin American societies where cultures fuse to varying
degrees.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-011#X117:1>
The ultimate outcome will be a new, homogeneous culture and
society.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-011#X118:1>
The United States is also an example where the various European
cultures have fused into an American culture where the Anglo-Saxon component
is the dominant part of this hybrid.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-011#X119:1>
Whether it is assimilation or integration, the processes of change
are bound to be painful to some individuals and groups in the short run.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-011#X120:1>
If the pace of change is sustained by political will, a point will
be reached when it becomes very difficult to revert back since so much has
already been lost and forgotten, and when it becomes very easy just to move
ahead towards the ultimate assimilation or integration. </X> </I>
