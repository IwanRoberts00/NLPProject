<ICE-SIN:S2A-018#1:1:A>
And a very good afternoon to you sports fans

<ICE-SIN:S2A-018#2:1:A>
This is Fong Ho Beng together with guest commentator Toto Dermati at
the Toa Payoh swimming complex bringing you live action of the waterpolo
waterpolo game between Singapore and Malaysia

<ICE-SIN:S2A-018#3:1:A>
Singapore in white caps are leading now by ten goals by nothing and
it's Malaysia at ten goals to one I beg your pardon

<ICE-SIN:S2A-018#4:1:A>
Malaysia just broke the guards about two minutes ago uh towards the
first part of the fourth quarter and now Singapore on the attack

<ICE-SIN:S2A-018#5:1:A>
Uh Singapore has been leading all the way and uh they've got the
gold medal sown up uh signed sealed and delivered so to speak

<ICE-SIN:S2A-018#6:1:A>
Malaysia needs to beat Singapore to win a medal but it doesn't look
like they're gonna do it trailing by ten goals to one

<ICE-SIN:S2A-018#7:1:A>
And now it's uh Malaysia back on the attack Malaysia playing from
left to right in the blue caps and that's number seven Choo Keng Soo with the
ball looking for an opening

<ICE-SIN:S2A-018#8:1:A>
James Tan James Tan tries a long and Singapore right on attack with
number six there Aw Kam Mun one on one with the goalkeeper

<ICE-SIN:S2A-018#9:1:A>
It looks like a penalty shot

<ICE-SIN:S2A-018#10:1:A>
High low he was just a little bit too complacent there one on one
with the goalkeeper Aw Aw Kam Mun and he just could not convert

<ICE-SIN:S2A-018#11:1:A>
That would be a a nightmare for him for tonight

<ICE-SIN:S2A-018#12:1:A>
He could have scored that goal but fortunately it's not a crucial
goal

<ICE-SIN:S2A-018#13:1:A>
It may just make no difference even if he scored it or not

<ICE-SIN:S2A-018#14:1:A>
And it's Lim Teik Yin with a free throw

<ICE-SIN:S2A-018#15:1:A>
And the cap has come off

<ICE-SIN:S2A-018#16:1:A>
And we are very honoured uh this afternoon to be uh to have the
presence of none other than President Wee Kim Wee and of course uh we are
also very very honoured to have our Prime Minister here with us as well as
Doctor Yeo Ning Hong

<ICE-SIN:S2A-018#17:1:A>
You're watching with great interest this final game and goal scored
by Matthew oh number six Aw Kum Mun goal number eleven scored by Aw Kum Mun
of Singapore

<ICE-SIN:S2A-018#18:1:A>
And we are in the fourth quarter of this waterpolo game and watch
that goal scored by Aw Kum Mun very nicely done and as I said earlier
Singapore has already won the goal medal

<ICE-SIN:S2A-018#19:1:A>
This game is academic even if they lost this game they would still
win the gold medal

<ICE-SIN:S2A-018#20:1:A>
But Malaysia has to beat Singapore by at least three goals to
secure a silver medal

<ICE-SIN:S2A-018#21:1:A>
And Malaysia who's on the attack even with the goalkeeper coming
way out to the ten metre mark Tiong Siong Pew being swarmed by Singapore
defence Franklin Tan

<ICE-SIN:S2A-018#22:1:A>
A throw for Franklin and number seven Choo Keng Soo wins a free
throw and another goal scored by Tan Kan Ghee

<ICE-SIN:S2A-018#23:1:A>
Eleven to two both goals scored by Tan Kan Ghee cap number two of
Malaysia and the scored line stands at eleven to two in favour of Singapore

<ICE-SIN:S2A-018#24:1:A>
Well Toto what are your comments so far about this game

<ICE-SIN:S2A-018#25:1:A>
And Malaysia on the attack once again Hee Ding Tiong switch Choo
Keng Soo Franklin Tan Tiong Siong Pew and the free throw goes back to Matthew

<ICE-SIN:S2A-018#26:1:A>
And Singapore on the attack Daniel Wee Daniel Wee is trying no

<ICE-SIN:S2A-018#27:1:A>
He's given back to Matthew and Matthew tries

<ICE-SIN:S2A-018#28:1:A>
Matthew Tan the captain of the Singapore team scoring goal number
twelve making it a round dozen

<ICE-SIN:S2A-018#29:1:A>
Twelve two Singapore leading in this fourth quarter of the
waterpolo game

<ICE-SIN:S2A-018#30:1:A>
I was afraid that uh Singapore might be complacent uh at the
beginning of this game but apparently not

<ICE-SIN:S2A-018#31:1:A>
There's less than two minutes left in uh this whole wa waterpolo
match between Singapore and Malaysia and Singapore is leading twelve to two
in the fourth quarter

<ICE-SIN:S2A-018#32:1:A>
Mass confusion in in front of the Singapore goal

<ICE-SIN:S2A-018#33:1:A>
An ejection of Matthew Tan

<ICE-SIN:S2A-018#34:1:A>
No it's Daniel Tan his first ejection for first <unclear> word
</unclear> foul

<ICE-SIN:S2A-018#35:1:A>
Lee Ding Tiong

<ICE-SIN:S2A-018#36:1:A>
Tang Khoon Ghee

<ICE-SIN:S2A-018#37:1:A>
Choo Keng Soo

<ICE-SIN:S2A-018#38:1:A>
Ding Keong

<ICE-SIN:S2A-018#39:1:A>
Good attempt there by number eight Tiong Siong Pew scoring goal
number three for Malaysia

<ICE-SIN:S2A-018#40:1:A>
Matthew Tan with the ball and being harassed by number twelve James
Tan Fong Ho Yin

<ICE-SIN:S2A-018#41:1:A>
The last minute of the game

<ICE-SIN:S2A-018#42:1:A>
One minute warning being given and can Singapore make it number
thirteen

<ICE-SIN:S2A-018#43:1:A>
Eighteen seconds left in the goal <unclear> word </unclear> and yes
number five Ho Wei Meng has made goal number thirteen for Singapore

<ICE-SIN:S2A-018#44:1:A>
Singapore leading thirteen to three

<ICE-SIN:S2A-018#45:1:A>
Not much time left in this waterpolo game with forty seconds left
and uh Malaysia will probably make a fast break of it

<ICE-SIN:S2A-018#46:1:A>
Even the goalkeeper has come up look at that goalkeeper has come up
to the halfway mark and they want to try to score another goal but I think
Singapore is gonna deny them of that

<ICE-SIN:S2A-018#47:1:A>
And they try to

<ICE-SIN:S2A-018#48:1:A>
Yes

<ICE-SIN:S2A-018#49:1:A>
Tiong Siong Pew trying very very hard there and uh Singapore's
gonna let the clock run now I think uh I think

<ICE-SIN:S2A-018#50:1:A>
Less than twenty seconds left

<ICE-SIN:S2A-018#51:1:A>
And uh that is the end of the waterpolo game between Singapore and
Malaysia

<ICE-SIN:S2A-018#52:1:A>
Singapore winning thirteen goals to three

<ICE-SIN:S2A-018#53:1:A>
And uh we have a host of V I Ps here at this Toa Payoh swimming
complex

<ICE-SIN:S2A-018#54:1:A>
Our President Wee Kim Wee is here

<ICE-SIN:S2A-018#55:1:A>
Our Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong is here

<ICE-SIN:S2A-018#56:1:A>
Our Defence Minister Doctor Yeo Ning Hong is here and uh we're
wondering who is gonna present the medals to the winners

<ICE-SIN:S2A-018#57:1:A>
Uh it will be a little while yet as the players uh uh get together
and get ready to for the prize presentation and uh we do not have news yet as
to who is to present the medal and uh while we're finding out let's go for a
commercial break

<ICE-SIN:S2A-018#58:1:A>
And welcome back to Toa Payoh swimming complex as we witness the
victory ceremony for the waterpolo competition

<ICE-SIN:S2A-018#59:1:A>
Singapore has done it again their fifteen goal medal in the series

<ICE-SIN:S2A-018#60:1:A>
They have not lost one single waterpolo game in the entire SEA
Games and SEAP Games series

<ICE-SIN:S2A-018#61:1:A>
There was no waterpolo played uh at the first SEAP Games in Bangkok
in nineteen fifty-nine

<ICE-SIN:S2A-018#62:1:A>
Uh there was no waterpolo uh at Rangoon for the second SEA Games
but subsequently there was waterpolo uh being played at every SEA Games and
SEAP Games after that and this is the fifteen time that Singapore has won and
they have not lost one single game

<ICE-SIN:S2A-018#63:1:A>
Now that's a record for other sports to try to emulate

<ICE-SIN:S2A-018#64:1:A>
President Wee Kim Wee himself is going to present the medal to the
winners and uh he's accompanied by Defence Minister Doctor Yeo Ning Hong

<ICE-SIN:S2A-018#65:1:A>
That's cer certainly is a singular honour for the waterpolo team

<ICE-SIN:S2A-018#66:1:A>
A proud moment for Matthew Tan and his boys

<ICE-SIN:S2A-018#67:1:A>
All thirteen players going up the rostrum and that's Matthew Tan
receiving the gold medal from President Wee and that's Lim Teik Yin Major Lim
Teik Yin Daniel Wee

<ICE-SIN:S2A-018#68:1:A>
Very proud moment for the Singapore players

<ICE-SIN:S2A-018#69:1:A>
And Doctor Yeo Ning Hong assisting the President

<ICE-SIN:S2A-018#70:1:A>
There's thirteen medals to be given away gets a bit tiring but
that's a pleasant task nevertheless

<ICE-SIN:S2A-018#71:1:A>
Great moments for the Singapore players

<ICE-SIN:S2A-018#72:1:A>
They beat Malaysia this afternoon by the score of thirteen to three

<ICE-SIN:S2A-018#73:1:A>
And Philippines wins the silver medal

<ICE-SIN:S2A-018#74:1:A>
A lot of veterans on the Philippine team I believe that's one
player who's forty years old

<ICE-SIN:S2A-018#75:1:A>
He's almost as old as I am

<ICE-SIN:S2A-018#76:1:A>
Proud moment for the Philippine team as well

<ICE-SIN:S2A-018#77:1:A>
It's a tough way to get a medal

<ICE-SIN:S2A-018#78:1:A>
You've got five days of competition bruising <unclear> word
</unclear> competition at that

<ICE-SIN:S2A-018#79:1:A>
I must say the waterpolo matches uh during this series has not been
as robust as uh in previous games

<ICE-SIN:S2A-018#80:1:A>
I've seen players coming up with uh missing teeth and scratches all
over the backs and uh torn swim suits but uh this particular series the
seventeenth SEA Games have been rather tame compared to other waterpolo
matches

<ICE-SIN:S2A-018#81:1:A>
Perhaps all the other teams have resigned to the fact that
Singapore are the kingpins

<ICE-SIN:S2A-018#82:1:A>
And uh Indonesia wins the bronze medal in waterpolo

<ICE-SIN:S2A-018#83:1:A>
President Wee doing the honours

<ICE-SIN:S2A-018#84:1:A>
This is indeed a very proud moment to receive a medal from
President Wee Kim Wee himself a moment that all the athletes should treasure
for the rest of their lives

<ICE-SIN:S2A-018#85:1:A>
And Doctor Yeo Ning Hong assisting

<ICE-SIN:S2A-018#86:1:A>
Doctor Yeo the Defence Minister is also the President of the
Singapore Olympic Sports Council Singapore National of the Council I beg your
pardon

<ICE-SIN:S2A-018#87:1:A>
And talking about that we have a lot of V I Ps here Mister Ng Ser
Miang the President of the Singapore Sports Council is here Mister S S Dylon
the Secretary-General of the uh Singapore National Olympic Council is here

<ICE-SIN:S2A-018#88:1:A>
Practically anybody who is anybody in sports is here this afternoon
at Toa Payoh and a round of applause for everybody in particular President
Wee Kim Seng for bracing the occasion

<ICE-SIN:S2A-018#89:1:A>
And the proud moment for the Singapore waterpolo team

<ICE-SIN:S2A-018#90:1:A>
A round of applause here from Toa Payoh and uh with that we go back
to the studio for commercial break to be followed by uh a commentary on Sepak
Takaw by Mark Richmond

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-018#91:1:B>
Welcome to the Singapore Badminton Hall for the Inter-regu
<unclear> word </unclear> Sepak Takaw finals the gold medal match between
Singapore and Malaysia

<ICE-SIN:S2A-018#92:1:B>
The Singapore trio of Nor Hisham Adam Mohammud Rafi Abdullah Majid
and Ranji Osmund against Malaysia's world champions Nordin Sabarudin Arshari
Hashim and Rosli Abdul Rafman

<ICE-SIN:S2A-018#93:1:B>
Singapore down by ten thirteen in the first <unclear> word
</unclear>

<ICE-SIN:S2A-018#94:1:B>
Of course remember they dealt Malaysia a huge psychological blow in
the preliminary rounds where they beat the same trio by two sets to love

<ICE-SIN:S2A-018#95:1:B>
They qualified for this final by beating the Indonesia trio while
the Malaysians overcame the Thai trio in the repeat of uh the last SEA Games
final

<ICE-SIN:S2A-018#96:1:B>
Ten thirteen down the first set and we played thirty-two minutes of
this set so far

<ICE-SIN:S2A-018#97:1:B>
The ball's gone out to illegal grounds and they refused to get now
the advantage to two points the Malaysians up as many as six at one time

<ICE-SIN:S2A-018#98:1:B>
They threatened to take the set at thirteen nine but now they're
faced with Singapore serving at eleven thirteen

<ICE-SIN:S2A-018#99:1:B>
With me is uh Siram Ohmar you've seen so far your comments your
comments

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-018#100:1:C>
Yes Singapore started off slow four points behind and then
they they allow the Malaysians to get far ahead but they've settled down
after quite a nervous start

<ICE-SIN:S2A-018#101:1:C>
They've come back and they've even manage really quite well

<ICE-SIN:S2A-018#102:1:C>
Uh they just called back another point

<ICE-SIN:S2A-018#103:1:C>
It's twelve thirteen

<ICE-SIN:S2A-018#104:1:C>
Singapore of course one point away now from forcing this just in
this first set

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-018#105:1:B>
All the Singaporeans were down by four love

<ICE-SIN:S2A-018#106:1:B>
They came back to join level four all

<ICE-SIN:S2A-018#107:1:B>
They were down by ten four

<ICE-SIN:S2A-018#108:1:B>
They came back to reduce it to ten nine

<ICE-SIN:S2A-018#109:1:B>
They were down by nine thirteen and now they have serve at twelve
thirteen

<ICE-SIN:S2A-018#110:1:B>
So really this regu from them have shown a lot of character

<ICE-SIN:S2A-018#111:1:B>
Helped a little of course by the Malaysian <unclear> word
</unclear>

<ICE-SIN:S2A-018#112:1:B>
The takaw has gone out at time and the Malaysians call for a time
out

<ICE-SIN:S2A-018#113:1:B>
The Malaysians haven't really looked very impressive yet neither
have the Singaporeans to be fair but the uh considering that they are world
champions and they have a very good chemistry between them the combination
between Rosli Abdul Rafman and the smasher chief smasher Shari Hashim hasn't
been very good

<ICE-SIN:S2A-018#114:1:B>
Shari in fact has missed out on a lot of opportunities to kill the
points off and in the block department both sides have had one successful
block each

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-018#115:1:C>
Yes uh Singapore must uh keep their heads together

<ICE-SIN:S2A-018#116:1:C>
They're only one point adrift

<ICE-SIN:S2A-018#117:1:C>
They were like you said at times uh more than six points adrift

<ICE-SIN:S2A-018#118:1:C>
They've pulled back well

<ICE-SIN:S2A-018#119:1:C>
They've fought well and I think in the back of the Malaysians
minds' they will be wondering whether they will ever get to see the end of
this because they just can't see it to finish off the Singaporeans </I>
