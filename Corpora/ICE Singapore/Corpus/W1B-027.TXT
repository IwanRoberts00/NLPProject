As indicated in the circulars, the University will implement the new

<ICE-SIN:W1B-027#8:1>
In this regard, I would like to confirm that, subject to your
acceptance, you will be designated as an Assistant Professor with effect from
1 August 1998, and that the salary scale of
&dollar;3750x2506750/(7000;7250;7500;7750) for the grade will apply to your
appointment from the same date.

( With reference to the salary scale, the salary points within
brackets are discretionary points and may be granted on a personal-to-holder
basis.)

Please note that your current salary and incremental date will remain
unchanged on re-designation, and that the other terms and conditions of your
current Agreement for Service with the University will continue to apply.

You will continue to be reviewed annually by the Establishment
Committee in October/November or April/May of each year, depending on your
incremental date.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-027#12:1>
You may, however, opt to remain on your current designation and

In the case of those who opt to remain on their current designation
and salary scale, the University will allow such staff members to convert at
any time to the new designation and salary scale should they so request.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-027#15:1>
Given the new grades of appointment/designations for teaching staff,
the University has reviewed the promotion criteria and procedure for
promotion to a Professorship.

<h> TALENT DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMME: INDEPENDENT STUDY MODULE </h>

<ICE-SIN:W1B-027#57:3>
As indicated at previous Heads' meetings, three independent study
modules will be introduced for FASS students in the Talent Development
Programme.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-027#58:3>
This is part of the revamp of the TDP that all Faculties are
undergoing.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-027#59:3>
En bloc Senate approval will be obtained for the new programmes in
time for the second semester of 1998/99.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-027#60:3>
Students from the 1997/98 cohort will have the option of reading up
to three such modules.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-027#61:3>
Students from the 1998/99 cohort will be expected to have three
independent study modules.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-027#62:3>
For these modules to work, students will have to discuss in detail
with proposed supervisors the shape and content of the module.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-027#63:3>
It is therefore imperative that all staff are aware of this
development.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-027#64:3>
I seek your help to circulate this information.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-027#65:3>
The proposed module description is as follows: The aim of these
modules is to allow students to focus on any area within a discipline that is
of particular interest to them and to read in-depth into the area under the
guidance of a staff mentor.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-027#66:3>
The module will take the form of a " reading course", where students,
with the help of their mentor, identify the key works in a particular area
and read critically these works together with their mentor.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-027#67:3>
Students will be evaluated on the basis of their continuous
assessment, which may take the form of presentations, essays and/ or
projects.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-027#68:3>
Each module will be conducted over a semester and will have the
weightage of four modular credits.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-027#69:3>
Staff are expected to meet with students regularly on a weekly basis
for at least two hours a week.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-027#70:3>
I have enclosed a form that students will have to fill up if they
wish to apply to read the module(s).

<ICE-SIN:W1B-027#71:3>
This form Is available to them on NUSNET ( under " Student
Services").

<ICE-SIN:W1B-027#72:3>
Please also let staff know about this.

<h> NUS NAME AND COAT OF ARMS </h>

<ICE-SIN:W1B-027#85:4>
The words 'National University of Singapore' and the Coat of Arms
have been registered with the Registrar of Trade Marks since 30 August 1993
to ensure that these are protected and legal actions can be taken against
unauthorised use of these marks.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-027#86:4>
The NUS name and coat of arms can only be printed on materials which
are meant for official use.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-027#87:4>
Publicity materials for activities ( eg.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-027#88:4>
conferences, exhibitions, etc.) which the Faculty / Department hosts
or co-hosts may also bear the name and coat of arms of the University.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-027#89:4>
Students, student societies and clubs must seek approval through the
Office of Student Affairs for the use of the University name and coat of
arms.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-027#90:4>
Faculties are asked to note that permission should not be given to
students to print business cards.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-027#91:4>
If students need to confirm their student status, the Department can
provide them with a letter.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-027#92:4>
They can also produce their student card.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-027#93:4>
Business cards bearing the University's name and coat of arms are
meant strictly for staff of the University.

Dear Cardmember,

<ICE-SIN:W1B-027#100:5>
November 1993

<ICE-SIN:W1B-027#101:5>
Some time ago, I sent you some information about a new accident
cover - The Personal Accident Protector - which pays up to
&dollar;600,000 for accidental death or disability.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-027#102:5>
It came with 30 days free cover no-obligation trial and guaranteed
acceptance.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-027#103:5>
Plus you could enrol right away.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-027#104:5>
No medical examination required or any payment upfront.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-027#105:5>
This offer ends 30 November 1993 and we're concerned that some of
you have either overlooked my first letter or just didn't receive it and will
therefore miss out on this opportunity.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-027#106:5>
Now, I'm writing again to alert you that there's still time to enrol
to enjoy 30 days free cover with absolutely no obligation.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-027#107:5>
That is, if you haven't already done so.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-027#108:5>
I'm sure you would welcome another opportunity to reconsider.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-027#109:5>
Because even with such a small premium, the cover offers: up to
S&dollar;200,000 cash in the event of permanent total disability, loss of limbs, or
loss of sight due to an accident S&dollar;150,000 cash in the event of death due to
a road traffic accident, or S&dollar;100,000 for other types of accident S&dollar;300 per
month for 60 months to each dependent child, if either one of the insured
parents suffers a fatal accident or up to S&dollar;600,000 to ensure your children's
future if the worst should happen, and you and your insured spouse are both
killed in the same accident What's more, it protects you all year round, day
or night, worldwide.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-027#110:5>
If you've acted earlier, and have the cover now, you would have
stopped worrying.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-027#111:5>
About accidents, about the money, about your family's future.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-027#112:5>
You would have peace of mind.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-027#113:5>
However, it's still not too late.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-027#114:5>
We've enclosed an extra enrolment form here.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-027#115:5>
Why not take a few minutes now to fill and post it in?

<ICE-SIN:W1B-027#116:5>
Your coverage begins immediately once your correctly completed form
is received by the Insurance Company of North America.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-027#117:5>
It's a pleasure serving you.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-027#118:5>
Yours sincerely,

P/S If you are not completely satisfied with the policy, you can
return the cover at no charge within 30 days.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-027#122:5>
But we must receive your enrolment form before 30 November 1993.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-027#135:6>
