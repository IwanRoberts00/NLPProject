<ICE-SIN:W2B-020#4:1>
<h> My Childhood </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-020#5:1>
I like to think that my own beginnings are loosely intertwined with
the beginning of Singapore itself.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-020#6:1>
As a port, Singapore's existence has always depended on the sea - and
especially on shipping.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-020#7:1>
Similarly, as a family, my immediate ancestors had also depended on
the sea and on shipping for their livelihood.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-020#8:1>
The first member of my family to come to Singapore was my
great-grandfather.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-020#9:1>
Ho Chong was a shipwright - a carpenter skilled in the construction
and repair of ships.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-020#10:1>
In the 1840s, he arrived as a young man in the bustling new port of
Singapore, about twenty years after its founding by Raffles.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-020#11:1>
China had just lost the Opium War, and the country was in the midst
of political turmoil and severe poverty.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-020#12:1>
Like many other pioneers from southern China who emigrated to
Singapore, my Cantonese great-grandfather must have sensed that this was a
land of opportunity.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-020#13:1>
He was right.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-020#14:1>
From his humble beginnings as a carpenter, he was later to establish
his own shipyard, building junks and later steamers in Tanjong Rhu.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-020#15:1>
It must have been a relatively large shipyard at the time, because
there is official record of a fire in it.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-020#16:1>
This was described in Song Ong Siang's book, A Hundred Years of the
Chinese in Singapore.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-020#17:1>
In April 1867 an attempt was made to set fire to the extensive
premises of Ho Ah Chong and to murder him.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-020#18:1>
This shipwright, who had come to Singapore in the Forties, had been
until 1864 the foreman at Messrs Tivendale's yard at Sandy Point ( Tanjong
Rhu).

<ICE-SIN:W2B-020#19:1>
In that year he started business as a shipwright and blacksmith, next
to his former employer's premises, and employed between two and three hundred
men.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-020#20:1>
Like many of the early Chinese immigrants here, Ho Chong later
returned to China, where he married and where his children were all born.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-020#21:1>
His oldest son, Ho Guang Yan, followed in his father's footsteps, and
also came to Singapore as a young man to work in the Tanjong Rhu shipyards.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-020#22:1>
Presumably he also returned to China at some point and started a
family there, because his five sons were all born in China.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-020#23:1>
He died five years after his fifth and youngest son - my own father -
was born.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-020#24:1>
My father, Ho Ting, born in 1892, was therefore the third generation
of Chinese who, although born in China, spent a large part of their working
life in the Tanjong Rhu shipyards of Singapore.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-020#25:1>
On my mother's side, I am only able to trace back two generations.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-020#26:1>
My mother's father, Seck Yek Kuon, was born in Canton, China, and
came to Singapore in the 1880s.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-020#27:1>
He became a contractor responsible for painting ships, and was quite
prosperous.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-020#28:1>
Like many other men of his time, he returned to China and married
there.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-020#29:1>
Their first child, born in 1895, was my mother, Seck Choy Fung.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-020#30:1>
It is safe to hypothesize that both my father and my mother came to
Singapore at about the same time, shortly after the turn of the century.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-020#31:1>
Each already had their respective family ties in Singapore.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-020#32:1>
After a few years here, they were introduced through a matchmaker,
and were married in 1913.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-020#33:1>
My father was twenty-one years old and my mother was just eighteen.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-020#34:1>
They settled in a corner of my uncle's boat yard, where my father
worked as a carpenter, living in a small wooden house with a zinc roof built
a few feet off the ground.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-020#35:1>
There, in quick succession over the next fourteen years, they had
seven children: my elder sister Yue Ying ( 1915), me ( 1917), my second
sister Yue Mei ( 1918), my brother Yat Wing ( 1920), my third sister Yue Qun
( 1923), my fourth sister Yue Lian ( 1926) and my fifth sister Yue Xian (
1927).

<ICE-SIN:W2B-020#36:1>
Our childhood was spent playing barefoot around the half-finished
hulls in the boat yard.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-020#37:1>
We had the sand and we had the sea and we had each other.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-020#38:1>
I don't remember feeling poor or particularly deprived, although I do
know that when my third sister had a serious case of worms, she was taken to
the Poor People's Hospital, so financially we must have been quite poor.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-020#39:1>
By today's standards, our home would be considered very crowded.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-020#40:1>
There were only two rooms.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-020#41:1>
My mother and five sisters shared the bedroom ( three on a bed, three
on the floor, on a piece of linoleum which was added later), while my father,
my brother and I would use the living room to sleep in, setting up our
folding canvas cots every night.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-020#42:1>
I never remembered my mother complaining, although she must have felt
very pressured and unhappy sometimes.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-020#43:1>
One of my earliest memories is of mother threatening to commit
suicide.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-020#44:1>
She must have been offended by her children or our father.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-020#45:1>
On one dark evening, in front of the house, she said she wanted to
kill herself by jumping into the sea.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-020#46:1>
I was scared and cried, and clung to her legs.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-020#47:1>
This lasted a few minutes.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-020#48:1>
Finally, she went back to the house.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-020#49:1>
Up to this day, I don't know how seriously she meant it.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-020#50:1>
I think I was four or five years old then.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-020#51:1>
My mother did all the cooking but my father did the shopping, perhaps
because he wanted to have sole control of the money, and also perhaps because
he simply enjoyed it.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-020#52:1>
Every morning, my father went to the main ( and only) road of Tanjong
Rhu, to do the marketing.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-020#53:1>
I have fond memories of my father holding onto my hand as we walked
around the marketplace.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-020#54:1>
The hawkers brought their vegetables, seafood, and meat in baskets
and laid them out along the roadside for the customers to buy.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-020#55:1>
In addition to those fresh foods, some cooked food was also served by
hawkers, mainly for the workers as breakfast.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-020#56:1>
One of the food hawkers was our seventh grandaunt, whom I remember
very well.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-020#57:1>
She sold rice congee with gingko nuts.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-020#58:1>
The eldest and most senior member of the Ho Clan, she was a tiny
figure under five feet, weighing possibly eighty to eighty-five pounds, but
she always looked dignified.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-020#59:1>
Even much later, when she was old and wrinkled at eighty, she was
active and agile, looking after a large group of grand and great-grand
children.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-020#60:1>
She was ten years older than my mother and yet outlived my mother.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-020#61:1>
During her old age, she still came to my mother's home every Chinese
New Year to pay an annual visit.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-020#62:1>
On these occasions, I always gave her a red packet of two hundred
dollars, knowing that she needed the money for her large brood.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-020#63:1>
On January 6, 1982, she gave me a red packet containing two dollars
through my mother with a blessing for my good luck and good health.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-020#64:1>
That same year, she finally passed away at the age of ninety-seven.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-020#65:1>
I still treasure the red packet of two dollars from her, and keep it
carefully in the locked drawer of my desk at home.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-020#66:1>
Our second uncle was the second eldest of my father's five brothers.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-020#67:1>
He was an opium smoker and he must have come to Singapore at an early
age.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-020#68:1>
I visited him for the first time at the workers' dormitory of a
family friend's boat yard.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-020#69:1>
I had to walk up three flights of rickety wooden stairs to see him.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-020#70:1>
He was smoking opium inside a little room.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-020#71:1>
I have only vague recollections of him now.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-020#72:1>
I do not know what he was doing at the boat yard.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-020#73:1>
The third uncle was the father of Fuon Gor who is seventy-three or
seventy-four by now.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-020#74:1>
I remember this third uncle as a big, tall and husky man, who
commanded the respect of all his workers.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-020#75:1>
He was a heavy drinker.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-020#76:1>
As my father's older brother, he placed my father as an apprentice in
his boat yard, and built our house next to it.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-020#77:1>
This was where my father learned his trade as a boat builder.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-020#78:1>
Third Uncle died at the age of only fifty-nine or sixty of some sort
of liver trouble, most likely as a result of his drinking.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-020#79:1>
Of his wife I don't recall much.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-020#80:1>
But when I grew much older, I learned from my mother and sisters,
that she was quite a mean woman, always picking on my mother in trivial
matters, complaining, for example, that my mother's children were scavengers,
and picking up too many nails from the ground of her husband's shipyard.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-020#81:1>
She had one daughter and one son.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-020#82:1>
My youngest sister was once adopted by her, but she could not stomach
it and ran back home after a short while.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-020#83:1>
( This is why my youngest sister was not in the family picture taken
before I went to China to study).

<ICE-SIN:W2B-020#84:1>
And so my boyhood years were spent in the shipyard at Tanjong Rhu,
within a poor but hardworking and loving family.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-020#85:1>
It was only when I reached school-going age, at seven, that my world
expanded beyond this, out towards the city district of Singapore.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-020#86:1>
Since there was no school in Tanjong Rhu, I was sent to the city of
Singapore to attend school.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-020#87:1>
The school chosen for me was Yang Zheng Chinese School.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-020#88:1>
It was located at today's Club Street, and was the logical school for
me to go to, since it was a Cantonese school, using Cantonese as the medium
of instruction.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-020#89:1>
In addition, my maternal grandfather was one of the directors of the
School, and his second son, who was two years older than I, was already
attending school there.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-020#90:1>
Since it was impossible for me to commute from Tanjong Rhu to school
every day, I was made to stay with my maternal grandfather.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-020#91:1>
He had already made a name for himself, at least among the Cantonese
circle, and was considered well to do.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-020#92:1>
He was a contractor responsible for painting ships with Keppel
Shipyard.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-020#93:1>
In those years, contractors like my maternal grandfather could, and
apparently did, make a small fortune by bribing the British supervisor.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-020#94:1>
For instance, when there was a painting job to be done, the
contractor would report a work force of seventy men when he actually hired
only fifty or sixty.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-020#95:1>
The difference in wages was presumably shared with the British
supervisor.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-020#96:1>
My maternal grandfather's house was across the road from Keppel
Shipyard in an area which is probably Telok Blangah now.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-020#97:1>
It was then a hill with a paved road leading to the hilltop, where
nice brick bungalows housed the yard's British staff.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-020#98:1>
My grandfather's house was the last one of a row of seven or eight
terrace houses on the slope.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-020#99:1>
The terrace house next door was leased to an Indian.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-020#100:1>
He must have been one of the contractors to Keppel Shipyard, for
every day at lunch time there would be thirty to forty Indian workers having
their lunch in front of the house.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-020#101:1>
They ate the same thing everyday: white rice with curry and a single
small potato.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-020#102:1>
The two-storey terrace house I moved into was a typical one of the
old days.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-020#103:1>
The entrance led directly into a living room, which in turn opened
out into an open atrium at the centre of the house.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-020#104:1>
On the other side of the atrium was a dining room, a kitchen and a
toilet.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-020#105:1>
My grandfather's household consisted of quite a number of people.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-020#106:1>
He had three wives, which was not unusual in those days.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-020#107:1>
His first wife, my grandmother, did not live there.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-020#108:1>
She had given birth to my mother in China, and then come to
Singapore, where she bore another girl, my aunt Yue Yi, fifteen years younger
than my mother.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-020#109:1>
My grandmother apparently could not stand the second wife's
bossiness, so she eventually left Singapore and returned to China.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-020#110:1>
This second wife, whom we called Small Grandmother, was a little fat
woman.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-020#111:1>
She was the mistress of the household.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-020#112:1>
The mere fact that she bore two sons, Ze Ling and Pak Ling,
naturally meant that she could usurp the first wife's place to assume the
role of mistress in the household. <X>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-020#X113:1>
The third wife, whom we called the Third Grandmother, was a tragic
figure and had no say whatsoever in the household, because she came from a
low status in society. </X> </I>
