<ICE-SIN:W2B-026#3:1>
The coral reefs of the Indo-West Pacific abound with numerous
beautiful and brightly coloured decapod crustaceans.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-026#4:1>
In recent years, there has been increasing interest in these
crustaceans by aquarium keepers.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-026#5:1>
Many small species are not only brightly coloured but also have
interesting habits.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-026#6:1>
One of the rarest possible acquisitions must surely be the bright-red
Indo-Pacific Furry Lobster, Palinurellus wieneckii ( De Man, 1881).

<ICE-SIN:W2B-026#7:1>
Palinurellus wieneckii is a small lobster by any standards.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-026#8:1>
Adults are not known to grow larger than 200 mm ( usually less than
100 mm) in total length, and have a stunning bright red colour all over.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-026#9:1>
The numerous short hairs covering its body give the animal its common
name of Furry Lobster, although in Hawaii, it is called the Mole Lobster (
probably because of its shape).

<ICE-SIN:W2B-026#10:1>
The Indo-Pacific Furry Lobster is quite rare but widely distributed
and has been recorded from many localities throughout the Indo-West Pacific.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-026#11:1>
Today, the Indo-Pacific Furry Lobster together with only two other
species ( Palinurellus gundlachi from the western Atlantic and Palibythis
magnificus from the central Pacific), are placed in the Synaxidae, a family
allied to the true spiny lobsters of the family Palinuridae.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-026#12:1>
In fact, in many books, Palinurellus is still classified with the
spiny lobsters in the Palinuridae.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-026#13:1>
The Indo-Pacific Furry Lobster was first described as Araeosternus
wieneckii by the great Dutch carcinologist J G De Man in 1881.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-026#14:1>
The species was named in honour of its collector, Mr Wieneck.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-026#15:1>
De Man thought that the species was so unusual and different from
typical spiny lobsters that he established a new genus for the species,
Araeosternus.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-026#16:1>
He even established a new subfamily for it, Araeosterninae.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-026#17:1>
Unfortunately, De Man did not know that a German carcinologist, E von
Martens had described a very similar looking animal ( which he named
Palinurellus gundlachi) from the western Atlantic three years earlier in 1878
which he named as a new genus and species, Palinurellus gundlachi.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-026#18:1>
De man, on learning about von Martens' species a year later, realised
that although his species, Araeosternus wieneckii was different from von
Martens' Palinurellus gundlachi, his genus Araeosternus was certainly the
same as Palinurellus.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-026#19:1>
By the rules of taxonomy, the genus name Palinurellus has priority
over Araeosternus, and De man dutifully transferred his species to the genus
Palinurellus.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-026#20:1>
De Man ( 1881) was right in recognising that his animal belonged to a
grouping distinct from typical spiny lobsters, hence his establishment of a
new subfamily, the Araeosterninae.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-026#21:1>
Unfortunately for De Man, he again lost credit for this discovery - -
by a mere four months!

<ICE-SIN:W2B-026#22:1>
In March 1881 the great English carcinologist, C S Bate, named a new
family, the Synaxidae, for an American lobster he also described as new,
Synaxes hybridica.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-026#23:1>
Bate's animal proved to be the same as von Martens' Palinurellus
gundlachi.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-026#24:1>
As von Martens' animal was named earlier ( 1878 vs 1881), the species
must be called Palinurellus gundlachi.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-026#25:1>
But the sometimes quirky rules of zoological nomenclature mandate
that the rules of priority also apply for family and subfamily names.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-026#26:1>
Bate recognised Palinurellus as a separate family ( Synaxidae) in
March 1881.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-026#27:1>
De Man recognised Palinurellus as a separate subfamily (
Araeosterninae) in July 1881.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-026#28:1>
Since the genus Palinurellus is today recognised as a distinct family
group by itself ( with the allied genus Palibythus), the earliest name used
must be applied for the group.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-026#29:1>
As a grouping of subfamily rank can be upgraded to full family status
( ie De Man's Araeosterninae becomes Araeosternidae), Synaxidae and
Araeosternidae technically denote the same grouping!

<ICE-SIN:W2B-026#30:1>
And Bate's Synaxidae is the earlier valid name by four months!

<ICE-SIN:W2B-026#31:1>
Palinurellus wieneckii was described from Pulau Tikus ( literally
translated from the Malay vernacular to mean Rat Island), an island off
Bengkulu, southwestern Sumatra.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-026#32:1>
It has since been reported from the Red Sea, South Africa, Mauritius,
Phuket ( Thailand), Ryukyus ( Japan), Philippines, Sumatra, Borneo, New
Guinea, Caroline Islands, New Caledonia, New Hebrides and Hawaii.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-026#33:1>
But few specimens are known.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-026#34:1>
The specimens figured here were obtained from an aquarium dealer who
said they were from the Philippines.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-026#35:1>
Larvae believed to be P wieneckii had been found in the Philippines
before, but no adults as yet have been collected.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-026#36:1>
Palinurellus wieneckii is quite unlike any spiny lobster species.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-026#37:1>
Not only does it differ in being smaller and more brightly coloured,
it also has much shorter antennae ( feelers) which are not spiny, and a less
cylindrical carapace ( shell) with a cristate lateral margin.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-026#38:1>
The body is also covered with a relatively thick coat of short hairs.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-026#39:1>
The long frontal horns ( adjacent to the eyes) of typical spiny
lobsters are also absent in Palinurellus.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-026#40:1>
Unlike spiny lobsters, members of the genus Palinurellus also have
biramous pleopods ( swimmerets) on the second abdominal male segment ( vs
uniramous).

<ICE-SIN:W2B-026#41:1>
The unusual features of Palinurellus and its only other known
relative, Palibythis, easily justify their placement in a separate family.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-026#42:1>
Typical spiny lobsters ( of gourmet fame) belong to several genera,
with Panulirus being the most common in this part of the world.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-026#43:1>
In Southeast Asian coral reefs colourful spiny lobster species like P
ornatus, P versicolour and P homarus abound.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-026#44:1>
The spiny lobster most common in the market and restaurants, is P
polyphagus, which is not a reef species.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-026#45:1>
Young specimens of these spiny lobsters ( especially P versicolour)
are often kept in aquaria as pets.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-026#46:1>
There are still some unresolved problems with the rare and poorly
known Indo-Pacific Furry Lobster.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-026#47:1>
One of these problems pertains to sexual differences.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-026#48:1>
Sexing lobsters is easy enough.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-026#49:1>
Male lobsters have their genital openings ( clearly visible in adults
as a translucent pore) on the base ( coxa) of the last ( fifth) leg.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-026#50:1>
In females, the genital openings are on the bases of the third pair
of legs.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-026#51:1>
According to L B Holthius, who has worked on lobsters extensively,
the type ( original) male specimen of P wieneckii has no pleopods on the
sternum of the first abdominal segment whereas female specimens do.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-026#52:1>
There have been reports, however, of the presence of a simple pleopod
on the first abdominal segment.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-026#53:1>
In the present specimens supposedly from the Philippines, the male
has no sign of pleopods on the first abdominal segment but the female has,
supporting Holthius' belief.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-026#54:1>
In the aquarium, Palinurellus wieneckii is a very peaceful and shy
species and can be kept easily with fish and other crustaceans without any
difficulty.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-026#55:1>
It hides under coral rocks during the day, and will feed on scraps of
fish and prawns.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-026#56:1>
It has been collected from gill nets from waters ranging from 9-27
metres deep, and believed to be mainly nocturnal.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-026#57:1>
Otherwise, biologists know almost nothing about the biology and
behaviour of this peculiar animal! </I>

<h> SCUBA DIVING: BEING IN A DIFFERENT WORLD </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-026#59:2>
L M CHOU

<ICE-SIN:W2B-026#60:2>
Man's desire to breathe and move about freely in the underwater
environment led to the invention of the aqualung in the 1940s.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-026#61:2>
Since then, constant technological improvement of the SCUBA ( Self
Contained Underwater Breathing Apparatus) equipment has enabled man to
conquer the watery medium, giving him the much appreciated freedom to move
about and remain underwater with a portable supply of air.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-026#62:2>
Upgrading and refinement of equipment have made scuba diving safe and
pleasant as a healthy sport.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-026#63:2>
While occasional accidents do occur, most result from human
carelessness and disrespect for safety procedures, rather than from equipment
failure.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-026#64:2>
Scuba has become an indispensable tool for the study of what goes on
in the mysterious world.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-026#65:2>
As a scuba diver and coral reef ecologist, I find myself in a job
which few can complain about.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-026#66:2>
Learning to scuba dive more than 12 years ago was more out of
necessity for the nature of my research, and there have been no regrets
since.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-026#67:2>
Looking at marine life in its own environment is a very satisfying
experience.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-026#68:2>
The satisfaction comes not only from the incredible beauty of the
plants and animals, but also from appreciating what it is like to live
underwater influenced by pressure and weightlessness.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-026#69:2>
The diver cannot help noticing the sudden transformation the moment
he plunges into the sea.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-026#70:2>
The ready welcome of the silent world is something quite
unforgettable, especially after kitting up in a small crowded boat with noise
and confusion reigning.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-026#71:2>
The hassle of struggling into the wet suit, donning heavy tanks,
checking equipment, clambering clumsily against all the weight to a vantage
point and balancing unsteadily before the final plunge, are all immediately
forgotten on breaking through the water's surface.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-026#72:2>
Once in, the diver quickly takes control and moves about with little
effort.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-026#73:2>
The weight of the equipment that threatens to drag the diver down is
miraculously gone.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-026#74:2>
Swimming through the water and listening to your own breathing and
the occasional clicking sounds of the marine organisms, the diver learns to
relax and enjoy the full leisure associated with diving.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-026#75:2>
The mind relaxes.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-026#76:2>
Stress becomes unknown.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-026#77:2>
The beauty of the colourful underwater life can be admired
unhurriedly and the feeling is only of great exhilaration.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-026#78:2>
Breathtaking sights await the diver, and coral reefs of the region do
offer the best attractions.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-026#79:2>
Fish and other marine life are abundant and diverse in these waters
and they make every dive interesting.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-026#80:2>
Having good well-maintained equipment is essential as they are the
only life-support systems in the watery depths.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-026#81:2>
Diving with an alert buddy is crucial and this basic rule should
never be ignored.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-026#82:2>
A personal experience has imprinted on me the importance of this
protocol.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-026#83:2>
Although my equipment was checked before the dive and had never been
known to malfunction, something happened to cause my air supply to run out
unnoticed after only 20 minutes.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-026#84:2>
Fortunately my buddy was there to provide sufficient air for the slow
decompression ascent.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-026#85:2>
When the equipment was sent for a complete check, nothing wrong was
found.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-026#86:2>
To date, there have been no further problems and I still do not know
what caused the air to run out so rapidly on that particular dive.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-026#87:2>
A second incident underscored the importance of a buddy.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-026#88:2>
During a dive at 20 m to study fish populations at artificial reefs,
I became too engrossed to check the time spent and the status of the air
supply and had to depend on my buddy during the ascent.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-026#89:2>
Research divers sometimes take unnecessary risks in order to complete
the final 10 meters of the survey transect or last few sectors of a permanent
quadrat.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-026#90:2>
These incidents showed me how helpless a diver is underwater without
functioning support systems.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-026#91:2>
It has however not discouraged me from continuing with this most
self-fulfilling activity and experiencing the joy of being close to nature in
its own realm. </I>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-026#92:3>
<h> The Tricky Tripletail Or " Gotta Pick a Patipok" </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-026#93:3>
This versatile fish lives in tropical and sub-tropical seas
worldwide, ranging throughout mid Atlantic, Pacific and Indian Oceans.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-026#94:3>
They are often found around buoys, floating debris and weed lines.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-026#95:3>
They also like to lurk around bottom structures like shipwrecks.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-026#96:3>
Tripletails are deep-bodied, perch-like fish ( they look like a cross
between a gourami and a talapia) with long, rounded anal and dorsal fins,
extending almost to the tail.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-026#97:3>
I first set eyes on this strange fish about 15-years ago when I
caught four whilst fishing over a wreck off Horsburgh Lighthouse.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-026#98:3>
Nobody on board knew its name so we decided to call it " Black
Seabass".

<ICE-SIN:W2B-026#99:3>
Strangely enough, I have never caught this fish at Horsburgh since.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-026#100:3>
About 7 years ago, my good fishing buddy, Zainal Azman, called me
sometime in early May.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-026#101:3>
" Hey Grant, the patipok season is about to start, why don't you get
some of your khakis and we can camp at Pulau Bidan and catch some off the
target buoys".

<ICE-SIN:W2B-026#102:3>
I had absolutely no idea what a patipok was and not wanting to sound
ignorant, I said " Sure, I'll be up next weekend - how big are they?".

<ICE-SIN:W2B-026#103:3>
" Oh, about 3-5 kgs", Azman replied.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-026#104:3>
As soon as I put the phone down, I called up several of my Malay
fishing friends in an attempt to find out what a patipok was - not one of
them knew what I was talking about. <X> One even asked jokingly " You're sure
it's not a currypok?" ( Malay curry-puff). </X> </I>
