<h> Searching For Singapore's National Values </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-012#3:1>
Jon S T Quah

<ICE-SIN:W2A-012#4:1>
The purpose of this concluding chapter is twofold.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-012#5:1>
First, we will evaluate the suitability of the four core values
identified in President Wee Kim Wee's address at the opening of the Seventh
Parliament as national values by discussing the implications involved in
their implementation.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-012#6:1>
Second, we will then proceed to suggest a set of national values which
we hope will be acceptable to all Singaporeans, including not only a
modification of some of the four core values, but also two other values which
have not been stressed so far.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-012#7:1>
Needless to say, it is not possible for us to provide a comprehensive
list of all the required national values in this chapter.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-012#8:1>
Nor would it be wise for us to do so, as such a long list would be
unwieldy and distract our attention from focusing on the key values.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-012#9:1>
Accordingly, we have deliberately restricted our focus to six national
values, which will help Singaporeans and their government to strengthen their
national identity as well as preserve the cultural heritage of the different
communities.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-012#10:1>
<h> THE FOUR CORE VALUES </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-012#11:1>
In his speech to the members of the Alumni International Singapore on
11 January 1989, Brigadier-General ( BG) Lee Hsien Loong, the Minister for
Trade and Industry, presented his personal views on the national ideology
debate and elaborated on the four core values identified in the presidential
address to parliament.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-012#12:1>
The four core values are:

<ICE-SIN:W2A-012#13:1>
( l) Community over self;

<ICE-SIN:W2A-012#14:1>
( 2) Upholding the family as the basic building block of society;

<ICE-SIN:W2A-012#15:1>
( 3) Resolving major issues through consensus instead of contention;

<ICE-SIN:W2A-012#16:1>
( 4) Stressing racial and religious tolerance and harmony.1 BG Lee
asserted that these four values, which are the key values, " provide an
adequate starting point for a National Ideology" because " they are
compatible with Chinese, Malay, and Indian cultures, and with the values
taught by the major religions".

<ICE-SIN:W2A-012#17:1>
2) Indeed, these four values provide a useful basis for further
discussion among Singaporeans regarding the components of the national
ideology.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-012#18:1>
Several important qualifications made by him regarding these values
should be noted.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-012#19:1>
The first point of view to bear in mind is that the national ideology
is " the characteristic ethos and spirit of a people" and consists of the
core values which the community shares, and which distinguishes them from
other peoples and countries".

<ICE-SIN:W2A-012#20:1>
3) In other words, the set of national values which we will identify
for Singapore should, as far as possible, distinguish Singaporeans from the
citizens of other countries.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-012#21:1>
The second qualification mentioned by BG Lee is that the national
values should be non-political and non-religious in nature and should
consist of those personal values which Singaporeans must espouse to ensure
national unity.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-012#22:1>
Thirdly, he suggested a " conservative but not unquestioning
approach" in shaping the desired national values for Singapore: " retain our
own heritages, but examine them for values which need to be modified, and
scrutinize foreign traditions for ideas which can be incorporated, but do so
cautiously".

<ICE-SIN:W2A-012#23:1>
A fourth qualification is that while the national values should be
universal and not particularistic in nature, the set of national values to be
adopted for Singapore should, nevertheless, reflect our special
circumstances.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-012#24:1>
Finally, the list of national values should be kept to the minimum so
that we can focus on the key items.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-012#25:1>
<h> 4) EVALUATION OF THE FOUR CORE VALUES </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-012#26:1>
In general, the four core values are accepted either in toto or with
some modification by the various groups which have made submissions to the
government.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-012#27:1>
We will discuss the suitability of these four values as national
values in turn.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-012#28:1>
<h> Community over Self </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-012#29:1>
According to BG Lee, Oriental and Western societies differ in terms
of the relative importance of the individual and the group.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-012#30:1>
" In general, Western societies place more weight on the individual,
while Oriental societies tend to place more weight on the group."

<ICE-SIN:W2A-012#31:1>
5) In the same vein, George C. Lodge has contrasted the two " ideal
types" of " individualism" and " communitarianism" in the following manner:

<ICE-SIN:W2A-012#32:1>
Individualism suggests an atomistic conception of society, one in
which the individual is the ultimate source of value and meaning.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-012#33:1>
The interests of the community are defined and achieved by
self-interested competition among many, preferably small, proprietors.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-012#34:1>
Communitarianism, however, takes a more organic view, regarding the
community as more than the sum of its individuals and requiring explicit
definition of its needs and priorities.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-012#35:1>
6) The need for stressing communitarianism or community above self as
one of the four core values is understandable in view of the excessive focus
on individualism in Singapore.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-012#36:1>
Indeed, individualism has been emphasized usually at the expense of
communitarianism.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-012#37:1>
For example, the system of meritocracy has, undoubtedly, contributed
to the importance of education as a channel for upward social mobility in
Singapore and the selection and promotion of the " best and brightest" in the
public sector.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-012#38:1>
However, the focus on doing well in examinations, the emphasis on
paper qualifications, and the special treatment given to the " scholar" civil
servants have certainly reinforced the appeal of individualism among
Singaporeans.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-012#39:1>
Another negative consequence of the " paper chase" has been the
unhealthy dependence on private tuition and the spawning of a lucrative
private tuition industry in Singapore.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-012#40:1>
Hence, the problem is not simply that of displacing individualism
with communitarianism, which would be quite a difficult task to achieve
anyhow, especially in the short run.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-012#41:1>
Rather, the solution seems to be the attainment of an equilibrium
between individual and community interests.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-012#42:1>
It would indeed be unrealistic at the present moment to expect
pragmatic Singaporeans to change their individualistic behaviour overnight,
especially when the reward system is still based on individualism rather than
communitarianism.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-012#43:1>
Accordingly, we propose that the core value of " community over self'
should be modified to " harmony or balance between individual and community
interests" as this value would be more feasible in the short run.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-012#44:1>
The value of " community over self" can only be attained in the long
run after the reward system has been correspondingly modified to stress the
importance communitarianism over individualism.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-012#45:1>
<h> The Family as the Basic Institution </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-012#46:1>
In their study, The Family in Various Cultures, Stuart A. Queen,
Robert W. Habenstein and Jill S. Quadagno found, among other things, that the
family is an important institution which performs four universal functions in
various cultures, namely, procreation, orientation, division of labour
between the sexes, and status giving.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-012#47:1>
7) A more recent international study of seven countries has shown
that " the family ( whatever its form) remains a rather important aspect in
the life of individuals and of the community".

<ICE-SIN:W2A-012#48:1>
8) Given the universal importance of the family, care must be taken
when highlighting this core value to ensure that the government is not
perceived by the minority groups to be only promoting the Confucian model of
the family as this will not be acceptable to the non-Chinese Singaporeans.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-012#49:1>
It is quite easy to make the mistake of stressing Confucian family
values only specially when three-quarters of the population is of Chinese
descent.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-012#50:1>
The temptation to do so must be strenuously resisted otherwise this
core value would cause a wedge not only between the Chinese and non-Chinese
Singaporeans, but also among Chinese Singaporeans themselves.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-012#51:1>
Its utility as an unifying factor among Singaporeans would thereby be
diminished.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-012#52:1>
Indeed, the various communities in Singapore consider the family as
an important institution.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-012#53:1>
For example, the joint ( Ad Hoc) Committee of Muslim Organizations (
JCMO) supported this core value in its " Communique on National Ideology":

<ICE-SIN:W2A-012#54:1>
We agree that the family is a fundamental unit of society.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-012#55:1>
A happy, orderly and stable family unit is a prerequisite for a sound
and stable society.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-012#56:1>
9) Similarly, the Tamils Representative Council ( TRC) also accepts
this core value of the family as a basic institution of society.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-012#57:1>
In its " Submission on Core Values and National Ideology", the TRC
outlined its stand on the family thus:

<ICE-SIN:W2A-012#58:1>
The family is the most fundamental social institution of the Tamil
society.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-012#59:1>
It occupies a very important position as the intermediate point
between the individual and the larger society....

<ICE-SIN:W2A-012#60:1>
The Family is also the bearer of virtues, values and social
reputation; for a man's reputation or status in society is linked to that of
his family and to his own behaviour.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-012#61:1>
10) The Eurasians also support this core value, which is part of
their way of life.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-012#62:1>
According to Victor F Olsen, President of the Eurasian Association in
Singapore: We are convinced that the family unit is the core of any civilized
society.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-012#63:1>
It is the social network to which the individual belongs.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-012#64:1>
It is the support base from which the individual draws strength in
order to develop and excel and/or seek refuge and solace in difficult times.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-012#65:1>
The Eurasian community is extremely family-oriented.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-012#66:1>
Most of our community activities involve and revolve around all
generations of the family and it also extends to include all relatives who
may or may not even be Eurasians.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-012#67:1>
It is interesting to note that the important role played by the
family in nation-building was pointed out long ago by the Greek philosopher,
Aristotle, in his classic book, Politics.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-012#68:1>
In Book 1, Chapter 2 of Politics, Aristotle wrote:

<ICE-SIN:W2A-012#69:1>
The family is the association established by nature for the supply of
men's everyday wants, ....

<ICE-SIN:W2A-012#70:1>
But when several families are united, and the association aims at
something more than the supply of daily needs, then comes into existence the
village.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-012#71:1>
When several villages are united in a single community, perfect and
large enough to be nearly or quite self-sufficing, the state comes into
existence, originating in the bare needs of life, and continuing in existence
for the sake of a good life.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-012#72:1>
In the Singapore context, the family's important role in
nation-building will be enhanced by promoting the core value of the family as
the basic institution in society.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-012#73:1>
However, as pointed out by BG Lee, the importance of family ties
should not deteriorate into nepotism, given our tradition of clean and honest
government.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-012#74:1>
<h> Solving Problems by Consensus, not Contention </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-012#75:1>
This core value implies that the incumbent government should rely on
consensus and not contention to solve problems facing the country.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-012#76:1>
There is a great deal of conceptual confusion among social scientists
regarding the meaning of " consensus".

<ICE-SIN:W2A-012#77:1>
13) For our purposes, we will simply define consensus as " shared
public agreement" among Singaporeans.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-012#78:1>
The first assumption underlying this value is that it is possible for
the government to avoid contention or conflict in dealing with national
problems.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-012#79:1>
This assumption appears to be unrealistic as it is not always
possible to avoid contention or conflict when controversial policies or
issues are being discussed.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-012#80:1>
Nevertheless, the government and groups in society should not resort
to violence or force to impose their views on the populace if they wish to
solve problems by consensus.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-012#81:1>
To govern by consensus also assumes that the government is willing to
listen to the population and to consult them when formulating major public
policies.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-012#82:1>
The shift in leadership style of the political leaders from a
paternalistic style ( 1959-84) to a consultative style ( after 1984) will be
conducive for the promotion of this core value.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-012#83:1>
However, these leaders should realize that one consequence of
governing by consensus is that it requires time and that they would not be
able to formulate and implement public policies as swiftly as they had done
so before.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-012#84:1>
It should also be stressed that this core value should not undermine
the role of opposition political parties in Singapore.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-012#85:1>
Indeed, in a democratic political system, opposition parties play a
valuable role when they are constructive in their criticism of government
policies and when they provide a credible alternative to the incumbent
government.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-012#86:1>
At the same time, however, the government must not ignore or neglect
the demands made by various groups and their adverse reactions to public
policies.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-012#87:1>
Rather, the government should assess objectively whether such demands
are legitimate or not, and also ascertain the reasons for the negative
responses to its policies.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-012#88:1>
Care must also be taken by the government to ensure that it does not
silence constructive dissent when it governs by consensus. <X>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-012#X89:1>
If constructive dissent is discouraged or penalized by the
government, Singaporeans will perceive the promotion of this core value as an
attempt to perpetuate PAP rule.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-012#X90:1>
Finally, to govern by consensus and not contention, the government
has to consult Singaporeans when it wishes to formulate important policies.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-012#X91:1>
For this method of government to work, two pre-conditions must be
satisfied.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-012#X92:1>
First, all Singaporeans, especially those who can contribute, should
come forward and provide constructive and honest feedback on government
policies as well as suggestions for improving such policies.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-012#X93:1>
In addition to such channels as the forum page in the press and the
Feedback Unit, the government has recently referred new parliamentary bills
to select committees in order to give Singaporeans the opportunity to air
their views on the proposed legislation.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-012#X94:1>
If Singaporeans fail to play an active role in the consultative
process, they cannot blame the government for not consulting them as they
have not made full use of the opportunities given to them.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-012#X95:1>
Second, the government must take the exercise of consulting the
people seriously.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-012#X96:1>
It must not be perceived by Singaporeans merely to be paying lip
service to consultation and dismissing feedback provided especially if such
feedback is negative.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-012#X97:1>
One of the survey findings reported by Chiew Seen Kong in Chapter 5
indicates that the majority of the respondents want to be consulted by the
government before policies are made but their perception is that the
government has not done so.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-012#X98:1>
The political leaders should take note of constructive suggestions
on how to improve existing policies or to modify policy proposals before
these are implemented.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-012#X99:1>
Furthermore, dissenting views should not be rejected outright and
without a thorough examination of their strengths and weaknesses.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-012#X100:1>
If there is overwhelming public opposition or resistance to a new
policy, the PAP leaders should attempt to ascertain the reasons for such
dissatisfaction, and either modify its contents or re-examine the need for
such a policy in the first place.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-012#X101:1>
<h> Racial and Religious Tolerance and Harmony </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-012#X102:1>
In a multi-racial society like Singapore, the need for racial and
religious tolerance and harmony is axiomatic for without it, there would be
racial and religious conflict, which would spell disaster for us.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-012#X103:1>
While the communal threat is not serious in Singapore today given
the absence of communal riots over the last two decades, it should not be
forgotten that the road to nation building is a long and arduous one, and
along the way - many things can happen which can hinder progress.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-012#X104:1>
No plural society like Singapore can be immunized from the threat
of racial riots; but such a threat can be minimized if not eliminated when
there is also a strong sense of national identity to reinforce the racial
harmony that already exists in Singapore.15 At the same time, the feedback on
this core value from various quarters has also stressed the need for
understanding between the different races and religions in Singapore.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-012#X105:1>
Indeed, this value is the most important of all the four core
values because it enables us to distinguish Singapore from Hong Kong, Japan,
South Korea and Taiwan, which are basically more homogeneous societies.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-012#X106:1>
Moreover, the institutionalization of this value will help to
minimize the potential for racial and religious conflict in Singapore.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-012#X107:1>
The feedback on this core value also indicates that racial and
religious tolerance and harmony are certainly very important in multi-racial
Singapore.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-012#X108:1>
However, many people feel that what is even more important is
understanding between the different races and religions.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-012#X109:1>
If there is genuine understanding among the various ethnic and
religious groups in Singapore, the likelihood of conflict among them would be
reduced considerably.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-012#X110:1>
Thus, it is very important that such understanding between these
groups be enhanced.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-012#X111:1>
Since the hallmark of a multi-racial society depends on how the
minority groups are treated, the government should ensure that its policies
do not discriminate against such groups.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-012#X112:1>
The existence of the Presidential Council for Minority Rights and
the meritocratic system in the public bureaucracy serve to minimize racial
discrimination in the public sector.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-012#X113:1>
On the other hand, much more effort needs to be made to reduce
racial and other forms of discrimination in the private sector.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-012#X114:1>
If minority groups feel unwanted and suffer from discrimination,
they would not hesitate to leave Singapore, and many of them, especially the
Indians and Eurasians, have already done so.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-012#X115:1>
The recent White Paper on Maintenance of Religious Harmony
highlights the need to ensure that the various religions in Singapore, while
enjoying freedom of worship, respect each others' rights and do not attempt
to convert members of other religions.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-012#X116:1>
The rationale for the new proposals was clearly stated in the White
Paper: Singaporeans belong to different races, languages and religions....

<ICE-SIN:W2A-012#X117:1>
In such a context, religious and racial harmony are not just
desirable ideals to be achieved, but essential conditions for our survival as
one nation....

<ICE-SIN:W2A-012#X118:1>
We therefore cannot assume that religious harmony will persist
indefinitely as a matter of course....

<ICE-SIN:W2A-012#X119:1>
Two vital conditions must therefore be observed to maintain
harmony.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-012#X120:1>
Firstly, followers of the different religions must exercise
moderation and tolerance, and do nothing to cause religious enmity or hatred.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-012#X121:1>
Secondly, religion and politics must be kept rigorously
separated.16 In short, understanding, tolerance and harmony between the
different races and religions in Singapore is a sine qua non for its survival
as a nation.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-012#X122:1>
Singapore's rapid economic growth during the post-independence
period has been the result of its political stability, which can be
attributed in turn to the absence of racial or religious conflict during the
last 20 years.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-012#X123:1>
Indeed, the absence of such conflict in recent years should not
make us complacent or forget about the fragility of our racial and religious
harmony.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-012#X124:1>
On the contrary, steps should be taken by the government and all
Singaporeans to increase further the understanding, tolerance and harmony
between the various races and religious groups in Singapore. </X> </I>
