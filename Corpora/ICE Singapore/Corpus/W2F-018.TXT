<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#1:1>
The tropical thunderstorm had stopped as suddenly it had begun,
petering out into a light grey drizzle that fell continuously all afternoon.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#2:1>
The dark trunk road, that ran from Taiping to Ipoh, cut through the
plantations of straight rows of rubber trees, dripping with the wet.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#3:1>
On the right of the village lay the railway, and on the left, the
rubber plantations stretched as far as the eye could see, stopping abruptly
at the edge of the tin mines and the slopes of the secondary jungle.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#4:1>
Beyond this rose the mountains of the Main Range, jutting thousands of
feet into the grey wet skies.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#5:1>
The farm lay at the edge of a plantation.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#6:1>
Everything in the wooden farmhouse smelt damp because of the rain.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#7:1>
Seventeen-year-old Pang Yoke-lin lay among the crumpled sheets of the
four-poster bed, moaning softly.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#8:1>
A thin frail-looking girl, her face was bathed in sweat.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#9:1>
The child inside her was due, and yet it was reluctant to emerge.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#10:1>
She could feel it struggling and straining inside her, no longer a
part of her, but something foreign with a will of its own.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#11:1>
Her muscles were becoming tighter, and more and more taut with each
new cycle of pain.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#12:1>
The veins in her legs were swelling with the strain and she bit her
lips as yet another wave of pain ripped through her pelvic region.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#13:1>
" Stop crying and push.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#14:1>
Push!" First Aunt hissed in her ear.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#15:1>
Yoke-lin was breathing hard.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#16:1>
She wanted to push the life out of her womb - get rid of it and hurl
it into the laps of the Chows!

<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#17:1>
She pushed and pushed at the urging of First Aunt till all that was
loving, tender and affectionate was forced out of her heart.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#18:1>
Night came.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#19:1>
From her bed in that tiny bedroom of the farmhouse, Yoke-lin saw the
hard profile of her mother-in-law.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#20:1>
The coarse hands of thc farm woman were lighting a pair of red
candles on the altar of her Hakka ancestors.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#21:1>
Softly intoning their names, she called their spirits home to witness
the birth of the family's first grandchild.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#22:1>
The father-in-law, Old Chow, his weather-beaten face creased with
worry, silently took down the kerosene lamp he reserved for festive
occasions.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#23:1>
He was concerned over the unusually long labour.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#24:1>
Why was his grandson so reluctant to be born?

<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#25:1>
Unconcerned about the mother, he feared that the long hours of strain
might harm the baby.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#26:1>
He lit the lamp and pumped it till the room was bright as daylight.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#27:1>
It was a good omen, and a good thing too that he had bought the lamp.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#28:1>
The village was newly established by the British forces, and it had
no electricity yet.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#29:1>
" Government people, phui!" he spat, dismissing the officials'
promise of a better life in these well-guarded New Villages established under
the Emergency.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#30:1>
What had that got to do with him?

<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#31:1>
He was a farmer.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#32:1>
All he wanted was to be left in peace to grow his crops and rear his
fowl.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#33:1>
He strode into his daughter-in-law's bedroom and hung the lamp from a
beam of the ceiling.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#34:1>
Then he closed the room's only window, shutting out the black night.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#35:1>
Like all peasants, he was superstitious - no one could tell what evil
spirits might lurk out there, ready to harm the newborn.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#36:1>
The room was warm and bright.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#37:1>
First Aunt bustled in, pushed Yoke-lin to one side of the bed and
began lining it with cheap absorbent paper.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#38:1>
" The baby is due.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#39:1>
I'll fetch the hot water".

<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#40:1>


<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#41:1>
Unable to bear her pain any longer, Yoke-lin let out a groan, then
another and another, louder and louder.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#42:1>
The pain in her loins was excruciating.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#43:1>
" Open your legs.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#44:1>
Wider, ah!

<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#45:1>
Wider!" her mother-in-law leant over her.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#46:1>
" Hold your breath.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#47:1>
Don't scream"!

<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#48:1>
" Remember, the medium said don't let out too much air!" First Aunt
cautioned her.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#49:1>
Yoke-lin gritted her teeth and tried not to make a sound, grasping
the bed's headboard till her knuckles went white.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#50:1>
" I can see his head!

<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#51:1>
Push, push!" First Aunt cried.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#52:1>
" Harder!

<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#53:1>
Harder!" urged the mother-in-law.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#54:1>
" He's coming!" Yoke-lin obeyed with anger, frustration and despair.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#55:1>
" Aiya, where's Ah Chong?

<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#56:1>
Has anyone looked for him?

<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#57:1>
A father to be and he's not home yet!" the mother-in-law complained.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#58:1>
" You go, sister-in-law, you go.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#59:1>
I'll look after her,' said First Aunt.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#60:1>
Yoke-lin shut her eyes.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#61:1>
She strained with all her strength like one pushing out her last
breath, her soul and all the sinews of her heart, pushing out that part of
her body which had been defiled.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#62:1>
Soiled and defiled!

<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#63:1>
Her eyes choked with angry tears.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#64:1>
Cry after cry of rage escaped from her.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#65:1>
She pushed until she thought her bones would crack.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#66:1>
What did that man care?

<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#67:1>
Night after night, he had shoved her on to the bed, planted his seed
and left.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#68:1>
He did what his father ordered him to do and that was that!

<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#69:1>
In their old age, fearing the end of their line, Old Chow and his
wife had wanted a grandchild quickly.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#70:1>
But their only child, Ah Chong, was more interested in " playing
politics" than in marriage, the villagers said.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#71:1>
Old Chow, a violent man, had had to box his ears on the wedding
night.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#72:1>
" Go in and do it!" Old Chow had roared.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#73:1>
" I paid two hundred for her, you know or not!

<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#74:1>
I want a return.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#75:1>
You hear me"?

<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#76:1>
The whole village heard him.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#77:1>
For days afterwards, the villagers talked of nothing else but Ah
Chong and his bride.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#78:1>
" Have you done it?" the farmers guffawed.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#79:1>
The baby was coming.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#80:1>
Yoke-lin could feel something tearing through her.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#81:1>
" Push, push!" Her mother-in-law held her legs.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#82:1>
" Push!

<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#83:1>
With all your strength!

<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#84:1>
Push!" First Aunt held her thrashing arms.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#85:1>
She was being torn apart.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#86:1>
A long animal howl escaped from her as she shut her eyes and let the
darkness slowly flood over her.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#87:1>
When she opened her eyes again, the room was bright and warm, the air
damp with the smell of blood, and the papers under her were sodden wet.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#88:1>
Pale and worn out, she could feel the sweat of labour flowing
unchecked, soaking her sarong and the sheets beneath her.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#89:1>
She lay back, exhausted.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#90:1>
" Aiya, no good, no good, a girl!" First Aunt was bending over her,
looking distressed.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#91:1>
The two of them stared at the pink bundle in her arms.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#92:1>
The father-in-law strode into the room.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#93:1>
Without a word, he unhooked the kerosene lamp and extinguished it,
plunging all of them into darkness.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#94:1>
Hours later, old Mrs Chow snuffed out the red candles, leaving only
the oil lamp burning.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#95:1>
The room was filled with shadows while outside, scattered dots of
light showed the houses of the villagers.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#96:1>
A warm breeze brought the foul smell of pigs' swill and manure.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#97:1>
The heavy peasant woman let out a sigh and sat down on the earthen
step of the doorway.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#98:1>
" It's fate.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#99:1>
What else but fate," she muttered, trying to explain the
incomprehensible to herself.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#100:1>
" I did everything; saved the money for the bride, took her to the
temple, made the son marry her and prayed to the ancestors, day and night".

<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#101:1>
" The girl's young.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#102:1>
More grandchildren to come, maybe a son next year," First Aunt
consoled her.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#103:1>
" Aiya, that's my prayer.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#104:1>
My old mother had sons.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#105:1>
No pain, no difficulty.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#106:1>
They dropped out of her like piglets, ah.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#107:1>
Six boys, eight girls, one each year.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#108:1>
All lived.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#109:1>
Fifth Brother was born in the rice field.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#110:1>
Ma bit off his cord with her own teeth!

<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#111:1>
Born in the open, and yet he lived.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#112:1>
But mine, they die!

<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#113:1>
We Chows are cursed"!

<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#114:1>
" Choy!

<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#115:1>
Choy!" First Aunt exclaimed.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#116:1>
" Ah Chong will give you many grandsons yet.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#117:1>
Where's Old Chow?" " Gone to look for Ah Chong"

<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#118:1>
" The guards are so strict, they won't open the gates so late".

<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#119:1>
" I could see from his face," Mrs Chow continued, " Ah Chong's
father was bitter.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#120:1>
I thought he was going to slap Yoke-lin"!

<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#121:1>
" A girl!

<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#122:1>
In my village in China they threw girls into the river," said First
Aunt.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#123:1>
" In our village, Ma said that the fathers pressed their girl babies
into the mud"!

<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#124:1>
And in her bedroom, Yoke-lin was sobbing quietly.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#125:1>
She was a failure.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#126:1>
During her twelve months in this Hakka household, the man who gave
her this child had come and gone without a word.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#127:1>
Sometimes, he was gone for days, and his mother would scold and
blame her, saying she was a useless piece of wood, unable to hold on to the
man she had married.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#128:1>
What could she do?

<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#129:1>
They never spoke.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#130:1>
He came to her only when he was drunk.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#131:1>
The few times that he had shown any interest in her, she was already
big and clumsy with child, and he merely gave her some extra food to eat.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#132:1>
Most of the time, they were strangers, doing what they had to.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#133:1>
But their child now lay sleeping by her side, the pink little face
puckering up in tiny wrinkles.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#134:1>
She had thought that this marriage would free her from being trapped
in a fate like her mother's.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#135:1>
Her mother - poor, illiterate, ignorant and stupid had lived with
one man after another, dragging her brood of girls from small town to small
town: Kulim, Bukit Mertajam, Batu Gajah, Telok Anson, an endless drabness in
dim wooden huts upon which the rains pelted mercilessly and water dripped
into rusty tins.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#136:1>
Always on the move, always poor and in debt, never knowing when
someone would buy them a meal, she grew up believing that a proper marriage
was security.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#137:1>
Outside her bedroom the two older women were sill whispering, their
voices low and anxious as they waited for their men folk to return.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#138:1>
With the Emergency curfew it was not safe to walk about at night.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#139:1>
First Aunt came into the room.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#140:1>
" Sleep," she ordered Yoke-lin.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#141:1>
" After labour must rest.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#142:1>
Boy or girl, you rest".

<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#143:1>
Yoke-lin's eyes filled with tears at this bit of kindness.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#144:1>
Her own mother had not been so lucky.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#145:1>
The trishaw rider with whom she had lived for many years had killed
her when she gave birth to her sixth daughter.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#146:1>
His face red with drink, he had raged like a mad bull because the
baby was not the son he expected.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#147:1>
He pulled her mother by the hair and dragged the still bleeding
woman from her bed, slapping and punching her.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#148:1>
Something was wrong with her body that could not produce a son.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#149:1>
Again and again, he banged her head against the wall.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#150:1>
His ancestors' graves were cold and it was her fault.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#151:1>
Finally, her mother had collapsed.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#152:1>
The children huddled under the table, wailing.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#153:1>
That night, the sounds of pain from that tormented, writhing body on
the floor had bewildered them.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#154:1>
By morning their mother had bled to death.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#155:1>
Yoke-lin, at the age of eight, became an orphan.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#156:1>
The baby on the bed let out a lusty wail.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#157:1>
Yoke-lin awoke with a start and gathered her baby daughter into her
arms.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#158:1>
The farmhouse seemed full of angry people speaking in loud staccato
Hakka.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#159:1>
" The fool!

<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#160:1>
He's already dead!"

<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#161:1>
Old Chow's voice rose above the din.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#162:1>
" Let the horse-face guards shoot him!

<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#163:1>
I have no son"!

<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#164:1>


<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#165:1>
" Choy!

<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#166:1>
Choy!

<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#167:1>
How can?

<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#168:1>
Your one and only son!" the women gasped.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#169:1>
" What d'you want me do, ha?

<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#170:1>
If not the soldiers now, it'll be the communists later!

<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#171:1>
You think once inside, they'll let him come back to us?" Old Chow
asked, exasperated by the events.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#172:1>
" Heaven, hear me, a poor mother!

<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#173:1>
What wrong did I do that you punish me like this?

<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#174:1>
I kowtow from temple to temple, and still I suffer like this"?

<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#175:1>


<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#176:1>
Old Mrs Chow knocked her head on the altar so violently that the
ancestral tablets rattled.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#177:1>
" Sister-in-law, Ah Chong's mother, don't cry so.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#178:1>
Not your fault.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#179:1>
No one said you did wrong".

<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#180:1>
First Aunt's voice rose and fell as more and more relations crowded
into the farmhouse to have their say.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#181:1>
Because all were from the same clan, the same village, or related by
marriage, each felt he had a right to comment and advise the Chows on what to
do. <X>

<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#X182:1>
This was a family matter.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#X183:1>
A crisis had occurred, and the family must come together, to talk
things over, to confer and decide on the best course of action to take.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-018#X184:1>
Such things, however, often lead to the teeth biting the tongue,
the old Chinese used to say, for no matter how close the family, members are
bound to argue and quarrel at such times. </X> </I>
