<h> Making connections What to look for when buying a modem </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-034#3:1>
When buying a modem, you need to consider features like the
transmission speed, standards and reliability.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-034#4:1>
Speed or baud rate refers to the speed at which data in bits are
transmitted per second.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-034#5:1>
The slowest is the 1200 bps modem and the fastest is 14,400 bps.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-034#6:1>
As a rough guide, at 1200 bps, transmitting an A4 page of text takes
about 40 seconds; 20 seconds with a 2400 bps modem; five with a 9600 bps
modem; and just two seconds flat at 14,400 bps.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-034#7:1>
Things could he speeded up if the document is compressed to a fraction
of its size.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-034#8:1>
Or slowed down by the modem's error-correction facilities which
detects transmission errors and automatically orders a re-transmission, which
could double or treble the transmission time.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-034#9:1>
<h> Standards </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-034#10:1>
There are two worldwide standards for modems.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-034#11:1>
One is CCITT ( Comite Consultatif International Telephonique) and the
other MNP ( Microcom Network Protocol).

<ICE-SIN:W2B-034#12:1>
For simple data transmission you will need a modem that is built to
comply with CCITT V.21 ( 1200 bps) or CCITT V.22bis ( 2400 bps).

<ICE-SIN:W2B-034#13:1>
For faxmodems, CCITT V.27 means that it is a fax modem and faxes are
sent at 4800 bps while data is at 2400 bps.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-034#14:1>
CCITT V.29 tells you that the modem will fax at 9600 bps and transmit
data at 7200 bps.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-034#15:1>
The latest standard in error correction is MNP 5 that has a data
compression rate of 2:1.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-034#16:1>
That means data are first compressed to half its original size before
transmitting.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-034#17:1>
If the modem also complies with CCITT V.42bis, data compression is
4:1.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-034#18:1>
But note that for all that to happen, both the sending and receiving
modems must comply with the same standards.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-034#19:1>
<h> Internal or external? </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-034#20:1>
An external modem has a row of lights that keep the user informed of
the status of transmission.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-034#21:1>
It is connected to the computer through a cable.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-034#22:1>
The external modem can also be switched from one computer to another.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-034#23:1>
Pocketable modems, about the size of a chocolate bar, are especially
good for this as they have features as the desktop modems and are portable.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-034#24:1>
For example, a user can unplug one from the office computer for use
on his home computer over the weekend.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-034#25:1>
An internal modem is a bare printed circuit board with all the
components visible and is fitted inside the computer.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-034#26:1>
It is simple to install and does not add to cables and devices
attached to the computer.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-034#27:1>
However, it takes up a valuable slot space that may be needed for
other card-devices like a Windows Accelerator or Network card.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-034#28:1>
Also, it adds to the heat generated from the electronics inside.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-034#29:1>
<h> Fax modems </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-034#30:1>
These allow you to fax computer generated documents along with any
graphics without having to print it out first, a boon when on the road.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-034#31:1>
Fax modems cost as little as
&dollar;300, about half the price of most basic desktop fax machines.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-034#32:1>
They also come with background sending and receiving features.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-034#33:1>
That means faxes can be received and automatically stored or sent as
soon as the fax line is free.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-034#34:1>
Imagine being able to read a proposal, add in some amendments and
then send them simultaneously to the legal, advertising and managing
director, all with a few keystrokes. </I>

<h> Microsoft's Database for non-programmers No computer degree
required for effective use </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-034#36:2>
By YEONG AH SENG

<ICE-SIN:W2B-034#37:2>
Microsoft's Access is the latest relational database program to enter
an already crowded market.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-034#38:2>
Priced at an aggressive
&dollar;199 ( introductory offer only), it is likely to give cause for worry to
rivals like Borland.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-034#39:2>
Like all other Microsoft products, setting up Access is easy.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-034#40:2>
Just insert " Disk One" into the disk drive and activate " SETUP.EXE"
from the program manager and follow the instructions after that.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-034#41:2>
A complete installation took up 15 megabytes of disk space, which is
typical of most Windows programs.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-034#42:2>
Access, unlike other database programs, manages the separate files
that makes up a database system into a group.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-034#43:2>
Instead of using cryptic names like " seta.idx" and " seta.dbf",
Access allows you to use plain English to describe your database; files like
" Students" and " Grades".

<ICE-SIN:W2B-034#44:2>
This is a very useful feature as it simplifies developing database
systems.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-034#45:2>
Having set up the database, Access lets you enter information in a
columnar format.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-034#46:2>
In this view, it is pretty much like a spreadsheet, allowing you to
resize the columns to view more information.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-034#47:2>
What is missing, however, is the ability to resize columns to the
optimum size.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-034#48:2>
Microsoft should have included this feature like they did in Excel
4.0.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-034#49:2>
You can also create custom forms for data entry.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-034#50:2>
Microsoft has included a very nice built-in utility to let you create
great looking forms quickly and easily.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-034#51:2>
Access also provides buttons for browsing records.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-034#52:2>
The buttons are, however, too small and too spaced apart to be
conveniently used.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-034#53:2>
The query feature is good but rather awkward to use.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-034#54:2>
I had to save the query first in order to change it.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-034#55:2>
What Microsoft could have done is to implement a split window to
allow the user to simultaneously view the query and the result together at
the same time.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-034#56:2>
I usually make more than one query at a time, so it was rather
inconvenient.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-034#57:2>
Access was somewhat sluggish on my 4 MB 386/25 with a Quantum 105 Mb
IDE hard disk and frequently accesses the hard disk.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-034#58:2>
Access is a good database product with very neat features like Cue
Cards to guide me in my database creation and usage.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-034#59:2>
Relating databases was just a matter of clicking and dragging the
primary field of one table to another.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-034#60:2>
Forms can also be created to view information from related tables
simultaneously.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-034#61:2>
The program also lets you create macros and programs to automate your
databases.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-034#62:2>
Overall, I find that Access is useful and promising program, if
Microsoft will trim it down a little to make it faster; make use of more "
checkboxes" than " drop menus" to make it easier to change field types and
give more thought to the user interface.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-034#63:2>
Or perhaps I just may need more powerful hardware. </I>

<h> Compaq's colour Contura goes 486 </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-034#65:3>
By JANET TAN

<ICE-SIN:W2B-034#66:3>
Over the past few years, I have been using laptops and notebooks,
upgrading every 9-12 months.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-034#67:3>
I using the Compaq 3/25 when offered the opportunity to use a Compaq
Contura 4/25CX recently, and it is the most satisfying to date.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-034#68:3>
As it turned out, I found little difference between the Compaq LTE
Lite 4/25C and the new Compaq Contura 4/25 CX, with the exception of the
price, the looks and the former's option of a docking station to house
additional peripherals.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-034#69:3>
With its 486 SL chip and 120MB hard disk, the CX can satisfy the
appetite for today's powerful software requirements of the mobile executive.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-034#70:3>
Adding a new active matrix colour display to it certainly makes
graphical software much easier to use.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-034#71:3>
I particularly like the built-in trackball - a near-mandatory
requirement if you ever use Windows.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-034#72:3>
No more external mouse connected to the serial port - a real
inconvenience if you are on the move.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-034#73:3>
Most other built-in track-ball configurations that I have seen tend
to be situated in the centre or below the keyboard.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-034#74:3>
While these do not discriminate against left or right handers, it is
probably neither convenient to both.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-034#75:3>
The keyboard is sufficiently silent without losing that touch and
feel so necessary to know you have hit a key.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-034#76:3>
The " silent" clicking sound of the keyboard and alarm when you close
the screen makes the machine less of an attention getter especially when you
use it in a meeting.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-034#77:3>
The slimmer keyboard compared with the LTE Lite 4/25C, makes typing
more comfortable and less strenuous.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-034#78:3>
The notebook's batteries are now slimmer, and the Hibernation feature
and improved Nickel Metal ( NiMH) type is supposed to help with power
management.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-034#79:3>
But each battery still lasts only slightly more than two hours,
unfortunately.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-034#80:3>
For me, this means three battery packs to get any decent usage on
those long plane journeys.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-034#81:3>
There are various power management/conservation utilities which I did
not have the time to explore.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-034#82:3>
The Hibernation feature is neat in that you can place a mark to save
your work and power off.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-034#83:3>
Hibernation comes on automatically when the power is low.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-034#84:3>
In addition, there is the new, slimmer AC dual-voltage pack to power
up the system and to recharge the batteries at the same time.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-034#85:3>
Recharging also appears to be faster than previous machines.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-034#86:3>
The black-coloured design is sexier than the LTE Lite 4/25C.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-034#87:3>
The CX carries a three-year worldwide guarantee and pre-installed
MS-DOS and MS Windows.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-034#88:3>
At a suggested retail price of S&dollar;6,152, the Contura does stand very
competitively with other similar offerings. </I>

<h> Unix six take on Windows NT power As the battle is joined between
flexibility and power, who will emerge the winner? </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-034#90:4>
by Grace Chng

<ICE-SIN:W2B-034#91:4>
Computer vendors are gearing up to meet the challenge posed by the
impending launch by Microsoft of its much publicised Windows NT operating
system.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-034#92:4>
The six computer vendors - Hewlett-Packard, IBM, the Santa Cruz
Operation, Sun Microsystems, Univel and Unix System Laboratories - have
agreed to adopt a common set of technologies that will result in software
being truly interchangeable on their machines.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-034#93:4>
Coincidentally, Microsoft held a sneak preview of Windows NT in
Singapore just before the global announcement of the six.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-034#94:4>
Windows NT expects to deliver the power that is needed for
large-scale complex computing functions that used to be carried out on large
computers like mini computers.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-034#95:4>
Therein lies the threat to vendors like the six who have banded
together.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-034#96:4>
They supply organisations with powerful computing systems that can
replace bigger computers known as minicomputers and mainframes.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-034#97:4>
Applications on these big computers run Unix, an operating system
which allows applications, like payroll and database, to be used on any - -
almost any - - type of hardware supplied by them.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-034#98:4>
Windows NT promises to deliver these applications on PCs and
workstations that are based on DOS and some Unix programs.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-034#99:4>
The cooperation of the six vendors mean that their hardware will use
the same technologies based on the Unix environment.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-034#100:4>
To users, they can mix and match the hardware and software of their
choice.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-034#101:4>
Software developers now know which technologies to use to write
their applications programs.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-034#102:4>
Users will benefit from this as the cost of software will fall as
developers need not write separate versions for different hardware platforms.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-034#103:4>
Previously, Unix applications were not truly interchangeable.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-034#104:4>
They had to be fine-tuned to ensure that they can run on different
hardware platforms.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-034#105:4>
Currently, Microsoft, the world's largest software company, has a
stranglehold over the PC software market.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-034#106:4>
With Widows NT, Microsoft seeks to extend its influence to the
high-end computing arena.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-034#107:4>
The six vendors have received the endorsement of many other hardware
and software companies.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-034#108:4>
They include Computer Associates, Convex Computer, Fujitsu, Hitachi,
ICL, Ingres, Oki Eletric Industry, Oracle, Samsung, Siemens-Nixdorf, Stratus
Computer, Unisys and Autodesk.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-034#109:4>
However, Hewlett-Packard, which initiated this move about a year, is
not closing its doors on Windows NT.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-034#110:4>
Said Mr Paul Chan, managing director of HP Sales ( Singapore):Buyers
vote with their money.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-034#111:4>
" If they prefer Windows NT, then we will ensure that our hardware
can run Windows NT". </I>

<h> Digital music Minidisc style </h> Originating from Japan, land
of the coolest electronic gadgets, is the sharp MD-MS701.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-034#113:5>
It's tiny, square, and ultra-cool.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-034#114:5>
Retailing at
&dollar;499, this is the ultimate cool accessory for the musically-inclined.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-034#115:5>
It plays and records, and comes with enough editing options to make
a Sasha/Digweed/Warren/Fontaine wannabe happy ( moving, joining, splitting
and deleting tracks).

<ICE-SIN:W2B-034#116:5>
What's more, the controls are well thought-out and easy to use.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-034#117:5>
The remote control's design is also something all portable MD
players should emulate: it has got a head-phone jack so you can use any
headphones you desire.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-034#118:5>

<h> Motorola StarTac X </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-034#120:6>
Come June, the StarTac will get even smaller with the new and
improved StarTac X.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-034#121:6>
Compared to the current StarTac 90, the " X" model is smaller and
lighter by 15%, uses the small SIM card, has a new " silky texture" finish (
including a gold bat wing logo), and has a longer talk and standby time.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-034#122:6>
The " X" model also retains the vibration mode for registering
incoming calls, while offering enough features for anybody to be happy. <X>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-034#X123:6>
