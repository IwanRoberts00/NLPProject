<h> HOMECOMING </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2F-004#2:1>
There was a tap at the window; a pair of glasses was visible between
the panes.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-004#3:1>
He got up and went to the window.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-004#4:1>
The man who stood outside was about forty, with a smooth clear skin
and a slight paunch - it slopped out like a deflated punching bag over the
low-slung belt around his waist.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-004#5:1>
" What do you want?" he said calmly: there was a hint of an accent in
his voice and the man outside began to look faintly antagonistic.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-004#6:1>
" The owner of the flat died - about a week and a half ago and the HDB
has taken the flat back.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-004#7:1>
Strangers are not supposed to be walking in and out - " " I'm his
son," he said.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-004#8:1>
" I've just returned from England and I'm sorting out my father's
things." The man said, " Really, ah!

<ICE-SIN:W2F-004#9:1>
I didn't know he had a son.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-004#10:1>
In fact, didn't even know he was married.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-004#11:1>
He was so quiet, you know - " " Yes, I know," the son said softly,
and closed the window-panes, but so gently that it hardly seemed like a snub.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-004#12:1>
There was a tentative tap at the window again; he ignored it and the
tap was not repeated.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-004#13:1>
Far below, he could hear someone's radio blaring out the American Top
40, while a piano was being thumped on in the flat above.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-004#14:1>
He could even hear the raised voice of a mother furiously and nasally
scolding her child in Hokkien.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-004#15:1>
He had forgotten about the noise, all those years away, and he
thought for a while about how noise even sounded different in a cold climate
- it seemed to echo more, to have a quality of being suspended in air like
fragile crystalware, giving a sense of breathless anticipation, of not
knowing what to expect as you rounded a corner.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-004#16:1>
Or so he thought.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-004#17:1>
Here, noise seemed to come from the gut of some monster in the earth.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-004#18:1>
He roused himself.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-004#19:1>
His father had slit his wrists and bled to death in his bed and he
wanted to find a reason for it, if he could.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-004#20:1>
The police had said, in a shocked way, Murder?

<ICE-SIN:W2F-004#21:1>
Not this time, and they had stared accusingly at him, as though he
had driven his father to suicide himself, and was now trying to cover up for
it.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-004#22:1>
Loneliness, they said glibly.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-004#23:1>
The man had lived utterly alone for five years - no relatives to
speak of, no wife ( ran off with a foreigner, hadn't she!

<ICE-SIN:W2F-004#24:1>
- bad lot), only son studying in the wilderness of Britain.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-004#25:1>
No friends to speak of either - he was terribly reclusive, the
neighbours said.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-004#26:1>
Withdrawn.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-004#27:1>
Retired, moreover, three years ago.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-004#28:1>
Did nothing but stay in his flat all day, re-reading the papers and
waiting for the day his son would come home.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-004#29:1>
Well, then.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-004#30:1>
Motives, reasons galore.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-004#31:1>
He had wanted to shoot the whole police station to bits.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-004#32:1>
He stood in the middle of the sitting room and stared round - but it
was no use, he could get up no feelings of regret, even recognition, for the
home he'd once lived in.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-004#33:1>
He thought the two-room flat looked terrible, with its mottled,
aquamarine walls, mottled, aquamarine furniture, and the glaring starkness of
those same walls and furniture.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-004#34:1>
He thought he remembered a faded Van Gogh print and three Chinese
scrolls - they were gone.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-004#35:1>
The closet in his father's room contained a week's change of clothes,
all grey, all unironed, the artifacts of a man who did his own washing and
had ceased to care what he wore.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-004#36:1>
Under the bed he'd discovered a pile of magazines about China,
dust-ridden.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-004#37:1>
His father, he knew, had been born in Shanghai, had fled as a boy of
eight on a boat to Hong Kong during the Second World War, then Singapore, all
the while taking care of a younger brother who had eventually died of
cholera.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-004#38:1>
It was a spectacular immigrant's story - the stuff of tear-jerkers
in the Chinese press.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-004#39:1>
As a child, he had always enjoyed his father's narration: He (
prompting): Then what did you do, Dad, when you got to Hong Kong?

<ICE-SIN:W2F-004#40:1>
His father ( sighing): Aaia, I was just eight, but what a resourceful
eight!

<ICE-SIN:W2F-004#41:1>
I sold newspapers, I shone shoes ...

<ICE-SIN:W2F-004#42:1>
I undercharged the street price once by a cent and they pulled a
knife on me - I ran incredible risks for that lousy cent!

<ICE-SIN:W2F-004#43:1>
I held car doors open for the women at the Jockey Club, while dodging
the commissionaire.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-004#44:1>
Do you know, I would have held those car doors open for nothing.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-004#45:1>
I just liked looking at a world I had no part of ...

<ICE-SIN:W2F-004#46:1>
they wore the most marvellous dresses, I thought, particularly the
Chinese women.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-004#47:1>
They felt they had to keep their end up, I suppose ...

<ICE-SIN:W2F-004#48:1>
His father had been a romantic, an unabashed sucker for sentiment and
nostalgia.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-004#49:1>
Even as an adult, he would take his only son with him in the evenings
to a small hill-rise to watch the sun set and quote half-remembered snatches
of poetry.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-004#50:1>
His wife thought he was a right nutter; she said so, too.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-004#51:1>
She made it clear that one had the prerogative to enjoy sunsets only
after one had shown one could provide for the family - which he was rather
inept in doing.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-004#52:1>
It wasn't his father's fault, the boy thought loyally; even then he'd
disliked his mother's no-nonsense realism, her work ethic, her battle-cry of,
The Chinese are not like the others - we Chinese, we work.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-004#53:1>
( Thinking about it now, the man was reminded of the Indians and
Pakistanis he'd met in England who said scornfully of the English that the
only reason for unemployment was because the Anglo whites were afraid of
getting their hands dirty.) Finally, though, his mother had relieved herself
of her two burdens - there one day, gone the next - and she had never come
back.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-004#54:1>
The child had rather hoped she would; after all, she was still his
mother and the only one of them who could cook properly - but she never had.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-004#55:1>
He had given up hoping after a year.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-004#56:1>
Those magazines on China bothered him.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-004#57:1>
Had his father been planning a trip with his CPF savings?

<ICE-SIN:W2F-004#58:1>
He had distant cousins there, no more.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-004#59:1>
Perhaps life in Singapore had become increasingly remote to him, as
he lived alone, and only his childhood, in the so-called motherland, had been
real to him.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-004#60:1>
His father had given no inkling of the kind in his letters.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-004#61:1>
Those dry-as-dust, factual little letters that were each a replica of
the ones before.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-004#62:1>
He had always read them after his day at the university, standing by
the window of the bed-sit he had rented to cut down on living expenses and
which wasn't large enough to swing a cat in.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-004#63:1>
He, too, had lived alone, and within the confines of the Asian
community at the university.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-004#64:1>
Read the letters while the Jamaicans next door played their reggae
and got high on ganja and dreamed of the Rasta man free in his own land.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-004#65:1>
The letters were like whispers through the crack in his mind which
was the only admission he gave of the existence of his country.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-004#66:1>
He had, for a while, gone through a violent phase of apostasy
regarding the political and social systems he'd been brought up in; the other
Singapore students, as a result, had cut him dead.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-004#67:1>
Dear son ( the letters ran, in small, beautifully formed Chinese
script), How are you?

<ICE-SIN:W2F-004#68:1>
I read the London temperature in the papers today - 10 degrees
Celsius.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-004#69:1>
It seems to me extremely cold.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-004#70:1>
You had better keep warm.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-004#71:1>
Thank you for your letter, but I don't want you to feel you are
obliged to write regularly.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-004#72:1>
Your studies are far more important, believe me.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-004#73:1>
A scholarship student like you has far more to live up to than the
ordinary paper chaser.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-004#74:1>
I am well, myself.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-004#75:1>
As you know, I have been following The Father's House on Channel 8;
it is exciting stuff...

<ICE-SIN:W2F-004#76:1>
They told nothing and gave nothing away and their tone remained the
same even when the son was furiously scribbling out his spleen at the
government who had sent him overseas and allowed his father to finally
purchase his flat only in middle age.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-004#77:1>
It was as though his father spoke his whimsy to some cardboard
offspring he had stuck on a wall in his room, ignoring the real one.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-004#78:1>
But that was his father, of course; he had realised that, when the
exasperation had died down.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-004#79:1>
His father's life's work had been to escape reality, all along.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-004#80:1>
He could not find any of his letters to his father, except for the
last one, which had been found by his bedside.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-004#81:1>
He was piqued at not finding any, and even hurt, for a moment - but
his father had kept remarkably few things.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-004#82:1>
No superfluous pieces of paper - no lists, no bills, no diaries, no
books - only his most important documents, tied up with a rubberband.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-004#83:1>
As though to be able to account for his existence if ever any
mythical Secret Police broke in.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-004#84:1>
No photographs, the son realised.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-004#85:1>
No badly taken shots of him as a child, smirking horribly in various
places of interest, no wedding snaps with everybody standing around trying to
look as if they were enjoying themselves.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-004#86:1>
No record of a life anywhere.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-004#87:1>
He thought his father must have been trying to whittle himself out of
memory and mind.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-004#88:1>
Paring himself down to nothing.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-004#89:1>
He knew, now, why the police were so certain his father had committed
suicide, despite the absence of a suicide note.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-004#90:1>
How could you cry for a man who wanted so desperately to be
forgotten!

<ICE-SIN:W2F-004#91:1>
He had never known his father.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-004#92:1>
That sounded trite - after all, very few people did; their fathers
were figures in the background, sources of funds, reproaches and unwanted
advice.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-004#93:1>
But his father hadn't even been that.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-004#94:1>
He had always been shadowy and towards the end of his life he had
stepped into the dark altogether and there was no spotlight strong enough to
reclaim him.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-004#95:1>
For a moment, he was angry.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-004#96:1>
He had liked those photographs, dammit, they were a part of the life
he had left.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-004#97:1>
He hated coming back to find a robbed and empty mausoleum.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-004#98:1>
His father had had no right -

<ICE-SIN:W2F-004#99:1>
Going into his old room, he flung himself on his bed, staring at the
ceiling.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-004#100:1>
His father had left his things alone at least - the book prizes he'd
won at school and never read, his track medals, other schoolboy bits and
pieces.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-004#101:1>
They revolted him now; everything in the flat revolted him and when
he thought of the packet of sugar and tin of beans he'd found in the kitchen,
nothing else, he wanted to throw up.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-004#102:1>
War rations!

<ICE-SIN:W2F-004#103:1>
What did his father do with the sugar?

<ICE-SIN:W2F-004#104:1>
Lick it!

<ICE-SIN:W2F-004#105:1>
Feed it to ants!

<ICE-SIN:W2F-004#106:1>
Crunch it with his toes!

<ICE-SIN:W2F-004#107:1>
And again the senselessness of his father's life and suicide struck
him.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-004#108:1>
Okay, so his father hadn't wanted to live, had nothing to live for.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-004#109:1>
A son whom he hadn't seen for five years - the scholarship money
didn't cover vacations - was nothing to live for and so he had left this life
as quietly as he had lived it.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-004#110:1>
He wanted to shout, Murderer, and, What have you left me to live for
now?

<ICE-SIN:W2F-004#111:1>
He had wanted to come back, triumphant, with a First, and take care
of his father in his old age, the old tale beloved of Chinese moralists, the
tale of filial piety.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-004#112:1>
Well, Dad, you had to take that away with you as well, didn't you,
when you took everything else.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-004#113:1>
Then he began to blame himself.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-004#114:1>
He should have sensed that his father was slowly going under: anyone
would, with nothing but four mottled aquamarine walls to talk to.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-004#115:1>
He should have known.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-004#116:1>
He should have brought his father out.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-004#117:1>
He should have - slit his father's wrists for him. <X>

<ICE-SIN:W2F-004#X118:1>
He lay for nearly an hour, fuming, battling his anger.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-004#X119:1>
Above him the piano-player crashed out the opening chords of
Beethoven's Fifth Symphony, every chord with a note wrong. </X> </I>
