Okay good morning class

<ICE-SIN:S1B-012#2:1:A>
Now we have a guest today

<ICE-SIN:S1B-012#3:1:A>
Brenda Lee is it

<ICE-SIN:S1B-012#4:1:A>
Your last name

<ICE-SIN:S1B-012#5:1:A>
Lee

<ICE-SIN:S1B-012#6:1:A>
She's here to tape uhm the lecture for uh research

<ICE-SIN:S1B-012#7:1:A>
Uhm today is the last lecture for for the history of music course

<ICE-SIN:S1B-012#8:1:A>
Ah and we'll be covering very briefly uhm compo composers and
compositions from the nineteen fifty onwards

<ICE-SIN:S1B-012#9:1:A>
None of these compositions that I'll be mentioning are on the wide
listening list

<ICE-SIN:S1B-012#10:1:A>
These are additional works which you might have to identify to in
the unknown so okay please listen to the features of these composition when
you ah are listening now uh

<ICE-SIN:S1B-012#11:1:A>
Okay by the nineteen fifty now a majority of performers and
composers had already familiarised themselves with uhm the twelve tones
serial technique of Schoenberg <unclear> word </unclear> and Webern as we
were discussing two weeks ago

<ICE-SIN:S1B-012#12:1:A>
Uh not all of them accepted the serialisation techniques of these
composers but for those who did such as Babbit B-a-b-b-i-t and Messiaen

<ICE-SIN:S1B-012#13:1:A>
Those that adopted the twelve tones techniques went further and
serialised almost all aspects of music composition

<ICE-SIN:S1B-012#14:1:A>
Uh aspects such as anyone

<ICE-SIN:S1B-012#15:1:A>
What else do you think could be serialised

<ICE-SIN:S1B-012#16:1:A>
Other than notes

<ICE-SIN:S1B-012#17:1:A>
I mentioned this before

<ICE-SIN:S1B-012#18:1:A>
How come you're suddenly silent today

<ICE-SIN:S1B-012#19:1:A>
What else

<ICE-SIN:S1B-012#20:1:A>
What else could be serialised

<ICE-SIN:S1B-012#21:1:A>
Okay dynamics of course uhm dynamics one aspect

<ICE-SIN:S1B-012#22:1:A>
One other aspect

<ICE-SIN:S1B-012#23:1:A>
Rhythm

<ICE-SIN:S1B-012#24:1:A>
Another aspect metre metre as two-four three-four tempo and most
importantly colour

<ICE-SIN:S1B-012#25:1:A>
Colour as you know from uh Webern's Class Father Melody

<ICE-SIN:S1B-012#26:1:A>
Alright it opened all tempo possibilities for serialisation

<ICE-SIN:S1B-012#27:1:A>
Okay Class Father Melody is very important so you'll have to
remember

<ICE-SIN:S1B-012#28:1:A>
Now these composers favoured more control with con more control
over their compositions

<ICE-SIN:S1B-012#29:1:A>
So they wanted every aspect of their composition serialised and on
the other hand there was another group that favoured less control over their
composition

<ICE-SIN:S1B-012#30:1:A>
Now these composers included Cage Cage Boulet B-o-u-l-e-t
Stockhausen S-t-o-c-k-h-a-u-s-e-n

<ICE-SIN:S1B-012#31:1:A>
Of course Stockhausen and Boulet also wrote serial ah serial music
okay

<ICE-SIN:S1B-012#32:1:A>
Now there were two opposing camps and one favoured music as thought
thought processing huh control and the other as sound

<ICE-SIN:S1B-012#33:1:A>
Two camps

<ICE-SIN:S1B-012#34:1:A>
One is thought and one is sound freedom

<ICE-SIN:S1B-012#35:1:A>
Also during the nineteen fif fifties you have another new trend
involving the use of electronically produced and manipulated sounds Its term
called Musique Concrete M-u-s-i-q-u-e C-o-n-c-r-e-t-e where musical tones or
national sounds are transformed in various ways by electronic means musical
tones or national sounds are transformed in various ways by electronic means
and assembled on a tape to be played back for performance and assembled on a
tape to be played back in a performance okay

<ICE-SIN:S1B-012#36:1:A>
So these compositions are not live compositions they are
pre-recorded compositions

<ICE-SIN:S1B-012#37:1:A>
These composers Stockhausen was very uh important uh component of
this S-t-o-c-k can be purely electronic sounds

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-012#38:1:B>
I was looking for Studio one

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-012#39:1:A>
Ya because Mr Ho's not around

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-012#40:1:B>
Alright

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-012#41:1:A>
No <unclear> word </unclear>

<ICE-SIN:S1B-012#42:1:A>
Just continue okay

<ICE-SIN:S1B-012#43:1:A>
We'll tell you later

<ICE-SIN:S1B-012#44:1:A>
Okay there are composers such as Stockhausen who experimented very
much with Musique Conrete uh and some of them also use uhm purely electronic
sounds they use uhm synthesizers to make these kind of sounds as opposed to
Stockhausen who use voice as as well as in <unclear> word </unclear>

<ICE-SIN:S1B-012#45:1:A>
Hi John

<ICE-SIN:S1B-012#46:1:A>
You're late

<ICE-SIN:S1B-012#47:1:A>
And because of the stringent requirements of this kind of music
regarding dynamics uh rhythms of <unclear> word </unclear> minute <unclear>
word </unclear> speech and intensity of course the electronic studio is ideal
for this kind of recording

<ICE-SIN:S1B-012#48:1:A>
And John here discussing uh modern music with for this lecture

<ICE-SIN:S1B-012#49:1:A>
Also during this time we had composers who experimented with
different combinations of instruments with different timbre combinations
ranges and those who expect exploited new sounds that came from old
instruments

<ICE-SIN:S1B-012#50:1:A>
This is a score of one composer George Crump

<ICE-SIN:S1B-012#51:1:A>
You can see very unorthodox way of scoring 'cos it's centric huh
you can see and you see the arrows they point uh where the beginning and the
ending of the piece occur and it's scored rather freely

<ICE-SIN:S1B-012#52:1:A>
Uhm you see all these little stars little little asterisks uh
<unclear> word </unclear> which we learn the last time two weeks ago huh and
he makes the uhm electric guitar play with plastic rods a very unusual
instrument and combination of that

<ICE-SIN:S1B-012#53:1:A>
Okay this is the score of George Crump one such composer

<ICE-SIN:S1B-012#54:1:A>
Also we had tone clusters very new sounds and they are scored this
way on this way or like that sometimes okay

<ICE-SIN:S1B-012#55:1:A>
And it can be anything from this to this

<ICE-SIN:S1B-012#56:1:A>
Anything but the of course the composer would uhm indicate which is
the top note and which is the bottom note huh

<ICE-SIN:S1B-012#57:1:A>
So this would be written down the the range will be written down

<ICE-SIN:S1B-012#58:1:A>
Okay composers who wrote for piano

<ICE-SIN:S1B-012#59:1:A>
One Henry Cowell American composer who wrote uh music as early as
the twenties who wrote this kind of music as early the twenty they
incorporated tone clusters

<ICE-SIN:S1B-012#60:1:A>
Another innovation came from John Cage C-a-g-e we spoke of them
earlier who wrote very much for the prepared piano prepared piano in the
nineteen forty where he had bolts screws spoons forks uh rubber eraser uh
inserted in the strings to create a kind of percussion ensemble

<ICE-SIN:S1B-012#61:1:A>
Now of course you'll give instructions as to uh the pianist will
reach for the inner key and play this this string or that string in a
particular manner or fashion or to strike a string inside the keyboard rather
than on the white key

<ICE-SIN:S1B-012#62:1:A>
These are new innovational techniques

<ICE-SIN:S1B-012#63:1:A>
Also uh popular were the new harmonics that were explored at this
time

<ICE-SIN:S1B-012#64:1:A>
Techniques new harmonic and new techniques such as the increased
use of flutter tongue technique in wind instrument

<ICE-SIN:S1B-012#65:1:A>
<unclear> word </unclear> you had chromatic clusters and all the
voice the spoken word as well uhm as you can see the voice has to speak
certain things indicated huh very syllabic words of vowels sometimes or
whispered sounds or halfway between voice and speech question mark

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-012#66:1:C>
Uhm uhm

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-012#67:1:A>
Uhm

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-012#68:1:C>
Can you repeat the part on increased use of tongue

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-012#69:1:A>
From John Cage

<ICE-SIN:S1B-012#70:1:A>
Oh in the new there's a new use of harmonics and techniques
techniques will include the use of flutter tongue know what I mean

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-012#71:1:C>
What is flutter tongue

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-012#72:1:A>
where the tongue face and against the palate and and rolls
them into the instrument

<ICE-SIN:S1B-012#73:1:A>
Ya

<ICE-SIN:S1B-012#74:1:A>
Will you demonstrate that again

<ICE-SIN:S1B-012#75:1:A>
Uhm of course you have to blow an instrument at the same time huh
and do that

<ICE-SIN:S1B-012#76:1:A>
Okay Glissandos glissandos the chromatic clusters and for the voice
we had spoken and whispered sounds as well as <unclear> word </unclear> which
is in between singing and speech

<ICE-SIN:S1B-012#77:1:A>
Occasionally the instrumentalists were uh requested to say these
sounds too to participate vocally rather than just playing

<ICE-SIN:S1B-012#78:1:A>
The percussion ensemble well increased in size as well and there
was a a greater need for more exotic instruments that were being used

<ICE-SIN:S1B-012#79:1:A>
Instruments such as the gamalan uhm the gongs more Asian
instruments that were used this time

<ICE-SIN:S1B-012#80:1:A>
For the sirens when <unclear> word </unclear> siren a fire
instrument to be used in the ensemble could actually it's a pity we took the
uhm projector from here lah

<ICE-SIN:S1B-012#81:1:A>
Uhm I made this transparency to show you the trends that took place
in the nineteen after nineteen hundred okay

<ICE-SIN:S1B-012#82:1:A>
You can see we have experimental tradition right at the top
nineteen twenties and we have mainstream okay

<ICE-SIN:S1B-012#83:1:A>
Mainstream we have people like Ravel in the mid composing alongside
and then under experimental tradition we have composers such as Ives
Shoenberg Webern <unclear> word </unclear> huh

<ICE-SIN:S1B-012#84:1:A>
They were experimenting the twelve tone technique and various
instrumental techniques

<ICE-SIN:S1B-012#85:1:A>
Okay

<ICE-SIN:S1B-012#86:1:A>
Then we had twelve tone techniques quarter tone techniques

<ICE-SIN:S1B-012#87:1:A>
Okay uhm thirties with sound mass noise uhm composers such as
<unclear> word </unclear> all compose so you see how they uhm the score is
done is down

<ICE-SIN:S1B-012#88:1:A>
It's grey and black lines and sheets of lines and if you wanna
crescendo you see uh expansion of this kind of graphics thicker darker lines
okay

<ICE-SIN:S1B-012#89:1:A>
And there's no note uh written down just masses of colour or sound
and after the thirties it branched off into less control and more control

<ICE-SIN:S1B-012#90:1:A>
So under less control we have indeterminacy which is a an important
term you'll remember and more control ultra serialisation such as Babbit uhm
Babbit Messiaen who serialised all as other aspects of their music such as
colour dynamics ahah

<ICE-SIN:S1B-012#91:1:A>
So on this side we have then we went further to go into
computerisation where they use computers to write music uhm

<ICE-SIN:S1B-012#92:1:A>
On the right hand side you can see we have use of new instruments
after nineteen forties <unclear> word </unclear> is one of them just mention
him

<ICE-SIN:S1B-012#93:1:A>
Uhm improvisation techniques like composers uh gave performers a
free hand and doing what they want I'll go on further with this and parallel
to this we see chance music which uh John Cage is a very important proponent
of this kind of music uhm

<ICE-SIN:S1B-012#94:1:A>
And further down the line before sixties we see new instrumental
technique improvisational groups further on and live electronic music that
comes straight down from the experimental tradition and theatre music
happenings and anti-art

<ICE-SIN:S1B-012#95:1:A>
Maybe I'll I'll make a copy of this for you all since you're can't
read this okay

<ICE-SIN:S1B-012#96:1:A>
So you see the tradition of the composers streaming ah taking
opting for one route or the other but of course during the fifties uh it's a
very experimental time and most composers dabbled at one or the other like
Stockhausen's works uh Messiaen Babbit too and some of them would also write
for non serial or chance music okay

<ICE-SIN:S1B-012#97:1:A>
Then we go on to Berio which I'll speak on briefly because uh I
brought the CD along the songs for Cathy which Berio wrote for his wife Cathy
Berberian B-e-r-b-e-r-i-a-n and I'll play the sequenza for you Sequenza Three
for voice for his wife which he wrote in fifty six

<ICE-SIN:S1B-012#98:1:A>
Okay Luciano Berio B-e-r-i-o was born in nineteen twenty five in
<unclear> word </unclear> nineteen twenty five <unclear> word </unclear>

<ICE-SIN:S1B-012#99:1:A>
He's a composer conductor and teacher and explored much theater
music

<ICE-SIN:S1B-012#100:1:A>
He married uh the American singer Cathy Berberian in nineteen
fifty whom he also wrote extensively for voice

<ICE-SIN:S1B-012#101:1:A>
He wrote nine sequenzas in all for various solo instruments piano
the harp the trombone the voice and you see in his compositions the sequenzas
uh a tendency to uhm have very theatrical features in it

<ICE-SIN:S1B-012#102:1:A>
For instance the sequenza five were trombone

<ICE-SIN:S1B-012#103:1:A>
I'll read you the instruction

<ICE-SIN:S1B-012#104:1:A>
Okay for the trombonist who's supposed to perform this work

<ICE-SIN:S1B-012#105:1:A>
Okay if you look at the score huh instructions are right at the
top and this is the composition itself for the trombonist

<ICE-SIN:S1B-012#106:1:A>
A very different way of scoring

<ICE-SIN:S1B-012#107:1:A>
Okay he says this is the instruction uh

<ICE-SIN:S1B-012#108:1:A>
On the stage a very low stand and a chair okay so on the stage
you're supposed to have a very low stand and a chair stand as in instrumental
stand

<ICE-SIN:S1B-012#109:1:A>
Walking on the stage during the performance of section a the
performer should wear a white tie

<ICE-SIN:S1B-012#110:1:A>
Could be a <unclear> word </unclear> or could be a <unclear> word
</unclear>

<ICE-SIN:S1B-012#111:1:A>
Strikes the poses of a variety of showmen about to sing an old
favourite right

<ICE-SIN:S1B-012#112:1:A>
Uh inspired he extends his arm raises his and lowers his
instrument slowly or quickly uhm with movements which should appear
spontaneous

<ICE-SIN:S1B-012#113:1:A>
He hesitates

<ICE-SIN:S1B-012#114:1:A>
Just before section b he utters a bewildered why and sits down
without pausing

<ICE-SIN:S1B-012#115:1:A>
He must perform section b as though rehearsing in an empty hall

<ICE-SIN:S1B-012#116:1:A>
Okay these are the instructions very theatrical and you can see
it's very staged and locations are given here for those who didn't have this

<ICE-SIN:S1B-012#117:1:A>
Now I'll play for you Sequenza Three which I unfortunately I don't
have a score to

<ICE-SIN:S1B-012#118:1:A>
This <unclear> word </unclear> is written for his wife Cathy
Berberian

<ICE-SIN:S1B-012#119:1:A>
Sequenza Three written in nineteen sixty six and it's divided into
ten second bars

<ICE-SIN:S1B-012#120:1:A>
Okay the bars are timed in ten seconds

<ICE-SIN:S1B-012#121:1:A>
So rather than the conventional bars ten second bars and involves
detailed and specific features

<ICE-SIN:S1B-012#122:1:A>
Sound tones speech whispers

<ICE-SIN:S1B-012#123:1:A>
There are forty four different emotional indications in all and
the text is by Markus Kutter <X>

<ICE-SIN:S1B-012#X124:1:A>
This is the text and it reads 'Give me a few words for a woman to
sing a truth allowing us to build a house without worrying before night
comes' This is the text and this is going to run for seven over minutes </X>
</I>
