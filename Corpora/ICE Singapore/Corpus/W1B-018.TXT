Dear Chia Keng Seng,

<ICE-SIN:W1B-018#12:1>
At Citibank, we understand what a person goes through when applying
for a personal loan.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-018#13:1>
You attend interviews at the banks, fill up lengthy forms, get asked
to submit extensive income documents, and tell a complete stranger why you
need a loan.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-018#14:1>
Next, you wait around for a week or two, and finally you get a letter
saying " approved" or " declined".

<ICE-SIN:W1B-018#15:1>
Definitely a tedious process.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-018#16:1>
At Citibank, we've simplified the process.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-018#17:1>
It's faster.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-018#18:1>
And much more straightforward.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-018#19:1>
You don't need to pledge any collateral.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-018#20:1>
You don't need to attend any lengthy interviews.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-018#21:1>
In fact, there's no need to visit the bank.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-018#22:1>
All you need to do is complete the enclosed Application Form and mail
it to us, along with your latest IR8A form or your latest computerized
pay-slip or a letter from your employer.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-018#23:1>
Within 5 days, we'll send you a check for the net value of your
personal loan ( see Monthly Repayment Table in brochure) when your
application is approved.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-018#24:1>
So, you can now expand your business with the capital you need.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-018#25:1>
Or realize that long overdue dream to do up your home.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-018#26:1>
Or join a country club.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-018#27:1>
In other words, you are free to use the money in any way you see fit.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-018#28:1>
There will be no questions asked.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-018#29:1>
And Citibank Personal Loan is also easy to manage.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-018#30:1>
Here's how it works: The interest rate is fixed.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-018#31:1>
So is the monthly repayment.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-018#32:1>
That means, you don't have to worry about interest rate fluctuations
which can increase your monthly repayment.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-018#33:1>
Each month, you'll receive a statement of account that tells you the
total balance outstanding, the repayment amount, and the due date for
payment, which is 20 days after the statement date.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-018#34:1>
For repayment, simply mail us a check using the pre-paid envelope
you'll receive with your monthly statement.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-018#35:1>
Just take a look at the Monthly Repayment Table in the enclosed
brochure, and choose the amount ( net value of the loan) and the term (
repayment period) that suits you best.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-018#36:1>
At Citibank, we make each process as easy as possible.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-018#37:1>
So, why not put an end to wasting time visiting other banks, and
waiting around for an answer?

<ICE-SIN:W1B-018#38:1>
If you would like a Citibank Personal Loan right now, just complete
the Application Form and send it to us today.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-018#39:1>

<ICE-SIN:W1B-018#51:2>
June 1993

<ICE-SIN:W1B-018#52:2>
Dear Cheng Ling Kiaw,

<ICE-SIN:W1B-018#53:2>
Some time ago, I wrote to invite you to apply for Citibank Ready
Credit.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-018#54:2>
Since I haven't heard from you, I thought I'd write to you again.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-018#55:2>
Perhaps the last time I wrote, you didn't see a need to spend
&dollar;60 on the Citibank Ready Credit annual fee.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-018#56:2>
And, even now, you still feel the same way.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-018#57:2>
That's fine, if you only think of the fee as a way to start an
account with us.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-018#58:2>
But, when you consider what you're really buying - the power and
convenience of a large, personal cash reserve - then I'm sure you'll agree
that's worth a great deal more than just
&dollar;60! 

<ICE-SIN:W1B-018#59:2>
Besides, have you thought of those unexpected times when you
suddenly need extra cash?

<ICE-SIN:W1B-018#60:2>
With Citibank Ready Credit, you're ready for any kind of situation.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-018#61:2>
For when new business opportunities crop up, or when you need a quick
break from the pressure of work, in some exciting city or romantic resort.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-018#62:2>
With Citibank Ready Credit by your side, you'll always have the
security of a solid backup of cash, and the freedom to respond quickly to any
opportunity or emergency that may come your way.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-018#63:2>
Any time, any place.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-018#64:2>
Plus, you decide how much you want to use.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-018#65:2>
And, how long you'd like to use it for.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-018#66:2>
You can draw on your credit line for as short as a day, a week, a
month or longer.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-018#67:2>
It's your choice.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-018#68:2>
Repayment is easy too.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-018#69:2>
Again, it's up to you.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-018#70:2>
Whether you want to pay in part or in full.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-018#71:2>
The best part is, if you don't use Citibank Ready Credit, you don't
have to pay interest on it.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-018#72:2>
But, when you do need ready cash, you'll always be prepared.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-018#73:2>
Because Citibank Ready Credit puts a Citibank checkbook in your
hands.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-018#74:2>
Just write a check, for any amount.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-018#75:2>
Even up to your full credit line.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-018#76:2>
Or use the Citicard ( ATM card) to withdraw up to
&dollar;2,000 cash a day.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-018#77:2>
From any of our conveniently located ATMs.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-018#78:2>
In addition, there is a whole host of value-added extras that come
with Citibank Ready Credit.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-018#79:2>
With our 24-hour CitiPhone Banking, you can always depend on us.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-018#80:2>
Just one phone call, that's all you need.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-018#81:2>
Whether it's to update your account or to request a temporary
extension on your credit line in a medical emergency.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-018#82:2>
We're here to help.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-018#83:2>
There is also the 24-hour Worldwide Personal Accident Protection of
up to
&dollar;150 000, which no other bank in Singapore offers.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-018#84:2>
And Credit Life Benefit which cancels the outstanding balance on your
account should the unforeseen happen.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-018#85:2>
My invitation to you to apply for Citibank Ready Credit is still
open.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-018#86:2>
I urge you to apply for ready cash today.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-018#87:2>
Just complete the enclosed Application Form and mail it back before
20 August 1993.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-018#88:2>
There's no need for collateral or a guarantor.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-018#89:2>
You don't need to come in for an interview.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-018#90:2>
Because you don't know when you'll need extra cash, it pays to be
prepared.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-018#91:2>
To give yourself as many options as possible.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-018#92:2>
Especially for those times when you will need cash, fast.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-018#93:2>
And for that, you can always depend on Citibank Ready Credit and the
world-famous Citibank service.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-018#94:2>
Don't miss out this time.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-018#95:2>
Accept my invitation today.

Dear Chia Shyh Chiuan,

<ICE-SIN:W1B-018#111:3>
The most preferred cards in the world are yours to accept, today.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-018#112:3>
A " preferred prospective customer".

<ICE-SIN:W1B-018#113:3>
That's what we, at Citibank, call someone like you.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-018#114:3>
Which means I can be sure you're an individual who appreciates
preferred service.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-018#115:3>
And I'm delighted to inform you that you've been pre-approved for
the Citibank Preferred Gold VISA or MasterCard.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-018#116:3>
Accept our invitation now, and you'll be able to take advantage of
the biggest travel program to ever get off the ground - Citibank Miles Ahead.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-018#117:3>
All you have to do is fill in the form and mail it today.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-018#118:3>
But, before you do so, let me tell you more about the only two cards
that go much further than function and practicality.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-018#119:3>
When you carry a Citibank Preferred Gold VISA or MasterCard, you're
carrying a card that's backed by impeccable service.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-018#120:3>
Service that no other card company can match.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-018#121:3>
In fact, I can say, Citibank Preferred Gold Cards are the world's
most recognised, most accepted choice amongst credit cards.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-018#122:3>
The most preferred.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-018#123:3>
We have more than 27 million Cardmembers around the world.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-018#124:3>
And they know that, at Citibank, they come first.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-018#125:3>
Always.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-018#126:3>
Our Cardmembers can also expect us to keep coming up with more new
and exciting programs for them.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-018#127:3>
The latest and biggest of these is the Citibank Miles Ahead travel
program.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-018#128:3>
It lets you earn travel points for guaranteed holidays in many
destinations, at incredibly low prices.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-018#129:3>
And, it's the only such program of its kind in Singapore today!

<ICE-SIN:W1B-018#130:3>
Here's how it works.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-018#131:3>
Every
&dollar;100 you charge to your card earns you one travel point.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-018#132:3>
When you have collected 30 points, you can use them to buy Qantas
Airways tickets at incredible prices.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-018#133:3>
From 65% to 85% off their normal rates.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-018#134:3>
We pick up the difference.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-018#135:3>
So, for Citibank Preferred Gold Cardmembers, Tahiti is only
&dollar;849. 

<ICE-SIN:W1B-018#136:3>
Cairns,
&dollar;499. 

<ICE-SIN:W1B-018#137:3>
And Honolulu, a mere
&dollar;999. 

<ICE-SIN:W1B-018#138:3>
Return.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-018#139:3>
No ifs, no maybes.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-018#140:3>
But guarantees.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-018#141:3>
You can also save up to 40% at the Hilton International group of
hotels in the city you visit.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-018#142:3>
And, there are 21 Qantas destinations to choose from.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-018#143:3>
So, you can go ahead and plan a holiday almost anywhere between
Kuala Lumpur and London, or Jakarta and Honolulu.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-018#144:3>
There's no limit to the number of Qantas tickets you can buy with
your Citibank Miles Ahead travel points.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-018#145:3>
The more points you earn, the bigger and better your holiday can be.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-018#146:3>
We've also included a two-day stay for two in a luxurious suite at
The Beaufort Singapore for only
&dollar;169, which is 70% off the regular rate.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-018#147:3>
Just to give you a chance to have a relaxing weekend away from it
all, without having to actually get away.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-018#148:3>
The Citibank Miles Ahead travel program has just begun.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-018#149:3>
So, there's plenty of time for you to take full advantage of it.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-018#150:3>
And to get you off to a good start, you will receive 10 bonus travel
points ( worth
&dollar;1,000 in card charges), with our compliments, as soon as you become a
Citibank Preferred Gold Cardmember.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-018#151:3>
Remember, you have pre-approved status.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-018#152:3>
And you can become a Citibank Cardmember in just seven days.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-018#153:3>
So, you can start accumulating your points for a guaranteed holiday
right away.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-018#154:3>
Your pre-approved status is, however, valid only until May 5, 1993.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-018#155:3>
So accept our invitation right away.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-018#156:3>
I'll be delighted to welcome you to the world of the Citibank

Dear Achiever,

<ICE-SIN:W1B-018#172:4>
April 1992

<ICE-SIN:W1B-018#173:4>
I remember when I held my first credit card, I felt the thrill of
belonging to a privileged group.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-018#174:4>
I'm sure you felt the same.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-018#175:4>
And like me, you probably looked forward to all the benefits it
offered.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-018#176:4>
As a Cardmember, you need a card you can rely on.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-018#177:4>
A card that gives you what you deserve, and more.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-018#178:4>
That's why I'm positive when you apply for your next credit card,
you'll want it from a bank renowned for service excellence for the past 90
years.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-018#179:4>
Undoubtedly, that bank is Citibank.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-018#180:4>
And the cards are Citibank VISA and MasterCard.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-018#181:4>
Citibank is the undisputed leader in the credit card industry.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-018#182:4>
