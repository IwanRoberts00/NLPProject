Hello Mr Lim

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-077#2:1:B>
Hi uh Mr Tan

<ICE-SIN:S1B-077#3:1:B>
How are you

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-077#4:1:A>
Fine thank you

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-077#5:1:B>
Wah been quite a while that I have last since the last time I
come up to your visit

<ICE-SIN:S1B-077#6:1:B>
Looks like you are doing pretty well

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-077#7:1:A>
Oh not not not too well actually

<ICE-SIN:S1B-077#8:1:A>
My business has been pretty bad

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-077#9:1:B>
Oh is it

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-077#10:1:A>
Because of the economic down turn and uh some cash flow
problem also

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-077#11:1:B>
Oh is it but uh I uh I thought the when I uh I was driving in
just now, I saw that you have actually extended your back end of your factory
into a double storey and then I saw I think you have put in a few line lines
of machine

<ICE-SIN:S1B-077#12:1:B>
I thought you were doing pretty well

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-077#13:1:A>
Uhm I it was more for the long term but uh right now is
running into difficulties because of all these extension

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-077#14:1:B>
Oh I see

<ICE-SIN:S1B-077#15:1:B>
In that case you maybe you have expanded uh uh over expanded lah
over the last last last two three years

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-077#16:1:A>
Maybe a bit too fast lah

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-077#17:1:B>
I see I see

<ICE-SIN:S1B-077#18:1:B>
Well anyway this is not the you are not the only customer

<ICE-SIN:S1B-077#19:1:B>
In fact I was just visiting two other customers yesterday at the
somewhere around here Jurong and uh ya everybody looks like they have some
problem here and there

<ICE-SIN:S1B-077#20:1:B>
Especially with this economic crisis

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-077#21:1:A>
Right

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-077#22:1:B>
Ya what what do you see of Indonesia

<ICE-SIN:S1B-077#23:1:B>
Do you think Indonesia would be a would be of any help if they of
any help to business or not if they really win over the elections and a more
stable government is uh in place

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-077#24:1:A>
Uh I think it is going to take time lah with all the violence
going around there

<ICE-SIN:S1B-077#25:1:A>
I I think is going even when a stable government is uh elected I
think it's still going to take years lah

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-077#26:1:B>
Well very sad man

<ICE-SIN:S1B-077#27:1:B>
I mean as banker we uh we always hear this kind of comments make us
jittery man Anyway thanks for your uh uh allowing us to come by to visit you
today

<ICE-SIN:S1B-077#28:1:B>
Actually uh uh we just want to come up to update with you uh as in
our all annual exercises lah

<ICE-SIN:S1B-077#29:1:B>
To to update with you how is business and then we will also want to
discuss a little regarding your credit facilities

<ICE-SIN:S1B-077#30:1:B>
I think you have known uh if you have read the papers uh over the
past few months uh in fact the local banks uh we are actually quite heavy
laden with the with non-performing loans

<ICE-SIN:S1B-077#31:1:B>
So Sad to say but uh because of all these we are actually uh forced
in certain ways to re-look into all the credit facilities granted to our
customers so I think that is basically my objection my my objective today

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-077#32:1:A>
Right uhm uhm all right Mr Lim

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-077#33:1:B>
Ya so actually I was uh in fact my colleague Samuel the other
day have spoken to your secretary uh we are actually looking into to discuss
with you the possibility of reducing your current uh O D line with us

<ICE-SIN:S1B-077#34:1:B>
Currently you have one million so we are actually looking at
reducing the line to eight hundred thousand

<ICE-SIN:S1B-077#35:1:B>
I know it is a bit difficult but uh

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-077#36:1:A>
Wa still have to reduce some more

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-077#37:1:B>
Ya have to reduce

<ICE-SIN:S1B-077#38:1:B>
Ah so I know it is a bit difficult given the uh I mean just now
like what you say about times are bad and all that but we really really have
to come up you know today to tell you basically these are some of the
intention that the bank is adopting

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-077#39:1:A>
But but my business is already so bad and I really have some
strict cash flow problem and all my facilities in this factory is being
stretched to the maximum already and how can you come to me and tell me that
you need to reduce my O D line some more

<ICE-SIN:S1B-077#40:1:A>
I just don't know lah

<ICE-SIN:S1B-077#41:1:A>
I really don't know

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-077#42:1:B>
Uh but actually what we can do is that we we uh we understand
your problem but we really hope that Mr Tan you could understand the position
we are in lah

<ICE-SIN:S1B-077#43:1:B>
Although a lot of time people say that you know banks are you know
during rainy days uh we will take away the umbrella

<ICE-SIN:S1B-077#44:1:B>
But I hope you all can understand that uh we are also quite badly
hit ah

<ICE-SIN:S1B-077#45:1:B>
Property value have all drop and all that

<ICE-SIN:S1B-077#46:1:B>
In fact all the all the case in fact ninety percent of our cases uh
in our portfolio actually to use the term very crudely we are actually all
underwater

<ICE-SIN:S1B-077#47:1:B>
We are all struggling so we we understand we also understand your O
D has been used up to the hilt and then at certain times also you actually
went over the limit but uh we are trying to see whether we can do a
restructure

<ICE-SIN:S1B-077#48:1:B>
We are not trying to say we want to bring it back down to two
hundred lah you know within twenty-four hours

<ICE-SIN:S1B-077#49:1:B>
We are looking at a maybe a restructured payment say maybe five
thousand per month something like that

<ICE-SIN:S1B-077#50:1:B>
Something that you are comfortable with hor and then at least uh
you know we could use this as a tool and then to tie tide over this period of
time

<ICE-SIN:S1B-077#51:1:B>
For all you know five thousand you know a month over over one year
we are looking at only sixty thousand

<ICE-SIN:S1B-077#52:1:B>
So we try to use it as a tool to buy time on your end as well as on
the bank's end

<ICE-SIN:S1B-077#53:1:B>
Then hopefully that when the market recovers and then you know we
could reinstate back the line

<ICE-SIN:S1B-077#54:1:B>
In fact we have been doing this for some of our customers

<ICE-SIN:S1B-077#55:1:B>
So you can be rest assured you know we are not a wet weather bank
but uh we are here to do something that is beneficial on both ends huh

<ICE-SIN:S1B-077#56:1:B>
I hope I hope this is a simple proposition that I can lay it before
you

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-077#57:1:A>
Uhm sounds all right to me but but maybe I didn't say very
strongly that I really have serious cash flow problem and then I really
expanded a bit too fast, so that is being cutting into my uh cash and
businesses and facilities too

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-077#58:1:B>
I see

<ICE-SIN:S1B-077#59:1:B>
Maybe it is because of your investment in China

<ICE-SIN:S1B-077#60:1:B>
I understand last year we actually granted you the additional O D
and it was actually meant for some overseas investment in China

<ICE-SIN:S1B-077#61:1:B>
I understand it was something like Shanghai

<ICE-SIN:S1B-077#62:1:B>
How is the development there or is it the other side is actually
sucking up all the money

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-077#63:1:A>
Actually to tell you the truth ya it is sucking quite a lot of
my cash

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-077#64:1:B>
Oh dear I see

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-077#65:1:A>
From here

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-077#66:1:B>
I see

<ICE-SIN:S1B-077#67:1:B>
So if that is the case then I would suggest is that uh but coming
back to the point again it is five I mean it is like what I said

<ICE-SIN:S1B-077#68:1:B>
We are not looking at two hundred thousand although this is uh you
know the initial idea that head office has imposed on your account but I am
looking at a maybe on gradual basis what about five thousand per month

<ICE-SIN:S1B-077#69:1:B>
Do you think you can manage with that for the time being

<ICE-SIN:S1B-077#70:1:B>
So every month we reduce by five thousand lah so over a period of
one year we are looking at sixty thousand because if that is OK then maybe
again I cannot promise you this is this is only uh a decision on my end here

<ICE-SIN:S1B-077#71:1:B>
It may be approved it may not be approved

<ICE-SIN:S1B-077#72:1:B>
But I want to have I want to work out something that is more
comfortable so long as you are comfortable I think that is more important

<ICE-SIN:S1B-077#73:1:B>
At the end of the day you don't over commit yourself to the bank
and then if you are something that you are comfortable you can fulfil I think
that is more important

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-077#74:1:A>
Right I understand that

<ICE-SIN:S1B-077#75:1:A>
Uhm five thousand sounds OK but I may have to like retrench some of
my workers

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-077#76:1:B>
Wah in that case sounds quite bad if it is five thousand but I
think this is the best that I can do This is the best that I can do so uh
anyway we will also take into consideration of the long relationship that you
have with us having bank with us for over the last twenty years beginning
with your father's time

<ICE-SIN:S1B-077#77:1:B>
So I ya ya I will also take in consideration of the possibility of
you know even if you have to retrench some of your staff if you go on a O D
reduction

<ICE-SIN:S1B-077#78:1:B>
Anyway I will try my very best Mr Tan

<ICE-SIN:S1B-077#79:1:B>
What I do is that I will write a short report and then we give it
to we see whether we can come back to you say within a week's time

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-077#80:1:A>
That sounds fine

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-077#81:1:B>
Within a week's time and then we see how we go from there

<ICE-SIN:S1B-077#82:1:B>
If really you have any problem then what we do is that after six
months okay we will come back to you again and well we can sit down and then
discuss further then

<ICE-SIN:S1B-077#83:1:B>
I mean let us hope that the economy will recover by then because
right now the biggest problem that we have is that we actually uh sitting on
a lot of properties like for example these factories that you have now uh
last year when I came in it was something like three point five million and
then today we are looking at two million so straightaway we are looking at a
negative network of about one point five million so this is the biggest
headache that we are facing

<ICE-SIN:S1B-077#84:1:B>
So I think not a problem lah

<ICE-SIN:S1B-077#85:1:B>
Don't worry

<ICE-SIN:S1B-077#86:1:B>
I mean I will come to you in say one week's time and then we see
how we go from there

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-077#87:1:A>
What about your bank

<ICE-SIN:S1B-077#88:1:A>
You said your bank is also affected

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-077#89:1:B>
Oh banks we are affected we are affected

<ICE-SIN:S1B-077#90:1:B>
Uh in fact if you if you read the uh annual reports of all the
local banks we are making hefty provision for the industries so we are badly
hit

<ICE-SIN:S1B-077#91:1:B>
We are badly hit

<ICE-SIN:S1B-077#92:1:B>
So you know we are not spared lah

<ICE-SIN:S1B-077#93:1:B>
Okay we are not spared lah

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-077#94:1:A>
Uhm nice to know that I am not alone in all this

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-077#95:1:B>
You are not spared okay

<ICE-SIN:S1B-077#96:1:B>
We are all business uh private organisations we are not spared but
we have to be prudent huh like living in Singapore we have to be prudent

<ICE-SIN:S1B-077#97:1:B>
We have to again uh we have to protect the interest of our
share-holders, depositors and all that lah but uh well never mind we see how
it will it goes

<ICE-SIN:S1B-077#98:1:B>
More important I think we want to see that we can help our local
enterprise here to ride through this bad times which is the reason why I have
said we are always open for discussion although the intention is to reduce
your OD limit by two hundred thousand but I think we can always look into a
restructured payment

<ICE-SIN:S1B-077#99:1:B>
Five thousand if it is too difficult for you we try it for six
months

<ICE-SIN:S1B-077#100:1:B>
After six months if you really have problems come back to us OK
our doors are open anytime

<ICE-SIN:S1B-077#101:1:B>
My phone is also always there uh you can call me and then we can
have a discussion

<ICE-SIN:S1B-077#102:1:B>
I mean the last thing that we want to do is to force you into
liquidity problem

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-077#103:1:A>
All right thanks

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-077#104:1:B>
Okay thanks Mr Tan uh we will not have lunch this time

<ICE-SIN:S1B-077#105:1:B>
Maybe uh when I come back with you I will come back to you on the
good news the next week we can have lunch together

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-077#106:1:A>
Yes that would be fine

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-077#107:1:B>
Thanks a lot
