<ICE-SIN:S2A-016#1:1:A>
Lim Tong Hai takes his place

<ICE-SIN:S2A-016#2:1:A>
The big question once again who will play in the central mid-field
position

<ICE-SIN:S2A-016#3:1:A>
The last time it was Rafi Ali

<ICE-SIN:S2A-016#4:1:A>
I think Sivaji has kept faith with him and Rafi has taken up a
central mid- field position

<ICE-SIN:S2A-016#5:1:A>
Steven Tan with a ball for Singapore played up wide to Malek Awab

<ICE-SIN:S2A-016#6:1:A>
Van Long it is who picks up Fandi straight away

<ICE-SIN:S2A-016#7:1:A>
No foul says the referee

<ICE-SIN:S2A-016#8:1:A>
That tackle from uh Muiyan Mun Chong of Vietnam

<ICE-SIN:S2A-016#9:1:A>
Malek Awab gets it back for Singapore after a poor pass by Rudin
Tuan

<ICE-SIN:S2A-016#10:1:A>
Fandi against Van Long

<ICE-SIN:S2A-016#11:1:A>
Van Long of course scored against the Philippines and this time it
was his leg that blocked Fandi's cross only for it to go out for a corner to
Singapore

<ICE-SIN:S2A-016#12:1:A>
Lim Tong Hai has been brought back and uh his aerial strength will
be very much needed for this corner kick

<ICE-SIN:S2A-016#13:1:A>
Hit straight to the near post for V Sundram Moorthy but it's the
Vietnamese defender who clears it

<ICE-SIN:S2A-016#14:1:A>
Bin Tuan loses it

<ICE-SIN:S2A-016#15:1:A>
Sundram and it's Van Loong who picks him up again Lim Ter Ang
Sundram leaves it for Malek Awab

<ICE-SIN:S2A-016#16:1:A>
A nice cross by Malek and everybody just misjudging a swing of that
cross that time

<ICE-SIN:S2A-016#17:1:A>
Fandi once again getting free from uh Van Long

<ICE-SIN:S2A-016#18:1:A>
Good play by Fandi Ahmad

<ICE-SIN:S2A-016#19:1:A>
Sundram looking for the ball but the pitch is uh rather heavy it
took a lot of weight off the ball then

<ICE-SIN:S2A-016#20:1:A>
Mun Chong and Van Long clears it only as far as Nazri Nasir who had
a blinder against the Indonesians

<ICE-SIN:S2A-016#21:1:A>
Here's Fandi taken off

<ICE-SIN:S2A-016#22:1:A>
Good tackle by Lim Tong Hai got across very well

<ICE-SIN:S2A-016#23:1:A>
The pitch is wet and uh really an invitation for rough play here
and for Singaporeans would not want to get injured if they are to achieve the
result they desire and qualify for the semi-finals

<ICE-SIN:S2A-016#24:1:A>
Singapore were guilty of some sloppy defending at the match against
the Philippines and for a short while in the first half against the
Indonesians

<ICE-SIN:S2A-016#25:1:A>
They need to tighten up some squeeze at the back

<ICE-SIN:S2A-016#26:1:A>
Fandi is back here little over-indulgence in the style then in a
simple pass to Malek would have done much better

<ICE-SIN:S2A-016#27:1:A>
Losing it all out that was Rafi Ali

<ICE-SIN:S2A-016#28:1:A>
Will the Vietnamese have a chance

<ICE-SIN:S2A-016#29:1:A>
Nice little curler tried by Lu Din Tuan their star striker

<ICE-SIN:S2A-016#30:1:A>
Oh Vietnam besides the first-half show against the Indonesia have
been quite disappointing in this tournament so far

<ICE-SIN:S2A-016#31:1:A>
A coach has put it down to uh a nine o'clock kick off they say
that's usually the time they go to sleep at nine o'clock and they will be
much brighter and alive against Singapore in this seven o'clock game

<ICE-SIN:S2A-016#32:1:A>
Foul on Sundram

<ICE-SIN:S2A-016#33:1:A>
Now there's some space ? ? flings it across in

<ICE-SIN:S2A-016#34:1:A>
Nice ball to Fandi Ahmad who connected with the scissors' kick but
not cleanly though and that came after five minutes of play

<ICE-SIN:S2A-016#35:1:A>
Sundram isn't gonna take this of course he's till nursing a
hamstring injury but he played very well against the Indonesians Sundram

<ICE-SIN:S2A-016#36:1:A>
Got two goals in the tournament so far

<ICE-SIN:S2A-016#37:1:A>
Tong Hai losing out once again Unhung?? for the Vietnamese

<ICE-SIN:S2A-016#38:1:A>
Good sweeping by Razali Said

<ICE-SIN:S2A-016#39:1:A>
But Tong Hai's uh weakness on the ground exposed down there quite
clearly

<ICE-SIN:S2A-016#40:1:A>
Van Mui

<ICE-SIN:S2A-016#41:1:A>
Good play once again by Pang Hung

<ICE-SIN:S2A-016#42:1:A>
The only thing wrong is to keep the ball in play there

<ICE-SIN:S2A-016#43:1:A>
A victim of his own ball control

<ICE-SIN:S2A-016#44:1:A>
Din Ter Ang

<ICE-SIN:S2A-016#45:1:A>
Nazri Nasir showed who showed a lot of enthusiasm against Indonesia
and of course his shot which led to uh Singapore's equaliser in that match

<ICE-SIN:S2A-016#46:1:A>
Fan Mui for Vietnam now

<ICE-SIN:S2A-016#47:1:A>
Here's Dian Dung

<ICE-SIN:S2A-016#48:1:A>
Steven will pick him up and does well Steven

<ICE-SIN:S2A-016#49:1:A>
Gets the ball back from momentarily loses it again

<ICE-SIN:S2A-016#50:1:A>
Dian Dung outside it's a goal kick to Singapore

<ICE-SIN:S2A-016#51:1:A>
Well they've they attacked very well down the right flank but they
have to watch the right flank as well because the Vietnamese are using this
flank for most of their attacks too

<ICE-SIN:S2A-016#52:1:A>
Saswa Love is over overlapping once

<ICE-SIN:S2A-016#53:1:A>
Sin Hian Ter Ang

<ICE-SIN:S2A-016#54:1:A>
Should be Razali's ball and Nazri to Rafi who loses it in midfield
but gains it back

<ICE-SIN:S2A-016#55:1:A>
Sundram nice pass by V Sundram Moorthy

<ICE-SIN:S2A-016#56:1:A>
Sasswa ? ? for Singapore

<ICE-SIN:S2A-016#57:1:A>
Easily tackled then by Muiyan Man Chong

<ICE-SIN:S2A-016#58:1:A>
Good play once again by Nazri

<ICE-SIN:S2A-016#59:1:A>
A rather harsh decision by the referee then he came in very
strongly well that's Nazri for you

<ICE-SIN:S2A-016#60:1:A>
A very uncompromising player

<ICE-SIN:S2A-016#61:1:A>
Tong Hai does well to clear and all the Singaporeans claim

<ICE-SIN:S2A-016#62:1:A>
Referee says play on

<ICE-SIN:S2A-016#63:1:A>
Lovely back field by Malek Awab and a nice cool pass by Steven Tan
looking out for the runner Fandi Ahmad

<ICE-SIN:S2A-016#64:1:A>
Fandi does so very well to keep the ball in play

<ICE-SIN:S2A-016#65:1:A>
Magnificent skills by him

<ICE-SIN:S2A-016#66:1:A>
Determination getting him a little further before the ball goes out

<ICE-SIN:S2A-016#67:1:A>
You can see Fandi is a little bit subservient by the close
attention he's getting from the Vietnamese

<ICE-SIN:S2A-016#68:1:A>
A ? ? home support

<ICE-SIN:S2A-016#69:1:A>
It's gone to Fandi again though and that shot by <?> Saswa </?> went far
wide

<ICE-SIN:S2A-016#70:1:A>
He's drawn in very well with the offensive work Saswa Dematha?? but
whether he's upfront he tends to abandon his ? ? right back

<ICE-SIN:S2A-016#71:1:A>
Same as in the case of uh E Mani Mohan

<ICE-SIN:S2A-016#72:1:A>
Suan Phan Van Mui

<ICE-SIN:S2A-016#73:1:A>
Good pass Tong Tong Tam

<ICE-SIN:S2A-016#74:1:A>
A little bit of uh confusion then and Vietnam win their first
corner via a touch of Steven Tan

<ICE-SIN:S2A-016#75:1:A>
Eleven minutes of play gone by

<ICE-SIN:S2A-016#76:1:A>
Nil nil Singapore Vietnam

<ICE-SIN:S2A-016#77:1:A>
Good one real one by Steven Tan

<ICE-SIN:S2A-016#78:1:A>
Kian Dong Rafi gets committed himself in very vulnerable tackle by
Rafi Ali

<ICE-SIN:S2A-016#79:1:A>
It move pass everybody and straight to Malek Awab

<ICE-SIN:S2A-016#80:1:A>
Good work by Mui Yan Van Loong

<ICE-SIN:S2A-016#81:1:A>
But Singapore playing them on side

<ICE-SIN:S2A-016#82:1:A>
Here's a chance for Phan Hung

<ICE-SIN:S2A-016#83:1:A>
Good work by Steven Tan though who did enough to uh push the body
Phan Hung aside and narrow the angle for the shot in

<ICE-SIN:S2A-016#84:1:A>
Singapore scored four goals against Vietnam in two matches exceeded
two as well

<ICE-SIN:S2A-016#85:1:A>
Steven read that one pretty well

<ICE-SIN:S2A-016#86:1:A>
Rafi who scored a solitary goal

<ICE-SIN:S2A-016#87:1:A>
Uh that was a very poor pass by Rafi though especially if you're
playing in the play maker's role

<ICE-SIN:S2A-016#88:1:A>
Nazri lasted for a short while and to <?> Saswa </?>

<ICE-SIN:S2A-016#89:1:A>
That's a much better ball by Nazri Nasir

<ICE-SIN:S2A-016#90:1:A>
Three waiting for the cross from Saswa

<ICE-SIN:S2A-016#91:1:A>
One of them is Fandi Ahmad

<ICE-SIN:S2A-016#92:1:A>
But the goalkeeper comes out very well to meet it Malek trying to
get a first hand cross back inside

<ICE-SIN:S2A-016#93:1:A>
Fandi does very well

<ICE-SIN:S2A-016#94:1:A>
It's a penalty Yes

<ICE-SIN:S2A-016#95:1:A>
A little cruel on the decision oh no

<ICE-SIN:S2A-016#96:1:A>
Well actually the referee pointed the the cross to them but he
pointed to the place where the goal kick should be taken got the crowd

<ICE-SIN:S2A-016#97:1:A>
A lot of people in the commentary booth were excited for a short
while

<ICE-SIN:S2A-016#98:1:A>
It was a really a teaser by

<ICE-SIN:S2A-016#99:1:A>
It must be heartening for P M Sivaji to know that uh our crosses
down the flanks

<ICE-SIN:S2A-016#100:1:A>
Uh Saswa Steven and Malek can knock in very accurate ones

<ICE-SIN:S2A-016#101:1:A>
A very bad tackle on Fandi Ahmad that time by Mui Yan Van Long

<ICE-SIN:S2A-016#102:1:A>
They're certainly aiming for his ankle

<ICE-SIN:S2A-016#103:1:A>
We read about it and uh Bin Ter Ang that's a silly way to get the
yellow card really

<ICE-SIN:S2A-016#104:1:A>
Ter Hung Well a yellow card well surely mean that they'll be a bit
more cautious with this tackling and that can only do Singapore some good

<ICE-SIN:S2A-016#105:1:A>
At the moment Vietnam have possession of the ball

<ICE-SIN:S2A-016#106:1:A>
Sixty minutes of play gone by still deadlock at nil nil Singapore
and Vietnam

<ICE-SIN:S2A-016#107:1:A>
A very bright opening quarter of an hour

<ICE-SIN:S2A-016#108:1:A>
Nice little dummy play then by Din Tuan finding Kan Hoong back to
Dintuan

<ICE-SIN:S2A-016#109:1:A>
Good skills by Loo Dintuan

<ICE-SIN:S2A-016#110:1:A>
The cut-back though was not just as good

<ICE-SIN:S2A-016#111:1:A>
Onside Sundram and Fandi chasing for this

<ICE-SIN:S2A-016#112:1:A>
Also with them is Mui Yan Van Loong who panicked and just lifted
the ball high and wide

<ICE-SIN:S2A-016#113:1:A>
Fandi to Malek and then to Sundram Moorthy

<ICE-SIN:S2A-016#114:1:A>
Easy little ball play outside to Rafi and a sensible pass down to
Steven Tan

<ICE-SIN:S2A-016#115:1:A>
Once again Malek great what a cross and he gets behind it

<ICE-SIN:S2A-016#116:1:A>
Malek Awab the Vietnamese claim it was outside

<ICE-SIN:S2A-016#117:1:A>
But it's the Singapore fans who stand up and cheer

<ICE-SIN:S2A-016#118:1:A>
Well done Malek Awab

<ICE-SIN:S2A-016#119:1:A>
That's a ? ? coming from the blind side meeting across very well
and placing it into the net

<ICE-SIN:S2A-016#120:1:A>
Sizzling effort then

<ICE-SIN:S2A-016#121:1:A>
Six players involved in that Sundram Malek Fandi Saswa who made
the initial clearance

<ICE-SIN:S2A-016#122:1:A>
Rafi Ali who made the pass to Steven and the cross from Steven was
magnificent

<ICE-SIN:S2A-016#123:1:A>
Well good play by Loo Din Tuan who certainly is a more dangerous
player Bin Tuan

<ICE-SIN:S2A-016#124:1:A>
Magnificent skills from him that time the lovely turn around

<ICE-SIN:S2A-016#125:1:A>
At that time describing him as Maradona was certainly apt

<ICE-SIN:S2A-016#126:1:A>
Malek Awab who had trouble scoring for Singapore prior to the SEA
Games have now got two goals in this competition

<ICE-SIN:S2A-016#127:1:A>
And the Vietnamese defenders are very weary of the two Singapore
front runners

<ICE-SIN:S2A-016#128:1:A>
The ball has played nobody was chasing them but they seem to be
very apprehensive about you know clearing the ball or just leaving it for the
goalkeeper

<ICE-SIN:S2A-016#129:1:A>
They were in two minds then

<ICE-SIN:S2A-016#130:1:A>
Malek Awab a nice ball

<ICE-SIN:S2A-016#131:1:A>
He's playing a superb match at the moment Malek Awab

<ICE-SIN:S2A-016#132:1:A>
He's almost everywhere and he's got the gold as well

<ICE-SIN:S2A-016#133:1:A>
At the moment the star on the pitch outstanding player

<ICE-SIN:S2A-016#134:1:A>
He's the oldest the player in this squat and also the fittest

<ICE-SIN:S2A-016#135:1:A>
Sundram Nazri dummy taking the back view then distributing it to
Malek Awab

<ICE-SIN:S2A-016#136:1:A>
Mohan trying a little skill from Sundram Moorthy then but just
couldn't do it

<ICE-SIN:S2A-016#137:1:A>
The Vietnamese playing a very tight situation here and Singapore ? ?
clearing it out but Steven Tan gave it away

<ICE-SIN:S2A-016#138:1:A>
Din Tuan will get to this first before Nazri Nasir

<ICE-SIN:S2A-016#139:1:A>
Play on says the referee a fair challenge

<ICE-SIN:S2A-016#140:1:A>
For one thing Din Tuan doesn't have if you compare to Maradona is
the size really

<ICE-SIN:S2A-016#141:1:A>
Zian Dong

<ICE-SIN:S2A-016#142:1:A>
Good tackle by Rafi Ali

<ICE-SIN:S2A-016#143:1:A>
He's run the balls in mid-field fairly well but he needs to
redistribute them that's why he's place there by P N Sivaji

<ICE-SIN:S2A-016#144:1:A>
E Mani Mohan twenty-five year old full-back for Geylang
International

<ICE-SIN:S2A-016#145:1:A>
Looking for his opponent Geylang team-mate Fandi Ahmad there

<ICE-SIN:S2A-016#146:1:A>
Van Mui Man Cheong Ter Ang Ter Ang once again from Vietnam

<ICE-SIN:S2A-016#147:1:A>
This is Suan Tan

<ICE-SIN:S2A-016#148:1:A>
Easily cut up by Malek Awab again

<ICE-SIN:S2A-016#149:1:A>
Look at that pace swung there by Malek Fantastic

<ICE-SIN:S2A-016#150:1:A>
Good work once again by Malek Awab <unclear> word </unclear> a lot
of skill

<ICE-SIN:S2A-016#151:1:A>
In fact it's been him who has been doing most of the clearances in
defence

<ICE-SIN:S2A-016#152:1:A>
And he wins a free kick

<ICE-SIN:S2A-016#153:1:A>
He's doing everything right this evening

<ICE-SIN:S2A-016#154:1:A>
Scored against the Philippines

<ICE-SIN:S2A-016#155:1:A>
He scored the only goal of the game so far

<ICE-SIN:S2A-016#156:1:A>
Not a very good cross from him though

<ICE-SIN:S2A-016#157:1:A>
Razali Said pushing it straight inside thinking that Fandi will
get at the end of it

<ICE-SIN:S2A-016#158:1:A>
Here is E Mani Mohan

<ICE-SIN:S2A-016#159:1:A>
He's got Malek to support and he loses Fandi again

<ICE-SIN:S2A-016#160:1:A>
Nazri gets to it very well but loses it

<ICE-SIN:S2A-016#161:1:A>
Well won back by Rafi and that's a fantastic ball by Rafi Ali

<ICE-SIN:S2A-016#162:1:A>
Fandi plays it back nicely to Malek Awab

<ICE-SIN:S2A-016#163:1:A>
Had to push it in between the two defenders who try to get Sundram
Moorthy to it Rafi Fandi to <unclear>

<ICE-SIN:S2A-016#164:1:A>
Vietnamese player taste of his own medicine

<ICE-SIN:S2A-016#165:1:A>
This is Tian Dong Ter Nam Mun Dong Bin Tuan

<ICE-SIN:S2A-016#166:1:A>
The goalkeeper not a very good clearance from him

<ICE-SIN:S2A-016#167:1:A>
That's a much better that one

<ICE-SIN:S2A-016#168:1:A>
Poor header by <?> Saswa </?> finally cleared by Steven

<ICE-SIN:S2A-016#169:1:A>
Saswa easily taken over

<ICE-SIN:S2A-016#170:1:A>
Oh wonderful tackle that time by Rafi Ali but the referee says it
was illegal

<ICE-SIN:S2A-016#171:1:A>
And after twenty-five minutes Singapore one nil up but they've
given away a free-kick

<ICE-SIN:S2A-016#172:1:A>
Tong Hai will leave this one and Abdul Malek will take the goal
kick

<ICE-SIN:S2A-016#173:1:A>
So Malek Awab score separating the two sides <X>

<ICE-SIN:S2A-016#X174:1:A>
E Mony Mohan V Sundram Moorthy It's a very adventurious ball by
Sundram trying to look for Nazri then The Vietnamese have got Din Tuan

<ICE-SIN:S2A-016#X175:1:A>
Nice little chemistry there shown between Fandi and Sundram
Sundram Moorthy Rafi This is nice football by Singapore Saswa who look for
Fandi with the cross They're too many players in front of him there Sundram
Steven waiting for the ball Poor ball control by Steven Sundram again Fandi
is a little bit angered upfront because they're waiting too long for the
cross Rafi with a good shot at goal Nicely done Good play by Fandi as well to
hold up </X> </I>
