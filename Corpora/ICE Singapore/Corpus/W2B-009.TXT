<h> Introduction </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-009#4:1>
December 8, 1991 will be the 50th anniversary of the Japanese War.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-009#5:1>
Nearly half a century would have passed since the first bombs fell in
Singapore.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-009#6:1>
What took me so long to write my memoirs of the Japanese occupation?

<ICE-SIN:W2B-009#7:1>
That is the question I have been asked very often.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-009#8:1>
As a matter of fact, I had no intention at all of doing so.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-009#9:1>
It had been the most unpleasant period of my life, so full of
vicissitudes, pain and suffering that I cannot look back at it without
thanking the good Lord for helping me to emerge from it unscathed and
unharmed.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-009#10:1>
So why dig up the past and relive the horrors of War?

<ICE-SIN:W2B-009#11:1>
Why re-experience the terror of the night when the first bombs fell
on Singapore or be reminded of the abject fear, the suspense and the anxiety
in subsequent bombings and shellings when we faced the prospect of possible
annihilation?

<ICE-SIN:W2B-009#12:1>
We had as much control of our fate as an upturned cockroach, all six
legs kicking vigorously in the air but helplessly unable to move away from
danger as it sees a huge foot descending to trample it to death.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-009#13:1>
Why not forget entirely the atrocities, the indignities and the
hardship we had suffered during the Occupation?

<ICE-SIN:W2B-009#14:1>
We had been living in peace and amity with our former enemies for a
long time now.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-009#15:1>
They had already paid their debt to society, the perpetrators of war
time atrocities had already been punished; the whole nation had suffered the
humiliation of defeat and surrender.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-009#16:1>
Is it wise to reactivate the memories of their misdoings and rekindle
the flames of racial hatred?

<ICE-SIN:W2B-009#17:1>
My purpose in memoralising this event is to remind us of the futility
of war, of the fact that it had not achieved anything materialistically
except to take away millions of lives.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-009#18:1>
Meditate on the lengths to which the human animal, oblivious to all
the finer feelings of humaneness, amity and brotherly love, will go in his
attempt to annihilate his enemy.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-009#19:1>
Remember the huge sums of money spent on ammunitions that could have
been diverted for peaceful purposes.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-009#20:1>
Reflect on the horrific destructive power of the Atomic Bomb as it
devastated the entire city of Hiroshima in a matter of minutes.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-009#21:1>
Let us pray to God that such a calamity will never happen again and
that He will prevail on our rulers to come forth to a Conference Table to
discuss plans for banning the Atomic Bomb, and promoting permanent world
peace.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-009#22:1>
Let them persist with their talks instead of breaking off now and
then until these ends are achieved.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-009#23:1>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-009#24:1>
September 1991

<ICE-SIN:W2B-009#25:1>
<h> 1. Air-Raid </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-009#26:1>
December 8th, 1941 is a date that I shall never forget.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-009#27:1>
I was sleeping fitfully in the early hours of that morning when two
loud explosions woke me.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-009#28:1>
" Air-raid," shouted my wife Kay, and we rushed out of bed to our
makeshift shelter - a stout table in the corridor with a mattress under it.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-009#29:1>
My brother who had been sleeping out on the veranda followed suit.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-009#30:1>
He averred that he had seen flames in the direction of the FMS Hostel
for Medical Students barely a mile away from our house and heard loud
explosions.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-009#31:1>
As we waited we could hear the low drone of planes approaching - a
sound new to us.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-009#32:1>
Presently the planes passed overhead and we steeled ourselves for the
bombs which might follow, but they did not.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-009#33:1>
Instead, the planes flew on, and we heard the sound of anti-aircraft
fire.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-009#34:1>
Some distance away, they dropped more bombs and then there was
silence.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-009#35:1>
Only then did the air-raid siren sound the " alert" indicating that
an air-raid was in progress.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-009#36:1>
There was a long wait for the " all clear" signal and we had time to
reflect on our plight.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-009#37:1>
The planes were probably Japanese.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-009#38:1>
BBC had earlier reported that a large convoy of Japanese ships had
bee sighted in the Gulf of Siam but speculation was rife as to their
intentions.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-009#39:1>
Were they going to attack Siam or would the convoy head south for
Singapore?

<ICE-SIN:W2B-009#40:1>
If so, we were prepared for such an invasion.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-009#41:1>
The entire southern coast bristled with machine guns inside stout
pill-boxes, some parts were mined and the whole area was strewn with barbed
wire defenses.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-009#42:1>
Also, our guns at Blakang Mati could easily outrange any naval guns
that the Japanese navy could deploy.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-009#43:1>
Besides that, we had two large warships defending our coast - the
battleship Prince of Wales and the battle cruiser Repulse.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-009#44:1>
Therefore we felt safe from invasion.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-009#45:1>
Soon the long awaited " all clear" signal was heard and almost
immediately my phone rang and I was summoned to the Admission Room of our
hospital to attend to casualties that had started to pour in.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-009#46:1>
I hurried over and upon arrival I was appalled at what I saw.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-009#47:1>
The Admission Room was meant to take only two cases at a time but was
now chock-full of casualties.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-009#48:1>
There were at least a dozen cases waiting to be admitted.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-009#49:1>
The room reeked of blood, burnt flesh and gunpowder and looked more
like a charnel house than a hospital.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-009#50:1>
Wounds of every description could be found among the casualties -
deep gashes, small puncture wounds, burns fractures, protruding viscera, etc.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-009#51:1>
I suddenly realised that I had the distinction of being the first
doctor in Singapore to attend to casualties in this first air-raid.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-009#52:1>
Later, other doctors came to help and I left for my assignment as an
anaesthetist in the Operation Theatre.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-009#53:1>
I arrived at D Theatre in the midst of a flurry of activity.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-009#54:1>
The chief surgeon had not yet arrived, but almost everybody else was
there including my young assistant, a quiet medical student with whom I had
had a few practice sessions before.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-009#55:1>
A diligent and intelligent young man, I expected great things out of
him.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-009#56:1>
( I was not disappointed for after the war, he became Professor of
Bacteriology, one of the first Asians to hold such a high post in the local
university).

<ICE-SIN:W2B-009#57:1>
Soon the chief surgeon arrived and work continued in earnest.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-009#58:1>
To save time, I delegated patients to my assistant during the last
stages of the operation ( the " stitching up" as it was called).

<ICE-SIN:W2B-009#59:1>
I would then proceed with the induction of the next case.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-009#60:1>
I remember feeling sorry for these initial casualties who had done
nothing to deserve such terrible punishment - their only fault being that
they happened to be in the path of the falling bombs.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-009#61:1>
I reflected that it was just the beginning and that in the days to
come, more would suffer, perhaps hundreds, perhaps thousands.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-009#62:1>
From all walks of life they would come, both male and female, and of
all ages - from the " mewling and puking infant" to the old man with one foot
in the grave - all victims of unprovoked attacks, all sufferers from
indiscriminate bombings.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-009#63:1>
The wounds sustained by the casualties were ugly and cruel-looking,
many contaminated with dirt, debris or foreign matter.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-009#64:1>
Some of the lesions were large and evil-looking, big gashes in the
body, but fortunately not deep enough to destroy any vital structure.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-009#65:1>
Others consisted of complicated fractures of the bones, the spine or
the skull and yet others consisted of small entry wounds concealing gross
destruction of the internal organs such as ruptured intestines, liver or lung
- destruction so great that the surgeon could do nothing to help except to
sew up the incision and send the patient back to ward to die - mute
testimonies of Man's gross inhumanity to man.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-009#66:1>
We were so busy that we lost all track of time.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-009#67:1>
The operation theatre curtains were drawn because of blackout
procedures and we had no means of distinguishing night from day except for
the wall clock.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-009#68:1>
During a lull in our activities, we chanced to look at the clock and
to our surprise, the time was 9.00 a.m.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-009#69:1>
The chief promptly declared a recess of one hour for breakfast.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-009#70:1>
As I emerged into the bright sunlight outside the theatre, I spied a
colleague with a newspaper under his arm.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-009#71:1>
I made a beeline for him and all but grabbed the newspaper from him.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-009#72:1>
There, on the front page was the caption: Japan declares war on
Britain and the USA.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-009#73:1>
Japan had ushered in hostilities by bombing Pearl Harbour and landing
troops in Kota Bahru, Singora and Patani on the east coast of the Siamese -
Malayan Peninsula.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-009#74:1>
Before this I had never heard of Pearl Harbour.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-009#75:1>
I thought at first that must be a harbour at the mouth of the Pearl
River in Canton, China, until I read further and realised that it was a great
US naval base in Honolulu, Hawaii.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-009#76:1>
I knew of course where Kota Bahru, Singora and Patani were.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-009#77:1>
They were supposed have been strongly defended.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-009#78:1>
The Japanese were reported to be proceeding in two columns - one
westwards and the other southwards, spreading fear and panic as they
advanced.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-009#79:1>
As I was pondering over this information, I noticed a small group of
Europeans huddled outside the theatre.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-009#80:1>
They all looked decidedly dishabille and what clothes they had on
were crumpled.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-009#81:1>
One of them was clad only in a sarong and was bare from the waist
upwards, his hairy torso glistening with sweat.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-009#82:1>
I thought he was one of those Europeans who had " gone native." It
transpired that they were refugees from the east coast of Malaya - doctors
and nurses who had been hurriedly evacuated with no time to pack and most of
them had left with only what they were wearing: he of the bare torso was one
of them.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-009#83:1>
I found out later, however, that he wore this peculiar accoutrement
by choice for I later saw him operating in this peculiar outfit - cap, mask,
gloves, sarong and sans everything else.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-009#84:1>
It was his way of beating the tropical heat and his method of
air-conditioning.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-009#85:1>
The chief medical officer ( CMO) then made his appearance.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-009#86:1>
He was a rather short for a European, and inclined to embonpoint.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-009#87:1>
He had sandy-coloured hair and a sandy-coloured moustache,
clipped short in military fashion.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-009#88:1>
Dressed him in a white shirt, khaki shorts, stockings and shoes to
match and a toupee or solar hat and he would be the very model of the
colonial gentleman out of the pages of Punch.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-009#89:1>
( " Gad, sir, the country is going to the dogs, what?").

<ICE-SIN:W2B-009#90:1>
At that moment, he was looking rather worried, and to test the
official reaction to the war, I ventured the following gambit, " Do you think
our chaps can clear up this mess before Christmas?

<ICE-SIN:W2B-009#91:1>
" Eh?" he replied absent-mindedly.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-009#92:1>
" Why, sure, of course".

<ICE-SIN:W2B-009#93:1>
( Must show a stiff upper lip, y'know).

<ICE-SIN:W2B-009#94:1>
This was about the time the nurses returned from breakfast and we
soon saw the matron in her distinctive blue uniform coming towards us
followed by a bevy of young nurses on their way to their respective wards.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-009#95:1>
It gave the CMO an opportunity to break off his conversation with me
and save himself from further embarrassing questions.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-009#96:1>
He turned to Matron and instructed her to enforce strict blackout
regulations in all the wards at all times during the night, irrespective of
whether there was an " alert" or not.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-009#97:1>
On hearing this, one sweet young thing clapped with joy and
exclaimed, " Oh, goody, goody, we are going to have a blackout dance this
Christmas." - a remark which remained me that Christmas was only seventeen
days away.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-009#98:1>
I hurried back to my quarters and found that Kay too had just
returned from the hospital.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-009#99:1>
Over breakfast, we exchanged accounts of our experiences in the past
few hours.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-009#100:1>
At 7 a.m., Kay had been summoned to her emergency station in Ward 2
of the Upper Block.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-009#101:1>
In normal times, this was the second class ward, but due to the
emergency, it was thrown open to all classes of casualties.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-009#102:1>
( Apparently Japanese bombs could not only level buildings but also
class barriers). <X>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-009#X103:1>
Although Kay had not done casualties since her student days, she
was not the squeamish sort.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-009#X104:1>
Apart from the usual run of wounds and fractures, there were also
quite a number of burn cases. </X> </I>
