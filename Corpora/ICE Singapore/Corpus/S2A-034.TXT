<ICE-SIN:S2A-034#1:1:A>
Thank you mister chairman

<ICE-SIN:S2A-034#2:1:A>
Well I'm not going to talk about you know sexual problems or things
like that tonight

<ICE-SIN:S2A-034#3:1:A>
But uhm the talk is actually on stress management strategy and uh I
shall make it a very practical session

<ICE-SIN:S2A-034#4:1:A>
So afterwards you know you all will have to have maybe you space
yourself out and shift the chairs a little because you will need some room

<ICE-SIN:S2A-034#5:1:A>
We're going to uh go through a few of the techniques and there are
different types

<ICE-SIN:S2A-034#6:1:A>
Uhm I shan't be doing too much theory but I thought you know perhaps
you know I'll just have this one transparency we talk about stresses and the
general concept of stress

<ICE-SIN:S2A-034#7:1:A>
So basically you know there's for any individual lah you have the
stressor

<ICE-SIN:S2A-034#8:1:A>
The stressor can be anything depends on each person

<ICE-SIN:S2A-034#9:1:A>
It could be your family your marriage your work relationship
anything you know that stresses you

<ICE-SIN:S2A-034#10:1:A>
We call the stressor

<ICE-SIN:S2A-034#11:1:A>
And then you know you go to this uh through different interfaces
with one self and with that person himself

<ICE-SIN:S2A-034#12:1:A>
So first you have got the appraisal how you look at stress or maybe
you look at the situation

<ICE-SIN:S2A-034#13:1:A>
Let's say you've got an exam uhm or you know your husband is going
to leave you or your work in office due to over work and all that

<ICE-SIN:S2A-034#14:1:A>
How do you appraise it and appraisal maybe it depends on how you
look at things

<ICE-SIN:S2A-034#15:1:A>
Some things you see as unpleasant some things are challenging some
things are threatening

<ICE-SIN:S2A-034#16:1:A>
And this depends on lots of other factors you know

<ICE-SIN:S2A-034#17:1:A>
On what that has happen in the past you know

<ICE-SIN:S2A-034#18:1:A>
How you face the si stimulus situation how you face exams or how
you face work stress or how you face you know quarrel with your husband that
sort of things

<ICE-SIN:S2A-034#19:1:A>
So and it depends on also your knowledge you know knowledge about a
certain thing how much you think you know about the situation as subject in a
way you've experience of it

<ICE-SIN:S2A-034#20:1:A>
Your judgement of it you know

<ICE-SIN:S2A-034#21:1:A>
You're judging it and as you know being serious not too serious
moderately serious is it okay it's not too bad and all that

<ICE-SIN:S2A-034#22:1:A>
Uh then things like you know how predictable it is lah

<ICE-SIN:S2A-034#23:1:A>
If it's something that comes on in a very predictably and you know
the outcome

<ICE-SIN:S2A-034#24:1:A>
You know what's going to be like then your reaction is going to be
different as from something that just comes out of the blue

<ICE-SIN:S2A-034#25:1:A>
If it's terrible it's your fault and then you know you don't have
anything to guide you and there's a situation

<ICE-SIN:S2A-034#26:1:A>
What's the situation surrounded surrounding this uh ? ? this uh
stress at the moment okay

<ICE-SIN:S2A-034#27:1:A>
So this one uh is going to then you look at the outcome uh what you
expect of the outcome

<ICE-SIN:S2A-034#28:1:A>
Uh you think it's going to be a good outcome or bad outcome

<ICE-SIN:S2A-034#29:1:A>
So probably you know we do that lah most of the time but probably
we don't have it in a structure

<ICE-SIN:S2A-034#30:1:A>
But you generally like some sort of expectation

<ICE-SIN:S2A-034#31:1:A>
I think it's terrible suppose to be collapsing soon uh I will not
be able to survive it and then it's going to be so bad I think I better end
my life

<ICE-SIN:S2A-034#32:1:A>
So that will become someone expecting the worse outcome

<ICE-SIN:S2A-034#33:1:A>
Well you think well perhaps it's not so bad that type of thing then
uhm you look at the you know efficacy of expectations uh whether you think
you know how efficacious uh certain things are going to be

<ICE-SIN:S2A-034#34:1:A>
You know what strategies what you're going use and whether it's
going to be useful or not

<ICE-SIN:S2A-034#35:1:A>
And the commitments that you have uhm in relation to that stress

<ICE-SIN:S2A-034#36:1:A>
Uh what commitments do you have to that situation and that will
help you decide you know

<ICE-SIN:S2A-034#37:1:A>
Because your options are going to give them what commitment you
have

<ICE-SIN:S2A-034#38:1:A>
If you are overly committed or heavily committed then you may be
able to you may be unable to you know have the option of leaving that stress
or that stressful situation

<ICE-SIN:S2A-034#39:1:A>
Now other things will be on your personality and here a lot of work
has been done

<ICE-SIN:S2A-034#40:1:A>
So uhm you all may have heard of the type A and type B type of
personality

<ICE-SIN:S2A-034#41:1:A>
There has been a lot of work done and initially it was use you know

<ICE-SIN:S2A-034#42:1:A>
Almost about uh two three decades ago about you know cardiac
disorders you know cardiac disorders and the type A type of personality

<ICE-SIN:S2A-034#43:1:A>
So that you know it was represented with a clench fist and a and a
stopwatch uh

<ICE-SIN:S2A-034#44:1:A>
If they say those who are most prone to mild cardiac problems lah
uh let's say infarctions heart attacks and all that

<ICE-SIN:S2A-034#45:1:A>
They're the ones who are very very tense

<ICE-SIN:S2A-034#46:1:A>
They're very ambitious they are very impatient and uh they have to
do things all the time on the go

<ICE-SIN:S2A-034#47:1:A>
And that's why you have this clench fist and suggesting a lot of
tension inner tension and also the stop watch

<ICE-SIN:S2A-034#48:1:A>
A stop watch has seen a lot of Singaporeans and a stop watch in
their minds that means everything must be done on time

<ICE-SIN:S2A-034#49:1:A>
If the thing is a bit slow uhm certain things happen they become
very frustrated and they're very uptight about it

<ICE-SIN:S2A-034#50:1:A>
So this is the type A personality and it was found that within type
A personality you are prone to uhm cardiac problems

<ICE-SIN:S2A-034#51:1:A>
But now in the whole context has been widen so that they look at
this personality and gastric ulcer this personality and a lot of variety of
things

<ICE-SIN:S2A-034#52:1:A>
So basically if you do have that part if you can uh then you can
change it uh preferably to the type B personality

<ICE-SIN:S2A-034#53:1:A>
Type B is the opposite of it

<ICE-SIN:S2A-034#54:1:A>
You're very laid back you don't care till you know sky can come
down and say well it's not too bad and all that

<ICE-SIN:S2A-034#55:1:A>
So gives him a very laid back type of personality and probably in
terms of the Singapore context

<ICE-SIN:S2A-034#56:1:A>
If you're too type B again I suppose it's not too good

<ICE-SIN:S2A-034#57:1:A>
Okay but anyway this is the personality type that you have and the
other one is the locus of control again

<ICE-SIN:S2A-034#58:1:A>
A lot of work has been done

<ICE-SIN:S2A-034#59:1:A>
Well this uh control basically means that a situation happens how
much are you in control of it

<ICE-SIN:S2A-034#60:1:A>
Can you control or you can't control it

<ICE-SIN:S2A-034#61:1:A>
Okay whether let's say uhm examinations can you control the outcome
or not

<ICE-SIN:S2A-034#62:1:A>
Generally I think where exams are concerned ah we have quite a good
locus of control

<ICE-SIN:S2A-034#63:1:A>
Basically I mean if you have uhm let's say sufficient you have the
intellectual level and you know you know you study hard and you go through
the past question

<ICE-SIN:S2A-034#64:1:A>
Your chances of passing should be about ninety per cent

<ICE-SIN:S2A-034#65:1:A>
There'll be ten per cent chance of failing

<ICE-SIN:S2A-034#66:1:A>
You may not do you may not reach A but your chances of passing are
good

<ICE-SIN:S2A-034#67:1:A>
So your locus of control is good

<ICE-SIN:S2A-034#68:1:A>
But suppose you know you go into a situation where the external
locus of your control is an external locus of control

<ICE-SIN:S2A-034#69:1:A>
That means you're working in a situation where you have a very
erratic boss everything depends on him

<ICE-SIN:S2A-034#70:1:A>
He's very high-sailing but he's very erratic and you don't know
where you stand you have to look at the face

<ICE-SIN:S2A-034#71:1:A>
One day he's happy the other day he's not

<ICE-SIN:S2A-034#72:1:A>
So he gives you that type of stress it can be very bad

<ICE-SIN:S2A-034#73:1:A>
I think of some people those who have been in the army sometimes
you know you face uh uh a difficult ? ?

<ICE-SIN:S2A-034#74:1:A>
He may give you hell because you may not be able to predict

<ICE-SIN:S2A-034#75:1:A>
It's totally out of your control

<ICE-SIN:S2A-034#76:1:A>
So in that situation you can feel very helpless and the stress can
be great

<ICE-SIN:S2A-034#77:1:A>
And another thing at the end a lot of work being done on social
support

<ICE-SIN:S2A-034#78:1:A>
What we know is that the more support you have the better you are
able to cope

<ICE-SIN:S2A-034#79:1:A>
So let's say now the stressor you go through this and then you look
at your coping strategies ah

<ICE-SIN:S2A-034#80:1:A>
There are different types of coping strategies

<ICE-SIN:S2A-034#81:1:A>
One is problem focus one is emotion focus

<ICE-SIN:S2A-034#82:1:A>
We'll go through the strategies later and that depends your outcome
depends on that

<ICE-SIN:S2A-034#83:1:A>
If it's a bad outcome you will get your either psychological
problem uh into well I was talking suicidal behaviour and all that

<ICE-SIN:S2A-034#84:1:A>
And even you know while it was mention sexual disorders uhm you can
get physical problems

<ICE-SIN:S2A-034#85:1:A>
And physical problems can be anything because uh lots of things are
actually in a way the relationship between strength and ailment

<ICE-SIN:S2A-034#86:1:A>
There are several what we call psychosomatic disorders

<ICE-SIN:S2A-034#87:1:A>
That means you're quite related to stress and others which are a
bit more diffused ah

<ICE-SIN:S2A-034#88:1:A>
But again a lot of work is being done on that

<ICE-SIN:S2A-034#89:1:A>
Or if you have been all these factors are good then your outcome
can be satisfactory

<ICE-SIN:S2A-034#90:1:A>
Right so this is uh a basic uhm outcome of the concept of stress

<ICE-SIN:S2A-034#91:1:A>
And now we will go straight into the management strategy

<ICE-SIN:S2A-034#92:1:A>
I shall be dealing you know with uh two of these and not all of
them

<ICE-SIN:S2A-034#93:1:A>
Now these are the general ones as in relaxation hypnosis and
imagery and tonight

<ICE-SIN:S2A-034#94:1:A>
I would like to cover it and then later on we go onto the more
cognitive ones

<ICE-SIN:S2A-034#95:1:A>
How do you change your way of thinking

<ICE-SIN:S2A-034#96:1:A>
So the first one is uh is relaxation therapy and uhm perhaps you
know if you can do now can you all shift around uh so that you have enough
space uh to be able to stick your legs out

<ICE-SIN:S2A-034#97:1:A>
Now the issue of relaxation therapy is that you know you have to
learn how to relax and you have to relax your muscles ah

<ICE-SIN:S2A-034#98:1:A>
So this one is what we call the peripheral method meaning that you
know the theory is that if your muscles are relaxed you're going to be able
to relax okay

<ICE-SIN:S2A-034#99:1:A>
Some people will find that you know it is so if they relax muscles
then they can relax themselves

<ICE-SIN:S2A-034#100:1:A>
But some people may not be able to do that and that's why we have
you know different other techniques later on

<ICE-SIN:S2A-034#101:1:A>
Okay so initially this was started by Jacobson?? in the nineteen
thirties

<ICE-SIN:S2A-034#102:1:A>
And uh what he said was like I said the principle was that if you
relax your muscles then your whole mind will relax

<ICE-SIN:S2A-034#103:1:A>
Many people find that they cannot tell whether their muscles are
tense or relax lah

<ICE-SIN:S2A-034#104:1:A>
So what we did was have a series of exercises which focus uh on
tension that allow you to then you know

<ICE-SIN:S2A-034#105:1:A>
What it means when your muscles are tense and what that means when
your muscles are relaxed

<ICE-SIN:S2A-034#106:1:A>
So what I shall do is now I would like all of you to now just
tense your muscles really grip hard and tense everything clench you know
clench your your legs

<ICE-SIN:S2A-034#107:1:A>
And then your hands and bite as you know really hard really hard

<ICE-SIN:S2A-034#108:1:A>
And as you do that focus fully on your body focus on the tension
of your legs your arms your teeth and all that really tense tense tense tense

<ICE-SIN:S2A-034#109:1:A>
Now relax just relax and as you relax just focus on your muscles

<ICE-SIN:S2A-034#110:1:A>
How it feels when they are relaxed

<ICE-SIN:S2A-034#111:1:A>
So this one is very important because this is uh something you got
to learn about your body

<ICE-SIN:S2A-034#112:1:A>
How it feels ah to be tense and how it feels to be relaxed

<ICE-SIN:S2A-034#113:1:A>
What I shall do is to go through the whole series and what we'll
be doing is to tense and relax you know different muscle groups

<ICE-SIN:S2A-034#114:1:A>
As you tense and relax just focus on that part and don't tense or
relax the other parts

<ICE-SIN:S2A-034#115:1:A>
So if I say the feet ah just tense your feet and so on and so
don't just focus on that <X>

<ICE-SIN:S2A-034#X116:1:A>
And uh try to get a system because obviously this is something if
you want to use you've got to practice lah </X> </I>
