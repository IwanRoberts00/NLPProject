<ICE-SIN:S1B-058#2:1:A>
Amendment number seven Mr Ho

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-058#3:1:B>
Sir I beg that the sum allocated for Head R be reduced by ten
dollars in respect of Code R fifteen hundred of the main estimates

<ICE-SIN:S1B-058#4:1:B>
Sir the arts and culture in Singapore is undergoing a renaissance

<ICE-SIN:S1B-058#5:1:B>
There is a long awaited and welcomed breath of fresh air

<ICE-SIN:S1B-058#6:1:B>
The National Arts Council has in a short six months been catalytic
in in in initiating new activities and raising Singaporeans' awareness of the
arts to greater heights

<ICE-SIN:S1B-058#7:1:B>
All these augur well for Singapore for culture and the arts are
windows to the soul of a nation

<ICE-SIN:S1B-058#8:1:B>
They have a unifying effect a rallying call

<ICE-SIN:S1B-058#9:1:B>
When we speak of enhancing the quality of life of Singaporeans an
avowed aim of the Next Lap

<ICE-SIN:S1B-058#10:1:B>
a development of the culture and arts is a vital component activity

<ICE-SIN:S1B-058#11:1:B>
As a university don I've long recognised the abundant creative
talent in Singaporeans particularly our youths

<ICE-SIN:S1B-058#12:1:B>
I'm extremely pleased that this talent is increasingly becoming
evident having the space to flower and bloom

<ICE-SIN:S1B-058#13:1:B>
But Sir what does all these mean for the average Singaporean our Mr
or Miss HDB

<ICE-SIN:S1B-058#14:1:B>
I feel that it is important that appreciation and enjoyment of the
arts is not seen as a prerogative of the well-off or educated

<ICE-SIN:S1B-058#15:1:B>
It must not become a divide among Singaporeans as golf once used to
be

<ICE-SIN:S1B-058#16:1:B>
Arts and culture should unite us not divide us

<ICE-SIN:S1B-058#17:1:B>
I therefore like to ask the Minister what steps have been taken to
make enjoyment of the arts opened to all

<ICE-SIN:S1B-058#18:1:B>
Also wish to ask him three other questions

<ICE-SIN:S1B-058#19:1:B>
Firstly what is the Ministry's position on culture and artistic
offerings in the dialects

<ICE-SIN:S1B-058#20:1:B>
I think we read in the papers of a certain uh group wanting to hold
a large-scale international Cantonese opera in Singapore

<ICE-SIN:S1B-058#21:1:B>
and another and another group wanting to outdo the first group by
holding a subsequent one on an even larger scale

<ICE-SIN:S1B-058#22:1:B>
and a Teochew week has been held in Singapore

<ICE-SIN:S1B-058#23:1:B>
Think these will increase so that some guidelines will be helpful

<ICE-SIN:S1B-058#24:1:B>
A related question

<ICE-SIN:S1B-058#25:1:B>
what is the Ministry's position on the screening of dialect
programs on subscription TV in the future

<ICE-SIN:S1B-058#26:1:B>
Secondly what does the Minister see as future developments in the
cultural and arts scene

<ICE-SIN:S1B-058#27:1:B>
In particular what is the role of the National Arts Council

<ICE-SIN:S1B-058#28:1:B>
And thirdly in what ways can the business community professional
associations community groups and the people of Singapore in general give in
terms of greater support in arts and culture

<ICE-SIN:S1B-058#29:1:B>
Thank you Sir

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-058#30:1:A>
Question is that the sum to be allocated for head R be reduced
by ten dollars in respect of Code R fifteen hundred of the main estimates Mr
Choo

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-058#31:1:C>
Mr Chairman Sir in Mandarin

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-058#32:1:A>
Mr Ho

<$D> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-058#33:1:D>
Mr Chairman Sir let me first respond to the honourable member
for Sembawang GRC Mr Ho Peng Kee

<ICE-SIN:S1B-058#34:1:D>
But before I do that I wish to declare my interest

<ICE-SIN:S1B-058#35:1:D>
I am an amateur artist

<ICE-SIN:S1B-058#36:1:D>
As an artist I definitely welcome what uh has said by the
honourable member for Sembawang GRC as well as the honourable member for uh
Jalan Besar GRC

<ICE-SIN:S1B-058#37:1:D>
Sir with the economic success over the years we can now afford to
divert our attention and channel a bigger chunk of our resources in the
promotion of the arts

<ICE-SIN:S1B-058#38:1:D>
Sir in Singapore we are fortunate to be heirs to fine traditions
from both the east and the west

<ICE-SIN:S1B-058#39:1:D>
These uh shape and enrich our culture and social life

<ICE-SIN:S1B-058#40:1:D>
Sir our multi-cultural heritage provides a good foundation for a
Singapore identity

<ICE-SIN:S1B-058#41:1:D>
Of course it will take time by many who are familiar with the local
art scene

<ICE-SIN:S1B-058#42:1:D>
The evolution of such an identity is well underway

<ICE-SIN:S1B-058#43:1:D>
Third with the formation of the National Arts Council under the
able chairmanship of Professor Tommy Koh in September last year the promotion
of artists given a fresh momentum

<ICE-SIN:S1B-058#44:1:D>
We can expect a more active art scene in the years to come

<ICE-SIN:S1B-058#45:1:D>
However the National Art Council or NCA in short alone is not
enough

<ICE-SIN:S1B-058#46:1:D>
The private sector and the arts community must also come forward to
form a tripartite partnership in developing Singapore into a culturally
vibrant city

<ICE-SIN:S1B-058#47:1:D>
Sir the member also asked about the work of NAC uh

<ICE-SIN:S1B-058#48:1:D>
Let me briefly answer him

<ICE-SIN:S1B-058#49:1:D>
Sir since uh its inception in last September the NAC has
successfully completed a few major projects such as the traditional theatre
festival and the Singapore Dance festival

<ICE-SIN:S1B-058#50:1:D>
Sir the NAC has recently signed an agreement with the Scottish arts
council and the regional council to promote cultural exchanges between
Scotland and Singapore

<ICE-SIN:S1B-058#51:1:D>
Singapore artists and art administrators will have a chance to
visit and other Scottish cities for training and study tours

<ICE-SIN:S1B-058#52:1:D>
This is in line with NAC's objective of linking with the
international art community to cultural exchanges program with city noted for
the arts

<ICE-SIN:S1B-058#53:1:D>
Sir let me now list some of the programs and activities that AC
will implement over the next twelve months

<ICE-SIN:S1B-058#54:1:D>
Festival of Arts to be held in June this year Singapore Art Fair in
August also this year Cultural training with the Hong Kong Arts Festival

<ICE-SIN:S1B-058#55:1:D>
The establishment of an Art Endowment Fund new arts award schemes

<ICE-SIN:S1B-058#56:1:D>
Sir the NAC will also step up its effort to widen the audience
space as mentioned by the honourable just now

<ICE-SIN:S1B-058#57:1:D>
It will work with schools to promote interest in the arts among
students

<ICE-SIN:S1B-058#58:1:D>
And with mass organizations such as NTUC People's Association and
the Federation of Planned Association so that the general public will have a
greater access to art activities

<ICE-SIN:S1B-058#59:1:D>
We hope that with mass participation we will have a better chance
of success in realizing our vision for nineteen ninety nine

<ICE-SIN:S1B-058#60:1:D>
As to the specific uh reference raised by the honourable member

<ICE-SIN:S1B-058#61:1:D>
Sir MITA will give uh equal treatment to all art groups and
organizations

<ICE-SIN:S1B-058#62:1:D>
And we provide necessary assistance to them whenever it's required

<ICE-SIN:S1B-058#63:1:D>
So if one of the group wants to call an international uh Cantonese
opera and yet another group wants to hold another one

<ICE-SIN:S1B-058#64:1:D>
We'll we try our best to tell them its' to the best of their
interest to com combine or just have a a grand one because uh our audience
space is not big enough

<ICE-SIN:S1B-058#65:1:D>
and if they go on with their projects well good luck to them

<ICE-SIN:S1B-058#66:1:D>
Of course as far as MITA is concerned we'll like to give them
whatever is needed

<ICE-SIN:S1B-058#67:1:D>
As for the screen of uh dialect program on on TV I suppose I think
it's the policy of the government that the dialects program uh should not be
screened over TV because uh it would jeopardize the effort made by the Speak
Mandarin Campaign over the years

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-058#68:1:A>
Mr Ho we're running out of time We still have some amendments

<$D> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-058#69:1:D>
Yes give me just uh one two minutes to uh reply

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-058#70:1:A>
I give you one minute

<$D> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-058#71:1:D>
Well well uh let me now turn to the honourable member from
Jalan Jalan Besar GRC

<ICE-SIN:S1B-058#72:1:D>
Well uh let me first tell the member that in the business called
promotional the arts

<ICE-SIN:S1B-058#73:1:D>
Even if you have done a lot there is still a lot to be done

<ICE-SIN:S1B-058#74:1:D>
But I can assure the members that as well as the House that with
the formation of the National Arts Council greater emphasis will be given to
assist local artists and art groups including the promotion overseas

<ICE-SIN:S1B-058#75:1:D>
As regard the proposal by Mr Choo to set up a cultural uh village
uh I think it's a good idea

<ICE-SIN:S1B-058#76:1:D>
I will ask my officer to look into the feasibility of such a
proposal

<ICE-SIN:S1B-058#77:1:D>
Thank you

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-058#78:1:A>
Mr Ho

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-058#79:1:B>
Sir I thank the Senior for his comprehensive relpy and beg
leave to withdraw the motion

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-058#80:1:A>
Member given leave to withdraw his amendment Amendments
withdrawn Amendment number eight

<ICE-SIN:S1B-058#81:1:A>
We have ten minutes left

<ICE-SIN:S1B-058#82:1:A>
I will call on the Minister to reply

<ICE-SIN:S1B-058#83:1:A>
Two O Five Mr Ho

<$D> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-058#84:1:D>
No Sir

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-058#85:1:A>
Mr Teo

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-058#86:1:A>
Number five Incik Zulkifli

<$E> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-058#87:1:E>
Sir I beg to move that the sum to be allocated for Head S be
reduced by ten dollars in respect of Code S G fifteen hundred of the main
estimates

<ICE-SIN:S1B-058#88:1:E>
Sir under the existing Workmen Compensation Act manual workers are
covered by the Act regardless of their earnings

<ICE-SIN:S1B-058#89:1:E>
However non-manual workers are covered only if they earn less than
one thousand two hundred and fifty dollars per month

<ICE-SIN:S1B-058#90:1:E>
This income ceiling for non-manual workers was last adjusted in
nineteen eighty from seven hundred and fifty dollars to the present level of
one two five zero

<ICE-SIN:S1B-058#91:1:E>
Sir nineteen ninety one report published by NPB on productivity and
wage growth differentials showed that the wage growth between nineteen eighty
one to nineteen ninety averages out to around six point six percent

<ICE-SIN:S1B-058#92:1:E>
Thus it has been twelve years now since the income ceiling for
non-manual workers was last revised

<ICE-SIN:S1B-058#93:1:E>
In my opinion Sir there are sufficient grounds for the Ministry of
Labour to review this ceiling

<ICE-SIN:S1B-058#94:1:E>
I would like to suggest that the ceiling be raised but would like
to hear the Minister's view on this matter

<ICE-SIN:S1B-058#95:1:E>
Secondly Sir I would like to touch on clause three b of the third
schedule of the Workmen's Compensation Act

<ICE-SIN:S1B-058#96:1:E>
Of late there appears to be some ambiguity in its interpretation as
was evidenced by the much publicised Workmen's Compensation case involving a
worker and the management of SBS which was heard before the Commissioner over
the quantum of compensation to be awarded to the injured worker

<ICE-SIN:S1B-058#97:1:E>
Although the matter was finally settled through a compromise a lot
of unpleasantness and distrust has been generated

<ICE-SIN:S1B-058#98:1:E>
On the one hand the worker and his union contend that the
management in quibbling over the quantum to be award awarded

<ICE-SIN:S1B-058#99:1:E>
On the other hand the management believed he did the right thing by
raising a fundamental question in wanting to know how the quantum was arrived
at

<ICE-SIN:S1B-058#100:1:E>
Apparently the ambiguity ambiguity lies in the interpretation of
as to what constitutes compensation payable in the case of permanent total
incapacity as is proportionate to the loss of earning capacity

<ICE-SIN:S1B-058#101:1:E>
In the light of this case I would like to urge the Ministry of
Labour to review the same clause and make the necessary amendment so that its
provision could be interpreted more clearly to avoid such a dispute from
recurring individual

<ICE-SIN:S1B-058#102:1:E>
Sir I beg to move

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-058#103:1:A>
Question is that the sum to be allocated for Head S be
reduced by ten dollars in respect of Code S G fifteen hundred of the main
estimates

<ICE-SIN:S1B-058#104:1:A>
Dr Chen

<$F> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-058#105:1:F>
Mr Chairman Sir recently a union member suffered an injury
while's at work and was given a total of fifteen days of outpatient medical
leave and forty three days of hospitalization leave

<ICE-SIN:S1B-058#106:1:F>
His employer under the Ministry's advice paid him his full salary
for his hospitalization leave but only two third for his of his salary for
the outpatient leave

<ICE-SIN:S1B-058#107:1:F>
The Ministry's position appears to be based on clause four of the
third schedule of the Workmen's Compensation Act which provides that the
workmen suffering from temporary incap incapacity due to injuries at work is
entitled to full wages for a period of sixty days if he's hospitalized

<ICE-SIN:S1B-058#108:1:F>
and fourteen days if he is not hospitalized

<ICE-SIN:S1B-058#109:1:F>
and thereafter to a payment every month of an amount equal to two
thirds of his monthly earnings during the incapci incapacity or during a
period of one year whichever period is shorter

<ICE-SIN:S1B-058#110:1:F>
It appears to me that the Ministry is treating the full salary
entitlement under hospitalization leave

<ICE-SIN:S1B-058#111:1:F>
and that under outpatient leave as an either-or situation

<ICE-SIN:S1B-058#112:1:F>
That is if a worker has been hospitalized then he would only be
paid full wages for his hospital leave and not his outpatient leave

<ICE-SIN:S1B-058#113:1:F>
Sir I think this interpretation of the law is illogical and
erroneous

<ICE-SIN:S1B-058#114:1:F>
The irony is that if the worker had just claimed for medical leave
under the Employment Act he would have been paid full salary

<ICE-SIN:S1B-058#115:1:F>
It is therefore unfair that the worker who is injured because of
an accident at work should be placed at a disadvantage compared to a worker
who takes ordinary sick leave <X>

<ICE-SIN:S1B-058#X116:1:F>
I'm of the view that the word 'and' appearing in the clause four
gives an injured employee the right to claim full wages for both
hospitalization and outpatient leave in respect of the same injury subject to
the maximum num number of days stipulated Sir if this is merely a problem of
interpretation I hope the Ministry would put it right But if the Ministry
thinks that its interpretation is correct then the law should be amended to
make it in line with the Employment Act provisions May I have the Minister's
view on this Thank you Sir Mr Speaker: Dr Ong Chit Chung: Mr Chairman Sir
first I would uh take up the point raised by Mr Zulkifli The Workmen
Compensation Act now covers seventy three percent of the total workforce
based on the labour force survey of nineteen ninety one It was last uh
revised as far as Workmen Compensation uh was concerned in nineteen eighty
one It is now about ten years and definitely it's time to review I'll like to
thank the member for bringing this point up The Ministry is actively
reviewing the quantum but we have to bear a number of factors in mind for
example the impact in terms of cost on employers as they have to buy uh
larger coverage in terms of insurance But with inflation and rising cost for
our workers and uh we have also to take care of the interest of our workers
and therefore we must revise the ceiling upwards The question is how much and
we are working on it Uh we will consult the NTUC and we thank the NTUC uh
members for bringing this up With reference to the uh case uh brought up by
Mr Zulkifli about the SBS case I would like to say that the under the Workmen
Compensation Act compensation for permanent incapacity takes into account the
loss of earning capacity for every type of employment which the an injured
worker was able to undertake at the time of the accident Therefore although
the injured worker continued to be employed in this case by SBS the
compensation awarded for permanent incapacity is meant to take into account
the likely loss of earnings which the worker will face if he were to take up
any other employment It was on this basis that the injured worker in the SBS
case was awarded compensation of twenty four thousand six hundred Uh the
Ministry view is that there is no ambiguity in terms of law and we will
ensure that workers are given full protection under the Workmen Compensation
Act In this particular case the uh parties concerned came to a settlement
amongst themselves But if you go by precedent the Commissioner is likely to
uh rule in favour of the worker I would like to thank uh Dr John Chen for
bringing up this very important case of the uh SMRT I will not uh uh disagree
with him I think he has got it correct The Ministry has review its practice
on making a rigid or fine distinction between hospitalization and outpatient
medical leave Where there is no evidence of malingering or abuse the Workmen
Compensation Department I will assure Dr Chen will advise employers to treat
such outpatient leave as full pay leave up to a maximum of fourteen days I
will like to thank him again for bringing this up on behalf of all the
workers Mr Speaker: Inche Zulkifli Mr Zulkifli: Sir although I'm not quite
happy on the answer given on the SBS case but nevertheless I withdraw my
amendment </X> </I>
