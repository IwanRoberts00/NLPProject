<I>

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#1:1:A>
Uh and I find that they are well-organised

<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#2:1:A>
Ya

<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#3:1:A>
What they do right from beginning uh source out speakers

<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#4:1:A>
Okay they get speakers

<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#5:1:A>
They would have a provisional list uh

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#6:1:B>
Ya

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#7:1:A>
Uh and then quickly have an initial initial promotion and see
what is the uh response first

<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#8:1:A>
That's very professional

<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#9:1:A>
Have response and then second round more detailed

<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#10:1:A>
It's like uh gradually building up you know

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#11:1:B>
Ya

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#12:1:A>
Even the pamphlets

<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#13:1:A>
They'll say not just who should attend but give elaborate uh the
the content of the

<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#14:1:A>
Makes a lot of difference

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#15:1:B>
That's right

<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#16:1:B>
I do not know what happened because when I first spoke to student
<unclear> word </unclear> I checked with them a few things

<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#17:1:B>
I thought that chances of success will be very high you know

<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#18:1:B>
But I don't know what happened on the last two months

<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#19:1:B>
Suddenly the thing becomes so quiet

<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#20:1:B>
That's why I got worried

<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#21:1:B>
About months ago I thought this thing's off

<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#22:1:B>
I called up and uh Rosrena told me that she'll be resigning

<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#23:1:B>
So I think the the whole thing got quiet off you know

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#24:1:A>
Obviously

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#25:1:B>
And I I think she didn't tell the her employer until two weeks
ago

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#26:1:A>
I see

<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#27:1:A>
That's very bad

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#28:1:B>
Ya

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#29:1:A>
Obviously she could have been because she's leaving right

<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#30:1:A>
She could have been just leaving this matter

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#31:1:B>
To another person

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#32:1:A>
Ya

<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#33:1:A>
Or just not do anything

<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#34:1:A>
So that these people would take

<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#35:1:A>
I I must say that these two girls uh uh they brave the
embarrassment

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#36:1:B>
That's why <unclear> word </unclear>

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#37:1:A>
Because if I'm the organizer I'll be terribly embarrassed

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#38:1:B>
In fact <unclear> word </unclear> called it off lah

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#39:1:A>
Huh

<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#40:1:A>
Probably they should

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#41:1:B>
Because they're not going to make a profit uh

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#42:1:A>
Now for me I don't mind lah but used to used to writing papers

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#43:1:B>
That's why

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#44:1:A>
I'll have to uh the the lady who helped me with the one of my
team members who helped me with the some transparencies

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#45:1:B>
Uhm uhm

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#46:1:A>
It's a very uh that's that's for our own use lah

<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#47:1:A>
That's okay

<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#48:1:A>
But the survey uh we we extract the findings from this uh

<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#49:1:A>
But the one who did the transparencies uh I must she brought the
second paper here

<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#50:1:A>
She must have seen the

<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#51:1:A>
I must go back and tell her that 'A' never mind

<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#52:1:A>
She expected to have a lot of people see her transparencies

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#53:1:B>
But anyway I my feeling is that any effort that that need to
be put in should be put in the best way huh

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#54:1:A>
Ya

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#55:1:B>
Because I think this would still be useful like you say you
know

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#56:1:A>
Ya

<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#57:1:A>
Uh last year I was uh at this uh similar SYBEX

<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#58:1:A>
There was a conference uhm I think what could have made a
difference was that that one uh the conference itself the CIDB was a problem

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#59:1:B>
Uhm uhm uhm that's why

<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#60:1:B>
But it seems that CIDB and <unclear> word </unclear> are going off
because of the that conference

<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#61:1:B>
That's why you know they're having problem you see

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#62:1:A>
Oh

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#63:1:B>
It seems that their division of profit was not fairly done or
whatever you know

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#64:1:A>
I see

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#65:1:B>
So uhm that's why CIDB not only uhm refuse to <unclear> word
</unclear>

<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#66:1:B>
They also refuse to send any person and give any papers

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#67:1:A>
No wonder

<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#68:1:A>
'Cos they have very good contacts <unclear> word </unclear>

<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#69:1:A>
And the distribution system they just send to every developer every
contractor

<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#70:1:A>
Last year the response was very good

<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#71:1:A>
But I remembered it was CIDB mainly

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#72:1:B>
But I say you know it should not be a problem to get a hundred
people for this type of <unclear> word </unclear> you see

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#73:1:A>
Shouldn't be a problem

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#74:1:B>
Like I'll say it's basically a careless uh you know you know
very careless uh approach

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#75:1:A>
Ya I saw the advert on the exhibition

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#76:1:B>
Uhm

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#77:1:A>
Nothing on the conference

<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#78:1:A>
I said Well maybe they have enough people

<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#79:1:A>
That's why

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#80:1:B>
Now I don't know how their Hong Kong and the Thailand they
have ever heard of program Symex <unclear> word </unclear>

<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#81:1:B>
But of course that's as you've noticed they're not very experienced
what the the people running the show huh

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#82:1:A>
Ya

<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#83:1:A>
Ya I received a note

<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#84:1:A>
Uh please introduce introduce yourself

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#85:1:B>
Ya

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#86:1:A>
And do everything yourself

<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#87:1:A>
Your research has been mainly for government departments uh

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#88:1:B>
Uhm So far yes

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#89:1:A>
But formerly you used to do some for private

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#90:1:B>
Ya

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#91:1:A>
Development right

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#92:1:B>
I do quite a bit then but recently

<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#93:1:B>
I don't know why

<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#94:1:B>
Inunisation <unclear> word </unclear> is it

<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#95:1:B>
Partings of firms

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#96:1:B>
Ya

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#97:1:A>
But the uh the guv the uh private side uh the investment level
has gone down

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#98:1:B>
Ya

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#99:1:A>
Because there are so many buildings coming up you see

<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#100:1:A>
Apart from building uh private property

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#101:1:B>
Uhm

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#102:1:A>
uh people are not building commercial

<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#103:1:A>
There's just too much coming up uh

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#104:1:B>
Ya

<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#105:1:B>
Do you see a trend uh downward movement for residential

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#106:1:A>
Uh well we thought that and I thought that it will it'll go
down

<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#107:1:A>
it didn't go down

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#108:1:B>
Ya it seems strong uh

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#109:1:A>
Ya I think

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#110:1:B>
Surprisingly

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#111:1:A>
I think uh what we did not expect was that the uh we had to
go by supply demand plus uh the confidence factor which is related to the
economic performance

<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#112:1:A>
And uh we had to go by what the government was projecting that is
that there was there will be a bit of slowdown but that slowdown didn't
happen

<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#113:1:A>
I think that is <unclear> word </unclear> because towards end of
last year October onwards uh the market was very quiet

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#114:1:B>
Uhm

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#115:1:A>
And uh we we knew that the developers were giving uh very
good discounts twenty percent which means definitely there was dropping
already

<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#116:1:A>
If it carried on uh to January February it would drop you see

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#117:1:B>
Uhm

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#118:1:A>
But uh what happened was the projected drop by one percent of
the GNP did not happen because it was supposed to be the earlier uh expected
growth rate of say five percent was revised even downwards you know

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#119:1:B>
Uhm uhm

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#120:1:A>
Uh but what what is apparent now the last the first three
months of the year uh we might have achieved more than the original even five
percent you know

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#121:1:B>
Ya

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#122:1:A>
So because of that so although the market is quiet people
felt uh I mean everybody is still

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#123:1:B>
Ya

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#124:1:A>
Is still very well-to-do right

<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#125:1:A>
Better start buying

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#126:1:B>
But I think this slowdown is not that it didn't happen

<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#127:1:B>
I think this slowdown is delayed you know

<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#128:1:B>
Huh

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#129:1:A>
Is delayed

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#130:1:B>
Ya

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#131:1:A>
But the question is how long the delay <unclear> word
</unclear>

<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#132:1:A>
My my own feeling is that because of the sudden boost in
confidence uh

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#133:1:B>
Uhm

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#134:1:A>
uh people who would have uh been willing to wait uh is
probably not uh sorry not going to wait too long

<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#135:1:A>
So the level of demand would be a bit higher

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#136:1:B>
To pick up

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#137:1:A>
ya so that uh instead of stabilising and then drops slightly
uh it might actually continue to keep up and then level off

<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#138:1:A>
Instead of instead of level and down it would be up and level

<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#139:1:A>
You see the complexion is different

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#140:1:B>
Uhm uhm uhm

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#141:1:A>
And uh what I did was uh the other day when the report came
up uh

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#142:1:B>
Uhm

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#143:1:A>
I was surprised also what

<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#144:1:A>
I didn't I thought it would stabilise

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#145:1:B>
Uhm

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#146:1:A>
But not you know

<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#147:1:A>
Uh only when the economic results came out then but what we did
was to go back look at the figures again

<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#148:1:A>
And I think that the the level of demand we may have
underestimated cos' we're basing on historical figures and give a certain uh
what we would expect to be a normal increase say instead of three thousand
three thousand five

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#149:1:B>
Uhm

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#150:1:A>
apartments uh

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#151:1:B>
Uhm uhm

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#152:1:A>
and condominiums uh demanded every year we give a certain
increase of maybe ten twenty percent

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#153:1:B>
Uhm uhm

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#154:1:A>
to allow for income group and that will give maybe about
close to four thousand as against uh expected supply of five thousand or more

<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#155:1:A>
That obviously would be a serious over-supply but looks like the
demand may we may have to revise it to say four four four five you know

<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#156:1:A>
Looking at the past three months uh

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#157:1:B>
Ya

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#158:1:A>
So if you look at four five as against the supply of five
thousand it's slightly above five thousand

<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#159:1:A>
The over-supply is not not sufficient to bring price down

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#160:1:B>
Do you think there'll be a I think uh after this report the
level will even go higher

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#161:1:A>
Uh huh that's one reason

<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#162:1:A>
The other factor is that the the other day although uh it was not
splashed uh but it was announced the CPF interest rates uh would be reduced
to below three percent or below four percent is it

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#163:1:B>
Below four

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#164:1:A>
Currently it's four plus

<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#165:1:A>
It'll be reduced to three point nine or something like that

<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#166:1:A>
That has a big effect you know

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#167:1:B>
Yes yes ya

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#168:1:A>
Because from people's point of view why should I still leave
money inside

<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#169:1:A>
It's just not earning enough return

<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#170:1:A>
And even if the property market should go down and later come up
again never mind just put in first

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#171:1:B>
That's why

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#172:1:A>
Ya I think it will have an effect

<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#173:1:A>
They're actually encouraging more property investment

<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#174:1:A>
I think so

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#175:1:B>
Ya because that will be a major factor because it's miserable

<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#176:1:B>
You're talking about three plus uh

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#177:1:A>
Cos' three plus is like <O> sighs </O>

<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#178:1:A>
Just <unclear> word </unclear> probably covering inflation also

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#179:1:B>
No growth you know

<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#180:1:B>
Consider it's a fixed deposit for twenty years uh

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#181:1:A>
Ya

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#182:1:B>
It's uh it's crazy you know

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#183:1:A>
No growth ya

<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#184:1:A>
'Cos any rational person

<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#185:1:A>
If I if I have money and I have a if I can afford lah if can't
afford can't be helped

<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#186:1:A>
If I can afford and I can take out the money I will because while
we talk about possible slowdown uh

<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#187:1:A>
But uh in the longer term we know it's going up also once that uh
over-supply is going to be taken up

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#188:1:B>
That's why

<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#189:1:B>
But I still think that this slowdown will come lah

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#190:1:A>
It will

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#191:1:B>
It will lah

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#192:1:A>
It will of course the question is the effect

<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#193:1:A>
What is the effect

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#194:1:B>
Perhaps now it sort of smooth over you know

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#195:1:A>
Ya <unclear> word </unclear>

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#196:1:B>
rather than have a sharp

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#197:1:A>
Instead of like that uh it'll just bends a little bit

<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#198:1:A>
The other side is really quite near if you look at you can just
swim across

<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#199:1:A>
I think the idea of having this is nice but somehow as you're
saying that the elements are not related at all

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#200:1:B>
That's why

<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#201:1:B>
And also I think it's too harsh

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#202:1:A>
Ya too hard

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#203:1:B>
Too hard uh

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#204:1:A>
So many concrete patches

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#205:1:B>
Ya

<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#206:1:B>
As our environment <unclear> word </unclear> goal we should have
sort of some landscape and a few uh fountain you know uh like that uh

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#207:1:A>
That's right that's right

<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#208:1:A>
Be willing to spend uh

<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#209:1:A>
They always talk about cost cost cost

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#210:1:B>
The problem is that they frequently want to spend but stop
short

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#211:1:A>
Ya

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#212:1:B>
That's as a result of which uh we don't have hundred percent

<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#213:1:B>
We don't have distinction

<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#214:1:B>
We always As or Bs

<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#215:1:B>
That's a problem you know

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#216:1:A>
Ya

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#217:1:B>
But uh but uh <unclear> word </unclear> of the other side the
terminal is also very hard you know

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#218:1:A>
Ya it is hard

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#219:1:B>
Ya I find that I find that it's

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#220:1:A>
If you walk around looks nice but you you don't feel very
cosy

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#221:1:B>
Uhm ya that's right

<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#222:1:B>
The problem is that I think we we always look at other other
system Australia elsewhere and try to try to sort of emulate you know uh

<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#223:1:B>
But fail badly because we don't uh don't sort of modify to suit
our own condition

<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#224:1:B>
But in in in acoustic well it's the same thing and I think
there're a lot of other things you know

<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#225:1:B>
Uhm we don't seem to have uh mature from there although I suppose
this will come

<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#226:1:B>
Takes some time

<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#227:1:B>
But right now I think uh still the the flight <unclear> word
</unclear> is not right

<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#228:1:B>
But I I'm won I'm wondering uh whether this this thing will be
will happen because we seem to have reached our sort of prime you know prime
nation moving into an economic development you know <X>

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#X229:1:A>
I think so ya I think so

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#X230:1:B>
Yes <unclear> word </unclear>

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#X231:1:A>
and we'll not we'll not the growth hub

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#X232:1:B>
That's right And if you're not cashing in on this uh you may
grow old very quickly

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#X233:1:A>
I think so ya

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#X234:1:B>
Uhm

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#X235:1:A>
Ya

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#X236:1:B>
A <unclear> word </unclear> development

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#X237:1:A>
That's why I was

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#X238:1:B>
And I think it's now the the other nation that can learn
from our past

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#X239:1:A>
Ya

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#X240:1:B>
and and and all that That's why yesterday Sarawak this chap
was telling that you know they're very keen to understand our system and see
how we work because there're things that they can learn you know like
conservation

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#X241:1:A>
Ya

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#X242:1:B>
Now they can look into their own conservation problem and
they can plan a conservation strategy

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#X243:1:A>
Ya

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#X244:1:B>
you know based on our lesson

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#X245:1:A>
Ya lah ya that's right right Oh ya I I have been giving
couple of data and uh

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#X246:1:B>
That's why I said I have been

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#X247:1:A>
KL KL also

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#X248:1:B>
That's why

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#X249:1:A>
They are very keen and

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#X250:1:B>
Ya

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#X251:1:A>
in fact they have a lot of good buildings

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#X252:1:B>
That's why

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#X253:1:A>
that are not torn down unlike us we were going at a very hot
pace Penang also In fact uh just before this our KL office called 'Can you
help in this uh just giving some info lah on conservation Uh how they should
do it in Penang you know I said no we're writing a paper for this Send you a
paper lah

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-029#X254:1:B>
Uhm ya </X> </I>
