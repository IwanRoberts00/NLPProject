<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-012#61:1:B>
How long has she been there

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-012#62:1:C>
Oh that's not

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-012#63:1:B>
She's from

<ICE-SIN:S1A-012#64:1:C>

People can buy ya go and from buy her out from you know like
Cambridge that kind of thing quite easy to bring her out

<ICE-SIN:S1A-012#66:1:A>
Ya ya so she's trying to write to Straits Times

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-012#67:1:C>
But then that would mean being stuck in Straits Times for six
years right

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-012#68:1:A>
Uhm

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-012#69:1:B>

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-012#72:1:C>
But if she really wants to leave she should but she should
give herself a year or two to really decide you know

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-012#73:1:B>
Can she tahan a year or two

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-012#74:1:C>
That or try another school

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-012#75:1:A>
No but she was never cut out for teaching lah anyway

<ICE-SIN:S1A-012#76:1:A>
But she doesn't mind teaching you know it's all the

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-012#77:1:C>
That's what all teachers say uh

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-012#78:1:A>

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-012#81:1:B>
Students as well

<$D> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-012#82:1:D>
So there's nothing much lah is there

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-012#83:1:A>
Why work for admin

<$D> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-012#84:1:D>
So are you looking around as well

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-012#85:1:B>
They're getting aiyah it's boring lah

<ICE-SIN:S1A-012#86:1:B>
You know I mean they're just <unclear> word </unclear>

<ICE-SIN:S1A-012#87:1:B>
So this year I got very boring boring boring boring

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-012#88:1:C>
You're teaching first year is it this year

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-012#89:1:B>
Second year

<ICE-SIN:S1A-012#90:1:B>
One class is very good I mean they're very interested in everything
but in other classes like they can't be bothered you know

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-012#91:1:C>
Ha

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-012#92:1:B>
Like aiyah why are we here in the first place

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-012#93:1:C>
You mean that bad uh

<ICE-SIN:S1A-012#94:1:C>
I thought your your students will be more motivated than the
students from RJC

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-012#95:1:B>
Not really you know

<$D> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-012#96:1:D>
Why would they

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-012#97:1:B>
I think about fifty percent are not not not interested

<ICE-SIN:S1A-012#98:1:B>
Just going through the motion

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-012#99:1:A>
Do they see beyond 'A' level

<ICE-SIN:S1A-012#100:1:A>
I mean what do they see beyond 'A' level

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-012#101:1:B>
University which they can't get into

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-012#102:1:A>
Ya lah be realistic

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-012#103:1:B>
They may be very good at <unclear> word </unclear>

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-012#104:1:A>
'A' level is such a useless

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-012#105:1:B>
place isn't it

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-012#106:1:A>
Ya unless you can make it to the U you know

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-012#107:1:B>
Even <unclear> word </unclear>

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-012#108:1:C>
But then what about education for its own sake uh

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-012#109:1:A>
Not at 'A' level

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-012#110:1:C>
Why not

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-012#111:1:A>
not when they cram everything in two years

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-012#112:1:B>
Uhm

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-012#113:1:A>
and you study from seven thirty to five

<$D> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-012#114:1:D>
What do you get out of it

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-012#115:1:A>
Ya

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-012#116:1:B>
Because and then you talk about anything they don't sound

<ICE-SIN:S1A-012#117:1:B>
They're not interested in anything you know I mean like

<$D> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-012#118:1:D>
The only thing I ever enjoyed was GP

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-012#119:1:C>
Because I got something out of it

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-012#120:1:B>
<unclear> word </unclear>

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-012#121:1:C>
Maybe now that I'm leaving uh <unclear> word </unclear> like
less harsh on

<ICE-SIN:S1A-012#122:1:C>
I know my perception on the students <unclear> word </unclear>
become less <unclear> word </unclear>

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-012#123:1:B>
But I like I like my last my students last time you know the
two first two batches I had

<ICE-SIN:S1A-012#124:1:B>
You brought up anything and discussed they're very interested

<ICE-SIN:S1A-012#125:1:B>
You know what I mean 'cos it's something interesting

<$D> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-012#126:1:D>
You mean you got to work extra hard to make them interested
now

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-012#127:1:B>
ya but I'm so tired

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-012#128:1:C>
Ya I think it's it's got to do with the system

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-012#129:1:B>
<unclear> word </unclear> also you know

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-012#130:1:C>
I don't think the students would have changed that that much

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-012#131:1:B>
No they're they're definitely different

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-012#132:1:C>
Ya

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-012#133:1:A>
I mean they're different now in maybe you just <unclear> word
</unclear> and put in their marks

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-012#134:1:B>
Uhm

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-012#135:1:A>
Except

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-012#136:1:B>
Uhm because partly you see there there's commerce classes and
science classes and arts classes

<ICE-SIN:S1A-012#137:1:B>
Usually in arts classes they are more talkative

<ICE-SIN:S1A-012#138:1:B>
Science classes also the boys they don't care

<ICE-SIN:S1A-012#139:1:B>
Anyway you just say anything and it'll be very funny they don't
mind

<ICE-SIN:S1A-012#140:1:B>
But for the uhm

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-012#141:1:A>
Commerce

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-012#142:1:B>
For the commerce

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-012#143:1:A>
It tells

<ICE-SIN:S1A-012#144:1:A>
You mean you are shy

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-012#145:1:C>
Ya actually uh

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-012#146:1:B>
But mean lah

<ICE-SIN:S1A-012#147:1:B>
Actually it's mean lah all my sins before stumble <unclear> word
</unclear> and then stare

<$D> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-012#148:1:D>

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-012#149:1:C>

But he will gain marketing experience soon and then they can
employ him okay

<ICE-SIN:S1A-012#253:1:C>

to jeopardize his future
