Q1 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-016#2:1>
Clausewitz is considered
by many as one of the foremost European military strategist.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-016#3:1>
His contributions to warfare, though criticized by some
writers, in my opinion has given a profound impact to modern strategic
thinking. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-016#4:1>
This essay will closely examine the major
contributions made by Clausewitz in the study of warfare and at the same time
showing why his reputation is based on firm foundation. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-016#5:1>
Clausewitz considered war more of an art than science. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-016#6:1>
It was creative and not imitative. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-016#7:1>
Hence, warfare which
was constantly undergoing changes had to accommodate to the changing
situations and adapt according to the circumstances. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-016#8:1>
Flexibility in warfare was advocated, and relevantly so by Clausewitz.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-016#9:1>
Clausewitz said that war should serve the political
purpose for which it is being waged. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-016#10:1>
hence drew a
symbiotic relationship between strategy and statecraft.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-016#11:1>
The political purpose for which the war is the means,
and there cannot be an end by itself. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-016#12:1>
Hence, war
should serve the political purpose for which it is being waged.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-016#13:1>
Clausewitz put this very clearly when he said " War
has got its own language ( grammar) but not its own logic." I tend to agree
with Clausewitz view as it is true that wars ( generally) are being waged
with a political purpose. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-016#14:1>
Although in the third world
countries we see the military ( war) at times replacing the political
purpose, it cannot be said that Clausewitz theory falls short of what he
claims. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-016#15:1>
Looking at the recent Gulf crisis gives a very
good example of the military serving the government ( political purpose.) The
political purpose was to see the Iraqi troops being forced out of Kuwait, and
once that purpose was met a ceasefire was called and negotiations for a
peaceful settlement has started. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-016#16:1>
Cluasewitz clearly
defines the role of the political leaders. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-016#17:1>
Here
Clausewitz draws the hallmark of his thought - the trinity of the government,
the military and the people. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-016#18:1>
While the government
provides the political purpose, the military provides the means for achieving
the political purpose and the people the will - the enigma of determination.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-016#19:1>
This for Clausewitz is his indispensable foundation of
his theory. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-016#20:1>
Clausewitz clearly spells out the role of
the political leaders. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-016#21:1>
They are supposed to provide
the leadership and draw the political purpose for which a war is to be waged.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-016#22:1>
The military on its part, since the political leaders
provide the purpose, has to subordinate itself to the political will.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-016#23:1>
Hence, the military carrys out the purpose of the
political leaders. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-016#24:1>
For Clausewitz, war is a 'bloody
violence,' to its outmost. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-016#25:1>
It is an act of violence
aimed at compelling our opponents to do our will. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-016#26:1>
Because Clausewitz claimed that war should be waged to its outmost ( absolute
war) he came under severe criticism, especially from J.FC Fuller for the
violence in the 2nd world war. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-016#27:1>
However, one has to
understand what Clausewitz really meant. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-016#28:1>
What
Clausewitz meant was war in the 'abstract.' In reality, there were several
frictions in war ( fogs of war) such as terrain, weather morale and so forth
that constraint war being waged to its maximum. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-016#29:1>
If we
looked at the recent Gulf crisis, we can see Clausewitz's relevance where the
war being waged at it outmost with the allied bombing was constantly hindered
by 'frictions' especially the weather, hence resulting in the allied forces
cutting down their sorties. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-016#30:1>
For Clausewitz there are
not given 'set of rules' in war that qualifies as a strategy.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-016#31:1>
This is because firstly Clausewitz feels that war is
imperative. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-016#32:1>
Nobody would exactly know what the enemy
really is up to. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-016#33:1>
Also given the problems in gathering
correct information hinders forces from planning out a exact strategy.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-016#34:1>
Clausewitz instead advocates that one should rather
locate the enemy's 'centre of gravity' and concentrate in attacking the
centre of gravity which is the pivotal of the enemy's strength.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-016#35:1>
It could be its airbases, communication lines or given
its food granary. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-016#36:1>
It is true that each country has its
centre of gravity and a destruction of the centre of gravity could bring a
quick end to the war. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-016#37:1>
For example, India's centre of
gravity is its navy and the destruction of its navy would make its security
redundant. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-016#38:1>
Clausewitz advocates the defense strategy
to that of the offense. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-016#39:1>
This is because he feels that
it is easier to hold 'ground than to take new one.' However one should not
brush this as just a 'passive act.' Clausewitz defense is broken down into 2
stages. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-016#40:1>
Firstly, one waits for the attack, being well
prepared and then deal it with a swift counter offensive.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-016#41:1>
Having achieved this, it would a set the satge for the
forces to then proceed to the offense which would allow the forces to be in a
better position. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-016#42:1>
However, given the rapid advancement
in modern technology today, the would be some doubt our Clausewitz advocation
of the theory, as one country as got a effective defense system against
nuclear technology. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-016#43:1>
But if we adhere to Clausewitz
beleif that it si easier to 'hold ground' than acquire new one it does proven
relevant as one is more familiar with the terrain, condition and so on.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-016#44:1>
Clausewitz feels that numerical superiority in war
plays a important factor. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-016#45:1>
One should first be
numerically superior generally and then at decisive points.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-016#46:1>
For Clausewitz suprise is more of a tactic than a
strategy. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-016#47:1>
Clausewitz pays close attention to the human
factor - moral and will. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-016#48:1>
To him it is a inseparable
marriage with war. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-016#49:1>
Generally, all strategist have
given priority to the human factor where moral factors and human will plays a
crucial role in the outcome of battles. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-016#50:1>
In a final
analysis, I do not think that Clausewitz role has been blown out of
proportion. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-016#51:1>
What Clausewitz advocated in the
relationship between war and politics is generally what all states at present
adhere to. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-016#52:1>
For example, in the Korean war had
MacArthur ( the military) defied Truman ( the political purpose) which he
badly wanted to and staged a attack beyond the political purpose of 'containment'
one may be be able to imagine the devastating consequences, as it could have
triggered off a third world war, with the Soviet Union and CHina intervening.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-016#53:1>
Hence, the central tenet of Clausewitz theory of the
military being subordinate to the government can in a way be considered as a 'safeguard.'

<ICE-SIN:W1A-016#54:1>
Clausewitz role in my opinion has not been blown out
of proportion. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-016#55:1>
A clear understanding of his war in the 'abstract'
and war in reality, as explained in the essay, is needed. </I>

Q2 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-016#57:2>
B H Liddell Hart has
indeed correctly put the Sun Tzu has clearer vision, more profound insight
and eternal freshness. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-016#58:2>
No other testimony is a better
support to this statement than to say that what Sun Tzu had advocated
centuries ago, is till this present day still relevant and was closely
adhered by a present contemporary - Mao Tse Tung who following Sun Tzu's
maxims established a new regime in China in 1949. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-016#59:2>
As
the quotation suggest Sun Tzu's 'Art of War' is indeed comprehensive,
covering generally all aspects in staging a warfare and also is very simple
to understand. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-016#60:2>
It is indeed as Liddell Hart comments,
the 'essence on the conduct of war.' Sun Tzu is considered as the 'saint' in
ancient Chinese strategic thinking because of the 'profound insight' he was
able to show in the conduct of warfare, not only in ancient time but
correctly anticipating the changing evolution of warfare in time to come.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-016#61:2>
It is important to note that Sun Tzu never thought of
how to avoid war but rather how to conduct war. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-016#62:2>
War to
Sun Tzu is a recurring act which cannot be avoided, hence it was only useful
that one should study the conduct of warfare. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-016#63:2>
To Sun
Tzu the study of war was associated with victory and victory can be achieved
by using the correct strategy. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-016#64:2>
Sun Tzu was against
violence or brute force and to him it should only be used as a last resort.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-016#65:2>
Here, one must note that Sun Tzu was not advocating 'zero'
violence rather he talked of how violence could be kept to the minimum.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-016#66:2>
Sun Tzu's belief in minimum violence dates back to the
Confucian maxim which advocated the triumph of the wen ( literate culture)
over the wu ( warfare). 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-016#67:2>
A righteous leader should
never resort to violence to achieve his aims. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-016#68:2>
Furthermore Sun Tzu believed in a 'harmonious' society which would not be
condoned by violence. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-016#69:2>
At the strategic level Sun Tzu
also saw that if a city can be taken intact, its resources can be put to good
use by the victor. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-016#70:2>
No one can deny what Sun Tzu
advocated was relevant. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-016#71:2>
In our present society, no one
likes to see violence or cities being destroyed, and like Sun Tzu said
violence should be used as a last resort. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-016#72:2>
It is indeed
true that even people in our present day believe living in a 'harmonious'
soceity. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-016#73:2>
Sun Tzu advocated 4 levels of strategy in
achieving victory. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-016#74:2>
The best level was to attack the
enemy's plan and put him off balance. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-016#75:2>
In Confusion and
fear he will be forced to flee. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-016#76:2>
This was what Liddell
Hart was later to term as 'psychological dislocation.' The second best level
is to break the enemy's alliance. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-016#77:2>
This was then make
the enemy weak and easily susceptible, I tend to agree with the relevance of
this strategy by Sun Tzu. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-016#78:2>
In the latest warfare - the
Gulf crisis, Saddam Hussein knowing very well how formidable the alliance
was, attempted to break up the alliance by trying to drag Israel into the
war. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-016#79:2>
If this had happened quite surely the alliance
might have been broken. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-016#80:2>
Sun Tzu's third level of
strategy called for a direct attack on the enemy's forces which was to be
taken only if there was no other choice. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-016#81:2>
The worst
level of strategy was to attack cities. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-016#82:2>
Generally, we
notice that all contemporary warfare are waged on this 'levels of strategy.'
states do try to negotiate to keep violence to the minimum.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-016#83:2>
Even when war does break up a direct confrontation ro
attack on cities, is used as a last resort. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-016#84:2>
To achieve
the success of the strategy Sun Tzu gives a clear understanding on the
concept of deception. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-016#85:2>
To him all warfare is based on
deception.' Rightly so in warfare the 'art of deception' does stand out as
the 'lethal weapon.' In deception, Sun tells how one is to pretend and
conceal one own's strength and deceive the enemy into falling for your
deception. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-016#86:2>
He also cautions not in the event, be
deceived by the enemy. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-016#87:2>
Deception to him is the key to
achieving victory. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-016#88:2>
To achieve deception Sun Tzu talks
of 'foreknowledge' and the employment of secret agents who will carry out
this job of gathering information. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-016#89:2>
This indeed is true
even till this day. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-016#90:2>
For example in the Arab Israel;
war of 1967, the Israeli secret agent successfully got hold of the Arab War
Plans, thus were able to destroy the Arab Forces. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-016#91:2>
Even
in the second world war the allied forces deceived the Germans into believing
the amphibious attack would take place at Pas-De-Calais but instead
successfully landed at Normandy. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-016#92:2>
Sun Tzu believe that
whoever has the initiative in the battleground would be able to put the enemy 'like
a puppet in a string' does instead prove relevant. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-016#93:2>
The
Gulf crisis showed that right from the beginning, the allied forces were able
to take the initiative and dictate the pace in the war.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-016#94:2>
As correctly said by Sun Tzu, the Allied forces were
able to delve when and where the ground offensive was to take place, since
they had the initiative in the war. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-016#95:2>
Sun Tzu also
stressed deeply on the Human factor in war. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-016#96:2>
This
aspect by Sun Tzu was something that run through the writings of all
following strategic writers such as Clausewitz, Machiavelli, Moltke and
Liddell Hart. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-016#97:2>
The relevance of the human factor in its
crucial role in war, cannot be denied. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-016#98:2>
Sun Tzu had
indeed shown profound insight when he stressed the important relationship
between the government and the people, and the commanders and the soldiers.
<X> 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-016#X99:2>
Like Clausewitz he felt that the military should
subordinate itself to the government in power, which in turn had to fulfill
its duty of governing righteously. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-016#X100:2>
In a final
analysis, I strongly believe that what Liddell Hart commented about Sun Tzu
is indeed true. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-016#X101:2>
Sun Tzu's Art of War showing simple
principles of war has indeed proved its relevance. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-016#X102:2>
Mao Tse Tung has proved that to be a living testimony for the proving the 'concentrated
essence' of Sun Tzu's Art of War. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-016#X103:2>
By adopting to Sun
Tzu's principles he sucessfully gained power in China. </X> </I>
