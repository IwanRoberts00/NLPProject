<h> NICKNAME GIVING </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-012#2:1>
" Ant!

<ICE-SIN:W2B-012#3:1>
Ant!

<ICE-SIN:W2B-012#4:1>
Ant!" the boy called out as he stomped about repeatedly.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-012#5:1>
He danced in glee while his slippered feet went 'pap pap pap' in a
make-believe act of destruction.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-012#6:1>
He was a skinny, fair-faced, seven-year-old and his neat crew-cut and
dimpled cheeks belied the mischief was.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-012#7:1>
It was his eyes that often gave him away for they sparkled with
merriment whenever he was up to his pranks.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-012#8:1>
" Peng Peng...Pe-ng!

<ICE-SIN:W2B-012#9:1>
Pe-ng!" The shrill summons of his grandmother came from the tenth
storey of the block in front of where we stood, and it had the desired
effect.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-012#10:1>
Peng Peng shot a glance at me which said, " I'll be back," and then
he scampered off in the direction of his grandmother's flat.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-012#11:1>
The children had a knack for inventing nicknames that stuck so well
that you remember only 'Ah Fat' or 'Big Head', forgetting, and sometimes not
even knowing, what their parents had named them.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-012#12:1>
The names were generally given in a burst of spontaneity, as soon as
a new person was identified or his real name announced.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-012#13:1>
An association is usually made from he sound of the name or by
identifying an outstanding physical characteristic.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-012#14:1>
When I first met the children, I told them my name was Anne.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-012#15:1>
" Anne, Anne?...Ant!

<ICE-SIN:W2B-012#16:1>
Your name is Ant!" they sang.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-012#17:1>
In Hokkien, they would call me Ang Kau Hia ( or Hong Ma Yi, in
Mandarin) which literally means Red Ant.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-012#18:1>
That was how I came to be initiated into the world of the street
children of Bukit Ho Swee.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-012#19:1>
Bukit Ho Swee is the name of one of the oldest high-rise housing
estates in Singapore.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-012#20:1>
The name itself is rich in meaning.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-012#21:1>
Bukit is the Malay word for 'hill' and 'Ho Swee' was the name of a
wealthy Chinese merchant believed to have been the first opium and spirit
farmer in Singapore in those days when the estate was a poor squatter
settlement.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-012#22:1>
I prefer the two Chinese interpretations of Bukit Ho Swee.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-012#23:1>
In Mandarin, it's <foreign> He Shui Shan </foreign> which means River,
Water, Mountain ( or Hill).

<ICE-SIN:W2B-012#24:1>
In Hokkien, which is the main dialect of the Chinese people there, 'Ho'
is also the pronunciation for 'good' and 'Swee' is the word for 'beautiful'.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-012#25:1>
But looking at Bukit Ho Swee today, by no stretch of the imagination
can one expect to see a romantic picture of rolling hills and cool,
refreshing streams.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-012#26:1>
Instead, there is the harsh reality of a different kind of jungle.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-012#27:1>
Concrete blocks of a more or less predictable sameness, each carved
out and divided into equal parts by the type of dwelling - one-roomed,
two-roomed, or three.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-012#28:1>
The high-rise was a makeshift solution to a once urgent housing
problem.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-012#29:1>
Still - as those who knew Bukit Ho Swee in those days might say - it
was an improvement from the squalid conditions it had risen from,
phoenix-like.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-012#30:1>
In a great cleansing act, the conflagration of the Sixties had razed
to the ground row upon huddled row of attap, wooden and cardboard dwellings.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-012#31:1>
In less than a year, a record time, buildings grew into the sky and
concrete poured into what once were muddy, undefined tracks and pot-holed
alleys.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-012#32:1>
More than 25 years after the big fire, the children of the
nickname-giving generation have, like the birds of the new skyline, grown
accustomed to the nooks and crannies of the tall houses in their sky.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-012#33:1>
Except that for the children, this was the only home they knew.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-012#34:1>
For many of them, home was a room shared with father, mother,
brothers and sisters, and sleeping ( some under the bed)
shoulder-to-shoulder on the cool hard floor or a thin mattress.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-012#35:1>
Home was the comfort of a roof over your head, clean water at the
turn of a tap and a flush toilet.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-012#36:1>
But home was also the discomfort of shared noises through the days
and nights, looking out the window to look into your neighbour's window, and
trying to do your homework on the floor with Chinese soap opera blasting
nearby; it was looking after baby sister, running down to the coffee shop to
buy kopi-o in Milk-maid tin cans for mother's mahjong kaki and walking up and
down look-alike corridors selling otah otah or curry puffs and nasi-lemak.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-012#37:1>
I had a dream for this place and these people.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-012#38:1>
My dream was to see it good and beautiful, like a spring of water
that never runs dry.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-012#39:1>
My dream was for the children especially, for in them lay the seeds
of hope, waiting to be planted and needing to be nurtured.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-012#40:1>
<h> CHOPE CENTRE </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-012#41:1>
It was the challenge of working with the children that attracted me
to the Children's Hope Centre.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-012#42:1>
My job was to assist the Supervisor in just about any task to ensure
the smooth functioning of the Centre as a place to foster a spirit of
community among the young residents of Bukit Ho Swee.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-012#43:1>
With the help of volunteer workers, programmes such as children's
recreational clubs, tuition support groups and toddlers' play groups were
organised.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-012#44:1>
The children and parents came, they saw, and were won over.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-012#45:1>
The children liked the name of the Centre and promptly shortened it
to Chope Centre.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-012#46:1>
Chope is a word that Singaporeans use, meaning 'to reserve'.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-012#47:1>
If you wanted to reserve a seat for yourself or a friend, you say
chope.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-012#48:1>
When in the middle of an exciting game and everybody is talking at
the same time and you felt you had something important to say that couldn't
wait, you could put up your hand and say, " chope!

<ICE-SIN:W2B-012#49:1>
chope!

<ICE-SIN:W2B-012#50:1>
chope!".

<ICE-SIN:W2B-012#51:1>
Then you would get a good chance of putting in your two cents' worth.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-012#52:1>
CHope Centre, spelt with the capital 'H' so that the word Hope
remained clear, was for the children a place that belonged to them.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-012#53:1>
It was meant to be a place where seat was always reserved for each of
them, if ever and whenever they needed it; an alternative to the streets.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-012#54:1>
That, in spirit, was what the Children's Hope Centre was meant to be.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-012#55:1>
In reality, there was always the problem of a lack of space and
countless other seemingly insurmountable obstacles which in time became less
formidable as soon as we realised that we were human after all.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-012#56:1>
CHope Centre is situated near the fringe of Bukit Ho Swee estate but
a newcomer would be overwhelmed by the density of the many similar-looking
blocks.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-012#57:1>
The boundaries of the estate are demarcated by four main roads but
once inside this perimeter, one is bound to get confused by the branch roads
and undulating land on which the blocks of flats were built.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-012#58:1>
There is, of course, a system to it all, and once the blur of newness
gives way to familiarity, it becomes suddenly obvious that the blocks are
grouped together, and the groups are separated by little streets, one called
a crescent, another a jalan and yet another a taman.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-012#59:1>
Bukit Ho Swee had once provided accommodation for about 40,000
people.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-012#60:1>
Now, even though most of the one-roomed blocks have either been
demolished or converted into two-roomed units, and many residents have moved
out to the newer, better-designed estates, there still remains a large
proportion of the population who could not afford to go elsewhere.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-012#61:1>
Mostly, they are the people at the fringe of society: the hawker or
market stall-holder, the rag-and-bone man, road sweeper, Factory worker,
lorry-driver, the odd-job labourer.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-012#62:1>
When I first walked into Bukit Ho Swee, I felt a strangeness which
reminded me of the experience of moving house.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-012#63:1>
It is the feeling of leaving the old and safe world for a new and as
yet unknown world.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-012#64:1>
There is a sense of vulnerability mixed with quiet excitement.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-012#65:1>
As if secretly aware of the need to absorb as much as possibly can,
the body adapts to the new environment by being in a peculiar state of
relaxed alertness.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-012#66:1>
It is somewhat like having to watch your step without consciously
willing it.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-012#67:1>
The eyes are quick to notice the familiar, like the sight of the old
Teochew porridge seller, on cool nights squatting by the wayside, tempting
passers-by with her simple fare; and the ears attune themselves to
unaccustomed sounds, like the gay chatter of children at play or the loud
incessant clanging of Chinese funeral music.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-012#68:1>
Occupying a two-roomed shophouse unit on the ground floor of a
typical block of flats, the Children's Hope Centre was as unobtrusive as the
little biscuit-making shop next to it.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-012#69:1>
It was a corner unit and had the advantage of being accessible to the
residents, particuarly those of the neighbouring blocks.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-012#70:1>
In its early days, up to the late Seventies, CHope Centre depended on
the generosity of well-wishers for its existence and therefore operated on
the barest minimum in terms of space and other resources.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-012#71:1>
Of the two rooms, one functioned as an office and the other as an
activities room.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-012#72:1>
Both were small, so that out of necessity, the activities such as
tuition lessons, would often spill over and occupy part of the office as
well.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-012#73:1>
There was also a toilet and a tiny storeroom.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-012#74:1>
The latter also functioned as a mini-library and sometimes even a
study room.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-012#75:1>
Because the Centre was so small, it could never take in enough
children at one time.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-012#76:1>
It seemed as if half our problems with the children were an indirect
result of this predicament.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-012#77:1>
The Activities Room was about half the size of a school classroom.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-012#78:1>
Put in a few tables and chairs for the use of some twenty children
and three or four adult volunteer workers, and there would not be space left
for anything or any other person without overcrowding the room.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-012#79:1>
The office was even smaller, with enough room for two medium-sized
desks, one typist's table, a common table and some chairs, and a couple of
cabinets.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-012#80:1>
Every evening, different groups would take turns to use the place for
some form of creative programme for the children.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-012#81:1>
Children who were not involved in the programme in session were
always clamouring to get in.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-012#82:1>
They could not understand that we were not deliberately shutting them
out, that it was necessary for us to lock the gate because there was just not
enough room for all of them at the same time.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-012#83:1>
<h> FOUR VANTAGE POINTS </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-012#84:1>
The children were ingenious at finding ways and means to get in.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-012#85:1>
They wanted a piece of the action, and if they could not be inside,
it was perfectly logical to them that they should at least get into a
position where they could satisfy their curiosity in part, if not in full.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-012#86:1>
In that two-roomed unit, there were four points from which one could
get a view, more or less, of the goings-on in the Centre.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-012#87:1>
View Number One was from the back doorway, which in practice had
become the main entrance to the Centre.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-012#88:1>
Next to it, about four paces to the right was View Number Two, the
view from the window of the storeroom.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-012#89:1>
The third view could be had by climbing and somehow hanging on to the
grilles at the top of the main entrance which was kept closed most of the
time, and had become another wall of the Activities Room.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-012#90:1>
The fourth view was the view from the window of the office.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-012#91:1>
I had often thought that if this window could talk, it would have
plenty of stories to tell.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-012#92:1>
In fact, each and every one of these views had been witness to many a
memorable incident.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-012#93:1>
The back doorway consisted of a wooden door and a collapsible metal
gate.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-012#94:1>
Both were very ordinary-looking, like all the other standardised
doors and grille gates of the housing estate.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-012#95:1>
The gate, however, gave added meaning to the word 'collapsible'.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-012#96:1>
It had the worn-out appearance of having barely survived years of
constant rattling and shaking; of being climbed on, kicked at, and even
cursed at, by numerous angry and impatient children demanding to be let in or
simply wanting attention.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-012#97:1>
The view from this gate ( the wooden door was usually left open) was
not very good because it looked into a little corridor and it was only from a
particular, narrow angle that one could see part of the Activities Room. <X>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-012#X98:1>
To the right of the corridor was the toilet.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-012#X99:1>
View Number Two was the worst since it depended on the chance that
the window of the storeroom was left open. </X> </I>
