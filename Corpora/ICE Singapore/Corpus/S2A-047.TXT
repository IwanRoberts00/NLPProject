Good afternoon

<ICE-SIN:S2A-047#2:1:A>
I'm from the Faculty of Engineering and uhm for the last forty-five
minutes before the tea break our group got together

<ICE-SIN:S2A-047#3:1:A>
And for the first twenty minutes what we did was we spent that time
introducing ourselves to one another

<ICE-SIN:S2A-047#4:1:A>
And so we ended up with only twenty minutes to talk about teaching
in large groups

<ICE-SIN:S2A-047#5:1:A>
In fact uhm after the first twenty minutes Professor Elton walked
into the room and said uh you know which stage of your discussion are you at

<ICE-SIN:S2A-047#6:1:A>
And we said that we just finished introducing ourselves and he was a
little surprised

<ICE-SIN:S2A-047#7:1:A>
But we thought that it would be helpful since we were going to be
together for the next few days to get to know a little bit about each other

<ICE-SIN:S2A-047#8:1:A>
But for the remaining twenty minutes that we were together we went
around and said something about what are some common difficulties or
struggles we encounter when we first start lecturing

<ICE-SIN:S2A-047#9:1:A>
And we tried to identify some common features or common problems
which were faced by uhm the members in the group

<ICE-SIN:S2A-047#10:1:A>
I think one area that cropped up was the area of how much material
to present in a lecture and we had differing views

<ICE-SIN:S2A-047#11:1:A>
I think there was one member who said that within an hour he tried
to cover something in the region of thirty to thirty-five transparencies and
uh the rest of us were a little surprised to say the least

<ICE-SIN:S2A-047#12:1:A>
And someone else expressed a different experience whereby he was
given three hours for a Masters class

<ICE-SIN:S2A-047#13:1:A>
And by the time I think about two hours was through he had finished
everything so he declared an early end to the lecture

<ICE-SIN:S2A-047#14:1:A>
And so we we talked about how much material one uh needs to present
and I think this is very much subject dependent and also related to how much
time you feel you should dwell on certain parts of your uh transparencies

<ICE-SIN:S2A-047#15:1:A>
Because it's probably not possible to say that one transparency is
equal to exactly uhm five minutes or or less

<ICE-SIN:S2A-047#16:1:A>
But the point that was brought up was that in Engineering a lot of
our work is mathematical in nature

<ICE-SIN:S2A-047#17:1:A>
So how does one go about presenting uh mathematical equations or in
a transparency form

<ICE-SIN:S2A-047#18:1:A>
And uh I think we came to a conclusion that it was probably better
to spend time and explaining something if we were going to present it rather
than doing uh half uhm half-baked job of it

<ICE-SIN:S2A-047#19:1:A>
So if we weren't going to spend time on it it's probably best not
to present it

<ICE-SIN:S2A-047#20:1:A>
Those were some of the highlights of our discussion

<ICE-SIN:S2A-047#21:1:A>
And I think I probably run out of five minutes now so I'll pass you
to the next person

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-047#22:1:B>
That reminds me I have to keep my watch five minutes

<ICE-SIN:S2A-047#23:1:B>
Uh we spend a lot of time trying to figure out what to discuss or
at least that that's something that I do but not what the members did

<ICE-SIN:S2A-047#24:1:B>
They chipped in with good discussions and we kind of uh first uh
agree on uh use of transparencies that is it's something that is a must for a
large lectures

<ICE-SIN:S2A-047#25:1:B>
It helps students to uh focus uh on what is being taught

<ICE-SIN:S2A-047#26:1:B>
And the slower students can find that as a guide uhm a route map so
to speak

<ICE-SIN:S2A-047#27:1:B>
Then we discussed on the use of notes whether uhm it's a good idea
to hand out notes to students

<ICE-SIN:S2A-047#28:1:B>
Uh some say it's good because it saves uh students' time in having
to hunt down the uh uh reference text

<ICE-SIN:S2A-047#29:1:B>
Whereas some say it's bad because uh that will make students not
read the textbooks

<ICE-SIN:S2A-047#30:1:B>
And so uhm it was lively discussion and we concluded that uhm
basically if you hand out notes uh you should not substitute for a textbook

<ICE-SIN:S2A-047#31:1:B>
But should really help student to uh uh use the notes to help them
understand the course better

<ICE-SIN:S2A-047#32:1:B>
And then I concluded by asking if there were some uh secrets that
some staff might want to share uh given that Prof Chow has shared with us
some secret uh earlier on in a in a lecture

<ICE-SIN:S2A-047#33:1:B>
And a member suggested that if students don't answer question being
shy as they are you could ask them to write their answers to uh questions
that are given out to them on papers

<ICE-SIN:S2A-047#34:1:B>
And then ask them to exchange uh the papers with the colleagues and
have someone else read out the answers

<ICE-SIN:S2A-047#35:1:B>
In this case you'll prompt them to uh answer the questions and on
that note I think we pretty much round up the uh forty-five minutes that we
have

<ICE-SIN:S2A-047#36:1:B>
Uhm I'm not sure if I made the five minutes but but these are the
few points that I have

<ICE-SIN:S2A-047#37:1:B>
Thank you

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-047#38:1:C>
My group started off with uh looking at some of the issues in
uh small groups and uh the reason for this is that's because we are closer to
uh that kind of teaching especially with the group

<ICE-SIN:S2A-047#39:1:C>
But uh there are some pertinent questions that were raised like for
example the the students' mentality

<ICE-SIN:S2A-047#40:1:C>
Especially when they are looking for setter <unclear> word
</unclear> answers uh whether this is something they brought into the
classroom or they uh took it from the classroom

<ICE-SIN:S2A-047#41:1:C>
The other point that was uh raised uhm in this small group teaching
is that sometimes it is very difficult especially when students found out a
way on how to specialise in activities

<ICE-SIN:S2A-047#42:1:C>
Uh they divide up their work and then they specialise on that
particular part and they present it

<ICE-SIN:S2A-047#43:1:C>
And if it is not their responsibility they will just leave it alone
and therefore they couldn't keep up with the discussion of the particular
group that presented

<ICE-SIN:S2A-047#44:1:C>
When it comes to large group uh teaching is the problem of sheer
numbers

<ICE-SIN:S2A-047#45:1:C>
And the group felt that because of the sheer numbers the personal
contact to the students the bonding with the students has been lost

<ICE-SIN:S2A-047#46:1:C>
And uh special efforts would have to be made sometimes even outside
the classroom uh to get back this relationship with the students

<ICE-SIN:S2A-047#47:1:C>
Uh because in speaking to the students in a large class a kind of
rapport will have to be established in order to get the message through

<ICE-SIN:S2A-047#48:1:C>
Also in a large class teaching it was found that we need actually
to have uh the attention of the students

<ICE-SIN:S2A-047#49:1:C>
And the discussion went onto how to have a control of the whole
class

<ICE-SIN:S2A-047#50:1:C>
Uh one staff mention that uhm the eye control is very important

<ICE-SIN:S2A-047#51:1:C>
Uhm the other mention that if we are going to get the attention
then the we probably may need some rules

<ICE-SIN:S2A-047#52:1:C>
Now coming to this eye contact I just want to relate a personal
experience of mine

<ICE-SIN:S2A-047#53:1:C>
Uhm eye contact is the meeting of eyes but uh sometimes when I
lecture especially in my early days is more of the meeting of heads

<ICE-SIN:S2A-047#54:1:C>
Uh the reason is this that when I'm writing something on the
transparencies the students see my head

<ICE-SIN:S2A-047#55:1:C>
And when I look out they were copying the board and so I see their
heads

<ICE-SIN:S2A-047#56:1:C>
So the sometimes uhm the eye contact is being lost is more the
meeting of heads

<ICE-SIN:S2A-047#57:1:C>
Just to uhm uh round up the uh discussion we also explore the
possibility of brainstorming as uhm Professor uh Nathan has mention

<ICE-SIN:S2A-047#58:1:C>
Uh but our comment was that if we start off brainstorming and in
the middle of a lecture and uh students starts talking to each other it may
be very hard to actually stop them

<ICE-SIN:S2A-047#59:1:C>
And if we have a sixty minutes lecture uh we could find that you
have a time constraint

<ICE-SIN:S2A-047#60:1:C>
Thank you

<$D> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-047#61:1:D>
Well thank you uhm to all the panel members here for their
inputs

<ICE-SIN:S2A-047#62:1:D>
Uh there are four other groups out there uh can we we have some uh
feedback from those groups the panel leaders for those groups before we we
open it up all for general discussion

<ICE-SIN:S2A-047#63:1:D>
What about the group uh from the Arts and Social Science group one

<ICE-SIN:S2A-047#64:1:D>
John John Elliot

<ICE-SIN:S2A-047#65:1:D>
<O> John Elliot </O>

<$D> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-047#66:1:D>
Thank you

<ICE-SIN:S2A-047#67:1:D>
What about uh group two

<ICE-SIN:S2A-047#68:1:D>
Group two is uh Doctor uh Associate Professor Rahman

<$E> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-047#69:1:E>
Okay actually we just uhm went on from where you ended in uh
your talk of preparation presentation and reviews

<ICE-SIN:S2A-047#70:1:E>
Uh we had uh Professor Yeo and I prepared some transparencies and
in the form of the handouts exactly the way we lecture so we were conducting
the same thing uhm in advance to discuss

<ICE-SIN:S2A-047#71:1:E>
To the three points you had preparation presentation and review we
had added two more

<ICE-SIN:S2A-047#72:1:E>
The first one was the interest and attitude towards teaching which
we felt was a prerequisite to a effective teaching

<ICE-SIN:S2A-047#73:1:E>
And then the lastly some specific issues and problems

<ICE-SIN:S2A-047#74:1:E>
Uhm in these uhm I think in the preparation uh point which was
discussed to considerable length is that we had this uh category in the
preparation we had several categories

<ICE-SIN:S2A-047#75:1:E>
Know your students and audience well and their background and so on
before you can even prepare your lectures

<ICE-SIN:S2A-047#76:1:E>
Also you should know your material well and uh the question that
was asked

<ICE-SIN:S2A-047#77:1:E>
And it's a very valid question which almost took half of the time
of the discussion is what happens if you get the subjects which are not your
expertise and you are assigned to teach

<ICE-SIN:S2A-047#78:1:E>
Worse still if you are assigned to teach things at the last minute

<ICE-SIN:S2A-047#79:1:E>
Uh we all agreed that in order to prepare a good effective lecture
you need a good amount of time sometimes weeks to get a very good lecture
ready

<ICE-SIN:S2A-047#80:1:E>
And what if three o'clock in the afternoon you are told that this
is the course you will be teaching next day

<ICE-SIN:S2A-047#81:1:E>
Uhm very valid point probably uhm some lecturers if they are going
to teach the same course in the next years

<ICE-SIN:S2A-047#82:1:E>
And the following years they can take it alright from next year on

<ICE-SIN:S2A-047#83:1:E>
I will have a easier time

<ICE-SIN:S2A-047#84:1:E>
But if what if their courses keep on changing and they have to face
this problem over and over again something which is worth looking into

<ICE-SIN:S2A-047#85:1:E>
Uhm in the methodology section of course the outline was very
important

<ICE-SIN:S2A-047#86:1:E>
The handout question was brought in and in the Faculty of Arts for
example handouts are very discouraged

<ICE-SIN:S2A-047#87:1:E>
Uhm even though the students love it so what's the compromise

<ICE-SIN:S2A-047#88:1:E>
And I think what we uh came to is the handouts should not replace
the lectures themselves

<ICE-SIN:S2A-047#89:1:E>
Uh in our faculty every beginning of the year you'll have uh notice
board full of these sale notices

<ICE-SIN:S2A-047#90:1:E>
The students are selling notes and handouts from the previous years

<ICE-SIN:S2A-047#91:1:E>
Even the essays from the previous exam answers and all that sort of
thing

<ICE-SIN:S2A-047#92:1:E>
So if these can be replaced obviously why should the students come
to the lecture to begin with

<ICE-SIN:S2A-047#93:1:E>
They might just buy those and study those and pass the exam

<ICE-SIN:S2A-047#94:1:E>
Uhm presentation and delivery the uhm lecturer's style we went
through these the manner of delivery

<ICE-SIN:S2A-047#95:1:E>
One important point which was emphasised during this manner of
delivery was to keep the language especially for the first year students
especially in our faculty where a lot of our students come from very various
background

<ICE-SIN:S2A-047#96:1:E>
Uhm Business students Sciences students taking Arts and so on and
they maybe taking say Geography or whatever

<ICE-SIN:S2A-047#97:1:E>
And they never had Geography before and suddenly they have to face
these

<ICE-SIN:S2A-047#98:1:E>
So one has to keep the professional language to the minimum and to
the level of the poorest the student in the group

<ICE-SIN:S2A-047#99:1:E>
Uhm the use of the audio-visual again uhm many of us show videos or
things like that

<ICE-SIN:S2A-047#100:1:E>
They have to be more interactive not just passive

<ICE-SIN:S2A-047#101:1:E>
Uhm in the review the feedback we discussed uhm the formal
feedback which our faculty has

<ICE-SIN:S2A-047#102:1:E>
And I guess other faculties do too at the end of the year

<ICE-SIN:S2A-047#103:1:E>
Uhm one could debate about the validity of that as far as the
improvement is teaching is concerned </I>
