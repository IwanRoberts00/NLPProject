Hi

<ICE-SIN:S1B-031#2:1:A>
I'm Peter Lim and it's mother's day

<ICE-SIN:S1B-031#3:1:A>
Hi mom and all the other mothers out there happy mother's day

<ICE-SIN:S1B-031#4:1:A>
It's a happy coincidence that we're discussing men tonight

<ICE-SIN:S1B-031#5:1:A>
After all all men come from women

<ICE-SIN:S1B-031#6:1:A>
Men come in various guises

<ICE-SIN:S1B-031#7:1:A>
There's a gentleman the new man and remember the old brute

<ICE-SIN:S1B-031#8:1:A>
Then there are those confuse guys who make the girls feel so sorry
for them

<ICE-SIN:S1B-031#9:1:A>
So what's it really like to be a man in Singapore today

<ICE-SIN:S1B-031#10:1:A>
Take me for example

<ICE-SIN:S1B-031#11:1:A>
Am I the typical male

<ICE-SIN:S1B-031#12:1:A>
Are you the model man

<ICE-SIN:S1B-031#13:1:A>
And if you're a woman what is it take you expect of your man the
ideal man

<ICE-SIN:S1B-031#14:1:A>
To help us define or redefine the Singapore man I have a fair
distribution in the studio tonight one woman and two man Let's get to know
them

<ICE-SIN:S1B-031#15:1:A>

You're a mor moral educationalist and like me a bachelor

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-031#28:1:C>
Oh sorry I didn't realise I had company

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-031#29:1:A>
I've company too and Anthony you are a family therapist
husband and a father

<ICE-SIN:S1B-031#30:1:A>
Welcome to the studio tonight

<ICE-SIN:S1B-031#31:1:A>
We're talking about men Singapore men and what society and women
and men themselves expect of the Singapore male

<ICE-SIN:S1B-031#32:1:A>
So can I start with you

<ICE-SIN:S1B-031#33:1:A>
You must be expect on the men

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-031#34:1:B>
Well I hope not

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-031#35:1:A>
Well Janice you took a year's leave from work to look after
your son Ryan who is now three three years old right

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-031#36:1:B>
Almost three

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-031#37:1:A>
But why did you take twelve months away from work

<ICE-SIN:S1B-031#38:1:A>
Why not your husband

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-031#39:1:B>
A simplistic answer would be I suppose that's because I'm his
mother and that's expected of me

<ICE-SIN:S1B-031#40:1:B>
But uhm I truly do feel that it is the woman's role to be the
mother and as much as my husband loves our son and everything I think women
do give uhm women were meant to be mothers and there's a nurturing quality to
women that perhaps uh I hope I don't get into trouble but perhaps doesn't
come as naturally to a man

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-031#41:1:A>
Anthony are you reassured to hear that

<$D> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-031#42:1:D>
I am not

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-031#43:1:A>
You're not

<$D> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-031#44:1:D>
Ya

<ICE-SIN:S1B-031#45:1:D>
Because one of the problems is that we sometimes do not let the man
become a human being to allow that nurturing part of him to surface

<ICE-SIN:S1B-031#46:1:D>
I think a man can also express this gentleness nurturing spirits
and so on

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-031#47:1:A>
Let's let's try and get into the minds of some of the uh male
viewers tonight

<ICE-SIN:S1B-031#48:1:A>
But how many do you think will agree with what Anthony said

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-031#49:1:C>
Uh maybe not too many

<ICE-SIN:S1B-031#50:1:C>
I've often said I'm not too sure whether it's process or
socialisation

<ICE-SIN:S1B-031#51:1:C>
I tend to think it is

<ICE-SIN:S1B-031#52:1:C>
But I don't think too many men would uh for instance uh cry readily
in public or in front of someone else wouldn't mind if I cry in private well
I own up

<ICE-SIN:S1B-031#53:1:C>
But the whole

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-031#54:1:A>
What's the point of crying in I mean

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-031#55:1:C>
Ya but uh you know out of sheer sorrow for instance let's say
they they lost their wife or lost their mother they cry out of sheer grief
you know uh but they jolly well make sure that nobody's around to see that
because they'd feel that that that's being soft you know

<ICE-SIN:S1B-031#56:1:C>
Uhm I think that's the mentality of most men and believe me they're
probably brought up like that

<ICE-SIN:S1B-031#57:1:C>
I don't blame the men

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-031#58:1:A>
So you blame the mothers do you

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-031#59:1:C>
I think so in a sense because uh you you you see this with
with every mother

<ICE-SIN:S1B-031#60:1:C>
If a kid falls down and uh if it happens to your boy and he yells
and cries the mother picks him up and say come on you're a big boy boys don't
cry

<ICE-SIN:S1B-031#61:1:C>
Oh that that is being told to the chap from very young

<ICE-SIN:S1B-031#62:1:C>
If a girl falls down and cry then no problem

<ICE-SIN:S1B-031#63:1:C>
Sayang the chap you know it's it's it's kind of natural you know

<ICE-SIN:S1B-031#64:1:C>
I remember being told that many many times when I was a little kid

<ICE-SIN:S1B-031#65:1:C>
Boys don't cry

<ICE-SIN:S1B-031#66:1:C>
You're a big boy now you don't cry so you know you you you grow
with the mentality I mustn't cry

<$D> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-031#67:1:D>
And I agree with Bob here you see

<ICE-SIN:S1B-031#68:1:D>
There's a reality that we define men in a certain way women in a
certain way

<ICE-SIN:S1B-031#69:1:D>
And in that sense we limit the men they say

<ICE-SIN:S1B-031#70:1:D>
In my therapy room we find men having that privacy that uh
permissional most you know to express their emotions when in pain due to

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-031#71:1:A>
They do or they don't

<$D> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-031#72:1:D>
They do they do due to difficulties in life or or problem with
relationship and I see a lot of man crying you know
ICE-SIN:S1B-031#> So it's it's like so sad you know that you you you have to pay somebody
for an opportunity to cry

<ICE-SIN:S1B-031#73:1:D>
I mean wouldn't he be better if he brought up to to to be permitted
to express emotions and perhaps express them appropriately too so that we do
not get some men who have difficulty expressing emotions and then they end up
with a lot of aggressive feelings and some of them then end up beating up
their wives or hammering things or killing themselves or you know bestrewn
things altogether

<ICE-SIN:S1B-031#74:1:D>
I think I they be allowed to to get in touch with this part of
themselves

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-031#75:1:A>
Society now says Singapore at least that men must change right
and the the then Prime Minister in uh July 1990 says that uh new attitudes
have to change if Singapore women are to successfully juggle their roles at
home and at work

<ICE-SIN:S1B-031#76:1:A>
So society is demanding that Bob

<ICE-SIN:S1B-031#77:1:A>
Are the men responding or are they getting more confused or more
reactionary

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-031#78:1:C>
Uhm I guess it's a bit difficult to answer that outright in
terms of uh equality lie for instance equal pay and treatment and that sort
of thing everything else being equal

<ICE-SIN:S1B-031#79:1:C>
Uh then I think you know that's that that much change I suppose if
it adds to a large extent but there must be some areas which are you know
there is still that kind of a differentiation

<ICE-SIN:S1B-031#80:1:C>
But on the other hand uhm I would think it'd be totally unnecessary
I wouldn't want men to change uh in terms of uh the niceties that he shows to
a to a lady etceteras etceteras etceteras you know

<ICE-SIN:S1B-031#81:1:C>
Uhm I've been accused of being male chauvinist because I open doors
for ladies

<ICE-SIN:S1B-031#82:1:C>
Uhm because it seems that's an indication that I consider the other
sex

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-031#83:1:B>
Weak

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-031#84:1:C>
I don't know weaker and

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-031#85:1:B>
They can't open their own doors

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-031#86:1:A>
So do you still do it

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-031#87:1:C>
Absolutely and I think will absolutely defend and when I teach
courtesy to to kids that I teach them to do it uhm because I think it's nice

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-031#88:1:A>
I've been told to stop doing it

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-031#89:1:C>
Sorry

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-031#90:1:A>
I've been told to stop doing it

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-031#91:1:C>
Yes so have I

<ICE-SIN:S1B-031#92:1:C>
I was told that in public in in a discussion once you know that I
was being chauvinist

<ICE-SIN:S1B-031#93:1:C>
I said what carry on but I like being chauvinist and somehow or
rather the female friends I mix with seem to like my chauvinism in that area
at least you know

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-031#94:1:A>
Janice

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-031#95:1:B>
Which is how I feel actually men are quite confused you know

<ICE-SIN:S1B-031#96:1:B>
Uhm on the one hand they're expected to now be sensitive and
emotional and those are very good I mean those are the things that keep a
relationship alive

<ICE-SIN:S1B-031#97:1:B>
At the same time the woman also I think I think if if if I can be
used as an example I'm just your average woman right we also want the men to
remain protective

<ICE-SIN:S1B-031#98:1:B>
We also want the maleness you know of the men to come through so
while I want him to learn to share his emotions with me to learn to to to
nurturing and everything uhm I think I also have a responsibility to in
teaching him how to bring it out because you can't just say the man has to
change full stop and I am a woman and I demand this

<ICE-SIN:S1B-031#99:1:B>
I know I depend on my husband for all the practical things in life

<ICE-SIN:S1B-031#100:1:B>
Uhm he depends on me for the emotional support that I can give you
know so it's it's a partnership lah you know

<$D> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-031#101:1:D>
I I come to think in the sense it's sad lah you know

<ICE-SIN:S1B-031#102:1:D>
I don't think we should just focus on men's changing you know
because men has to change in relation to something and it's in realism to the
changing expectations of women as well of <unclear> word </unclear> even
other men

<ICE-SIN:S1B-031#103:1:D>
So I I agree with you in that sense I mean it has to be something
mutual and I also agree that there is this confusion that is setting because
with all the demands of men to change sometimes the man is not quite sure as
to what he ought to be you see at the end of the day and that may add to the
confusion I suppose

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-031#104:1:A>
But do you personally feel confused

<ICE-SIN:S1B-031#105:1:A>
Do you or do you what you should be

<$D> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-031#106:1:D>
I suppose I suppose that there's some point you can be
because then you ask yourself what do they want you see

<ICE-SIN:S1B-031#107:1:D>
So you're you're told for example okay you you you you must let
the woman be more than that you know passive uh submissive person so you let
her be okay but then the next moment you stand back and you refuse to open
the door for her for example and then she just much in

<ICE-SIN:S1B-031#108:1:D>
Then then you get the snag remark that you don't want to wait for
me first you know open the door

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-031#109:1:B>
I think there's a different issue between chauvinism and
gallantry

<$D> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-031#110:1:D>
There's some confusion

<ICE-SIN:S1B-031#111:1:D>
I'm I'm just it's a maybe a silly minor example but but there's a
bit of confusion there

<ICE-SIN:S1B-031#112:1:D>
So likewise with other areas to in just with what Janice is saying

<ICE-SIN:S1B-031#113:1:D>
You know what we're talking about letting the men express emotions
some women cannot handle that because the moment you see that coming out from
the man you think he's being less than a man when like I said before you said
it's actually being more human you see

<ICE-SIN:S1B-031#114:1:D>
So that may lead to the confusion

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-031#115:1:A>
Well we talked about uh different demands on men which are
causing confusion among men and you you of all people I'm surprise to hear
that you too are a bit confused

<ICE-SIN:S1B-031#116:1:A>
Uh you mentioned maleness and after the break I'll like to ask you
to elaborate on that

<ICE-SIN:S1B-031#117:1:A>
It's time for a commercial break we'll be back

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-031#118:1:A>
Before the break we are talking about how confused we poor
men are

<ICE-SIN:S1B-031#119:1:A>
Bob and I have two things in common at least

<ICE-SIN:S1B-031#120:1:A>
We're both bachelors and both of us have been scolded by women for
opening car doors and other doors for them

<ICE-SIN:S1B-031#121:1:A>
Anthony in the other hand have has seen men being scolded for not
opening doors for women

<ICE-SIN:S1B-031#122:1:A>
So Janice what do you women want

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-031#123:1:B>
I don't know

<ICE-SIN:S1B-031#124:1:B>
Uhm I think women want a balance and I think there's a difference
between chauvinism and just plain politeness or gallantry old world chunk and
I think if you if women want to bring it down to something as ridiculous as
don't open the door for me because I'm macho enough to open my own door then
it's I think bringing things to the extreme

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-031#125:1:A>
But there are different there're women with different
attitudes right

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-031#126:1:B>
Ya

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-031#127:1:A>
So you represent

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-031#128:1:B>
The middle ground

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-031#129:1:A>
Middle ground

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-031#130:1:B>
I enjoy being a woman

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-031#131:1:A>
Okay <X>

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-031#X132:1:B>
But that doesn't mean I enjoy being trampled on by the men
There are certain roles I think of the men has to play just as there are
certain roles that a woman plays is just you know it's just the way of the
world right And which is not so that if he cries he's being less of a man but
there are certain things a certain take chargeness uhm a woman I think must
feel that she can depend on her man you know not to fall to pieces in a
crisis to be able to make decisions for the family if they cannot reach some
Somebody has to you know to to to be a leader to be to be the person that you
can depend on He is the person that uhm there's certain male attributes that
he should have lah you know

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-031#X133:1:A>
Is it

<$D> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-031#X134:1:D>
That's that's not necessary that's not necessary being male
you know I think I think it is

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-031#X135:1:A>
And apart from that is it unfair burden to the poor guy

<$D> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-031#X136:1:D>
Precisely precisely you see So why should the man be
burdened with all these responsibilities

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-031#X137:1:B>
Because the wife has to take care of the running of the
household so that <unclear> word </unclear> him to

<$D> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-031#X138:1:D>
But the man the man the man the man is also changing and and
why can't the man uh woman be the provider as well so that the man can make a
change too He can do other things that he wants to because if you do not
allow the man to do that then you get to a position where the woman have
choices you see she can decide that this is what I like to do I like to be a
full-time mother I like to be part-time mother I like to be full-time worker
outside I like to do this or that But the man has no choice virtually he has
all the responsibilities of being the provider the decision-maker the take
charge person you know <unclear> word </unclear> can't even out

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-031#X139:1:B>
No no no I'm saying when it comes to the crunch you know
somebody must

<$D> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-031#X140:1:D>
Why can't it be the woman

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-031#X141:1:B>
If the woman can make up her mind Sure you

<$D> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-031#X142:1:D>
Why why not I mean as a man I'll like the woman to do that
too so that in a sense we then you know allow for this interchangibility
because I these are not necessary static roles you see I mean and they can be
flexible and there can be interchangibility between the man and the woman
</X> </I>
