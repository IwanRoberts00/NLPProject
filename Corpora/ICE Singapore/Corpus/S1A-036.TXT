<ICE-SIN:S1A-036#37:1:B>
Wow

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-036#38:1:B>
It's still a booklet you know

<ICE-SIN:S1A-036#39:1:B>

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-036#41:1:C>
Amended instruction some more

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-036#42:1:B>
Ya

<ICE-SIN:S1A-036#43:1:B>
I mean it's so thick uh you probably can't tell where the
amendments are made unless you highlight it all

<ICE-SIN:S1A-036#44:1:B>
Maybe if you could just issue the amended pages you know because I
mean I'm only interested in the work I'm doing

<ICE-SIN:S1A-036#45:1:B>
Waste of I mean he's a perfectionist lah

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-036#46:1:C>

Ah

<ICE-SIN:S1A-036#48:1:B>

<ICE-SIN:S1A-036#49:1:B>
There from there I gathered that he he's very meticulous

<ICE-SIN:S1A-036#50:1:B>
He did all these all those things by himself

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-036#51:1:C>

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-036#64:1:B>
Ya

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-036#65:1:A>
It will take a number of years

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-036#66:1:B>
Serious

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-036#67:1:A>
Serious

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-036#68:1:B>
So you will be with it

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-036#69:1:A>
Not necessarily

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-036#70:1:B>
Oh

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-036#71:1:A>
Ya the project itself will <unclear> word </unclear>

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-036#72:1:B>
Last for so long

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-036#73:1:A>
Uhm

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-036#74:1:B>
But you don't have to be with it

<ICE-SIN:S1A-036#75:1:B>
You're not bonded to committed

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-036#76:1:A>
No no no it's a one-year contract

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-036#77:1:B>
Oh

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-036#78:1:A>
Subject to renewal

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-036#79:1:B>
Is that

<ICE-SIN:S1A-036#80:1:B>
I see

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-036#81:1:A>
Ya

<ICE-SIN:S1A-036#82:1:A>
Have you started looking for other jobs

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-036#83:1:B>
Me

<ICE-SIN:S1A-036#84:1:B>
I got an offer but I'm not very keen

<ICE-SIN:S1A-036#85:1:B>
Even before he gave me a firm offer I was really feeling quite
uneasy about the job already

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-036#86:1:A>
Why

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-036#87:1:B>
Because when I was quite happy after the first interview but
when they offered me I mean just unofficially

<ICE-SIN:S1A-036#88:1:B>
They asked me to go down for meeting to discuss the my my no my
period of notice and other terms

<ICE-SIN:S1A-036#89:1:B>
I found out that they don't even have a HRD

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-036#90:1:A>
Uh I see

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-036#91:1:B>
Human Resource department ya

<ICE-SIN:S1A-036#92:1:B>
A lot of things are not properly done so I'm quite hesitant lah

<ICE-SIN:S1A-036#93:1:B>
Started be care feeling hesitant about it and you know to

<ICE-SIN:S1A-036#94:1:B>
So I I I I want to put it nicely when they offered me the job at a
certain price I quoted

<ICE-SIN:S1A-036#95:1:B>
I I asked for something much higher

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-036#96:1:A>
Uhm

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-036#97:1:B>
Like much higher means uh it's about six more than five
thousand dollars higher

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-036#98:1:A>
I see

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-036#99:1:B>
Ya

<ICE-SIN:S1A-036#100:1:B>
So I was thinking maybe they'll turn me down immediately you see
but they say they'll think about it

<ICE-SIN:S1A-036#101:1:B>
Then yesterday they call me and tell me they will give me

<ICE-SIN:S1A-036#102:1:B>
So I said oh oh

<ICE-SIN:S1A-036#103:1:B>
But the problem was we did we you see they talk so much you know
so much so that when I wanted to ask them certain things uh I didn't have a
chance and then I forgot

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-036#104:1:A>
Uhm

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-036#105:1:B>
Ya so you know things like how many months' notice I must
give how many days' annual leave are you giving me and things like that

<ICE-SIN:S1A-036#106:1:B>
It was not mentioned at all until they called me yesterday

<ICE-SIN:S1A-036#107:1:B>
I have to give three months' notice

<ICE-SIN:S1A-036#108:1:B>
I have to I've only get I I'll only be getting fourteen days'
annual leave

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-036#109:1:A>
Oh

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-036#110:1:B>
Which is the same as here

<ICE-SIN:S1A-036#111:1:B>
That's what I was telling him about you see

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-036#112:1:A>
Uhm

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-036#113:1:B>
I'm hoping that I'll get something more unless it's a
five-day week then fourteen days is okay you see

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-036#114:1:A>
Ya

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-036#115:1:B>
Then he said oh

<ICE-SIN:S1A-036#116:1:B>
He qualified lah

<ICE-SIN:S1A-036#117:1:B>
He said they will be looking into that uh in the following in the
next one year because they are thinking of coming up with some company policy

<ICE-SIN:S1A-036#118:1:B>
But the that's not a promise you see

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-036#119:1:A>
Uhm

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-036#120:1:B>
So I was very hesitant so I told him I need to think think
about it

<ICE-SIN:S1A-036#121:1:B>
Then he was quite surprised because it so happened that yesterday
morning I received a call from another application another letter company
that I wrote to

<ICE-SIN:S1A-036#122:1:B>
And they asked me to go down for interview on Monday

<ICE-SIN:S1A-036#123:1:B>
So initially I I saw like I was I was not sure whether I wanted to
oops oh dear

<ICE-SIN:S1A-036#124:1:B>
So I just took a number I told them I'll call them if I want to go
down for interview

<ICE-SIN:S1A-036#125:1:B>
Then after I spoke to this guy uh I decided to try another job

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-036#126:1:A>
Oh

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-036#127:1:B>
So I'll be going for interview on Monday

<ICE-SIN:S1A-036#128:1:B>
I didn't really feel very peaceful about it lah so I don't want

<ICE-SIN:S1A-036#129:1:B>
But I didn't tell him no straightaway

<ICE-SIN:S1A-036#130:1:B>
I told him I'll think about it

<ICE-SIN:S1A-036#131:1:B>
Then I told him actually I'm considering other offers

<ICE-SIN:S1A-036#132:1:B>
My main concern is if my present employer can promote me this July
I'll stay

<ICE-SIN:S1A-036#133:1:B>
I'm waiting for a word from them only

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-036#134:1:A>
Oh

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-036#135:1:B>
I've already spoken to them so I'm waiting for them

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-036#136:1:C>
Do we alight

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-036#137:1:B>
You mean here uh

<ICE-SIN:S1A-036#138:1:B>
Not here right

<ICE-SIN:S1A-036#139:1:B>
Can we alight

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-036#140:1:C>
How come they don't have a you know taxi stand or something

<ICE-SIN:S1A-036#147:1:B>
I said I'm not immune to this weather <unclear> word </unclear> ya

<ICE-SIN:S1A-036#148:1:B>
You may stay here for one hundred years and you cannot be immune
to it and still be subject to all the heat and all that

<ICE-SIN:S1A-036#149:1:B>
Jo is very funny

<ICE-SIN:S1A-036#150:1:B>
She was late so she couldn't go to Lily's house to meet us

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-036#151:1:A>
Uhm

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-036#152:1:B>
So she called up to say that she'll meet us at the Botanic
Gardens

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-036#153:1:A>
Uhm

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-036#154:1:B>
And when we went there we were late so she was furious

<ICE-SIN:S1A-036#155:1:B>
She say she took the cab to one entrance and she waited and waited

<ICE-SIN:S1A-036#156:1:B>
She says she'll be there before eight

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-036#157:1:A>
Uhm

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-036#158:1:B>
We got there at eight-thirty you see and then she walked from
that entrance to that entrance

<ICE-SIN:S1A-036#159:1:B>
It so happened that when she got when she got to the other
entrance we just arrived

<ICE-SIN:S1A-036#160:1:B>
We just passed by so we saw her we stopped the car picked her up

<ICE-SIN:S1A-036#161:1:B>
She was so furious she went into the car she made so much noise

<ICE-SIN:S1A-036#162:1:B>
The whole car was so noisy

<ICE-SIN:S1A-036#163:1:B>
Ya and then that driver was so cute

<ICE-SIN:S1A-036#164:1:B>
The driver is very chatty you see

<ICE-SIN:S1A-036#165:1:B>
She kept asking her uh Jo uh I'm uh don't know I can't remember
how he introduced himself by another curt way you see

<ICE-SIN:S1A-036#166:1:B>
Then after that Jo ignored him you know

<ICE-SIN:S1A-036#188:1:B>
No I didn't notice your shoes

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-036#189:1:B>
Last Sunday was my company's twenty-fifth anniversary

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-036#190:1:A>
Uhm

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-036#191:1:B>
They had a family day you see

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-036#192:1:A>
Uhm

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-036#193:1:B>
So we had some kind of carnival going

<ICE-SIN:S1A-036#194:1:B>
It was organized by Victor Khoo and company

<ICE-SIN:S1A-036#195:1:B>
So we had all those uh games water games and all sorts of stage
games ya

<ICE-SIN:S1A-036#196:1:B>
They gave us some uh door gifts you know include the towel and
some cleanser thing

<ICE-SIN:S1A-036#197:1:B>
I kept the whole thing in the cupboard

<ICE-SIN:S1A-036#198:1:B>
I don't know whether if I remember next time I remember the
cleanser I take it out whether it'll still be okay

<ICE-SIN:S1A-036#199:1:B>
I didn't want to take out because if I take it out the thing will
it will lost the shape you see <unclear> word </unclear> : It's nice

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-036#200:1:B>
The towel was very nice

<ICE-SIN:S1A-036#201:1:B>
It has got such things you know

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-036#202:1:C>
And they actually managed to print it in the same logo uh
with the the <unclear> word </unclear> and the heart there right

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-036#203:1:B>
Ah ya

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-036#204:1:C>
Uhm

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-036#205:1:B>
I think so

<ICE-SIN:S1A-036#206:1:B>
I think it's not easy you know

<ICE-SIN:S1A-036#207:1:B>
It's probably through contact lah

<ICE-SIN:S1A-036#208:1:B>
Probably they have contacts

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-036#209:1:C>
Uhm

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-036#210:1:B>
Get it at cost price

<ICE-SIN:S1A-036#211:1:B>
'Cos this Lee Peng asked them how much it cost

<ICE-SIN:S1A-036#212:1:B>
Then Jo said how can you ask that kind of thing

<ICE-SIN:S1A-036#213:1:B>
Then Lily said oh I got it at cost price

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-036#214:1:C>
It's quite crowded here <unclear> word </unclear>

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-036#215:1:B>
But it's so far

Actually what is the main reason for you to

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-036#262:1:B>
Oh the main reason is my boss lah

<ICE-SIN:S1A-036#263:1:B>
Ya because last time I was quite comfortable you see whatever job
she gave me even things that you know she was too busy to do

<ICE-SIN:S1A-036#264:1:B>
I mean she didn't want to do she just gave it to me taxation the
whole group's taxation <unclear> word </unclear> you see

<ICE-SIN:S1A-036#265:1:B>
It's now by the taxation bank just check feedback in instruction
to carry on uh

<ICE-SIN:S1A-036#266:1:B>
I did <unclear> word </unclear> reports

<ICE-SIN:S1A-036#267:1:B>
At the time I <unclear> word </unclear> my my boss already did not
give me a lot of work that without inform me about the kind of work she is
doing

<ICE-SIN:S1A-036#268:1:B>
There the work that she should coach me while <unclear> word
</unclear> <X>

<ICE-SIN:S1A-036#X269:1:B>
Right from the beginning I was <unclear> word </unclear>
assisting meaning when whenever she's not around I have to do what she is
doing

<ICE-SIN:S1A-036#X270:1:B>
But she's never prepared me she's never informed me or never done
anything to inform me of what she's doing and ya so I I mean I was quite
happy because I was very busy

<ICE-SIN:S1A-036#X271:1:B>
I didn't want to take on whatever lah

<ICE-SIN:S1A-036#X272:1:B>
Then when we put in the <unclear> word </unclear> report in last
year I was quite busy so I said I I believe at that time I started having
<unclear> word </unclear> because of <unclear> word </unclear>

<ICE-SIN:S1A-036#X273:1:B>
But it I was <unclear> word </unclear> because I was doing the
release doing petrol data

<ICE-SIN:S1A-036#X274:1:B>
I was quite unhappy about it lah but I took it as a chance for me
to uhm to get hands-on experience of the system lah so that it'll give me
it'll help me to supervise the staff you see

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-036#X275:1:C>
Uhm

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-036#X276:1:B>
More effectively and then she went on maternity leave

<ICE-SIN:S1A-036#X277:1:B>
Before she went I was so worried you know because I knew that a
lot of work she did I'll never I'll never be able to handle

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-036#X278:1:C>
Uhm

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-036#X279:1:B>
Just worried that there'll be a lot of <unclear> word
</unclear> to do

<ICE-SIN:S1A-036#X280:1:B>
She just went off

<ICE-SIN:S1A-036#X281:1:B>
One week before she went off she started telling me about what
report that she gave but that was <unclear> word </unclear> what you have
been doing for the whole year you know

<ICE-SIN:S1A-036#X282:1:B>
So she went off suddenly because her <unclear> word </unclear>
burst you see

<ICE-SIN:S1A-036#X283:1:B>
Oh then had to open her drawers everyday look through all her
things

<ICE-SIN:S1A-036#X284:1:B>
She's very messy you see her things and find out what's going on

<ICE-SIN:S1A-036#X285:1:B>
There are certain things that she filed very nice very
systematically so she <unclear> word </unclear>

<ICE-SIN:S1A-036#X286:1:B>
Ya but it was terrible I had a very hard time

<ICE-SIN:S1A-036#X287:1:B>
I worked so late and then and then then she after that just
before she went she mentioned a couple of times oh by the time I come back
they probably don't need me any more

<ICE-SIN:S1A-036#X288:1:B>
You can easily do my job

<ICE-SIN:S1A-036#X289:1:B>
That to me I took it very naturally lah that no <unclear> word
</unclear> I mean I don't feel I'll be able to do as good a job as you </X>
</I>
