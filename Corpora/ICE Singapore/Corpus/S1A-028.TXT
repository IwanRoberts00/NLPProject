<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-028#92:1:A>

<ICE-SIN:S1A-028#160:1:B>

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-028#165:1:A>
Uhm so

<ICE-SIN:S1A-028#166:1:A>
Maybe it's

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-028#167:1:B>
It's alright to scratch for me

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-028#168:1:A>
For me it's not what people think uhm

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-028#169:1:B>
Uhm

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-028#170:1:A>

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-028#171:1:B>
Uhm uhm uhm

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-028#172:1:A>
but it's how I like to look at myself you see

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-028#173:1:B>
my own self ya

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-028#174:1:A>
I don't like to see myself as

<ICE-SIN:S1A-028#175:1:A>
Like sometimes you sit at home and then the old habits come up

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-028#176:1:B>
Uh oh dear

<ICE-SIN:S1A-028#177:1:A>

middle of her nose

<ICE-SIN:S1A-028#218:1:B>
You don't see an end to it

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-028#219:1:A>

<ICE-SIN:S1A-028#222:1:B>
That's why it's scary

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-028#223:1:A>
That's right

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-028#224:1:B>
Ya

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-028#225:1:A>
You don't know what the outcome would be

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-028#226:1:B>
Uhm

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-028#227:1:A>
Otherwise if you expect it

<ICE-SIN:S1A-028#228:1:A>
Uh it's not so bad

<ICE-SIN:S1A-028#229:1:A>
It's no good

<ICE-SIN:S1A-028#230:1:A>
I mean you don't feel good but

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-028#231:1:B>

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-028#232:1:A>
But it's not as bad as you know some

<ICE-SIN:S1A-028#233:1:A>
Just like when you're when I was on the air-plane

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-028#234:1:B>
Uhm uhm

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-028#235:1:A>

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-028#236:1:B>
Uh huh ya

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-028#237:1:A>

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-028#241:1:B>
Ah

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-028#242:1:A>
So that was quite frightening because

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-028#243:1:B>
Ah

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-028#244:1:A>

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-028#245:1:B>
Boom ya

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-028#246:1:A>
Explosion then your your ear-drum bursts you know

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-028#247:1:B>

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-028#249:1:B>
Ya

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-028#250:1:A>
But toothache is fine headaches are fine

<$B>

<ICE-SIN:S1A-028#264:1:A>
Uhm headache is I don't know headache is not so bad

<ICE-SIN:S1A-028#265:1:A>
It's just the pain in a certain part of the head

<$B>

<ICE-SIN:S1A-028#271:1:B>
Ya ya but I get that very often

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-028#272:1:A>
Maybe it's migraine

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-028#273:1:B>
Hey but I don't know what it is but a panadol solves it all

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-028#274:1:A>
Should go and see a doctor

<ICE-SIN:S1A-028#275:1:A>
Oh mine came to a point when the panadol didn't solve it

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-028#276:1:B>
Ah

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-028#277:1:A>

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-028#287:1:A>

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-028#288:1:B>
