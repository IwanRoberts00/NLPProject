<h> RESERVIST TRAINING </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2D-006#73:4>
1) In recognition of the contributions of staff members who are
required to undergo reservist training annually as part of their National
Service commitments, the University has proposed that the following course of
action be taken:

<ICE-SIN:W2D-006#74:4>
<h> ( 1) Teaching Workload </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2D-006#75:4>
( a) When staff members are away on reservist training, arrangements
should be made for their teaching duties to be covered by staff members who
are non-reservists, as far as possible.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-006#76:4>
Reservists should only be asked to undertake make-up lectures on
their return if there are insufficient staff in their area of expertise.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-006#77:4>
( b) With reference to the teaching duties of staff members for each
term/year, the overall teaching load of staff members who are reservists may
be reduced to some extent in those cases where their teaching duties cannot
be covered by other staff members during their reservist training.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-006#78:4>
<h> ( 2) Holiday Leave during term-time </h> Flexibility will be
exercised to allow staff members whose reservist training fall during
vacation periods to take leave during term time, subject to exigencies of
service.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-006#79:4>
<h> ( 3) Annual Review for promotion/salary adjustment </h> The
curriculum vitae ( cv) form that staff members have to update each year will
be amended to enable details of any reservist training undertaken in the year
of assessment to be included.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-006#80:4>
This is to facilitate proper records being kept and for the
Establishment Committee to give allowance, where necessary and appropriate,
to any reduced output in research and publications from such staff members.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-006#81:4>
( As the curriculum vitae form for the October/November 1990 Review
has already been sent to staff members, please note that this change will
only be reflected in the cv form for the April/May Review in 1991).

<ICE-SIN:W2D-006#82:4>
2) I should be grateful if Heads of departments would note the above
for appropriate action.

<h> EXTENSION OF PUBLIC OFFICERS GROUP INSURANCE SCHEME TO SPOUSES
</h>

<ICE-SIN:W2D-006#96:5>
The Government has implemented a Group Insurance Scheme at low
premium rates for public officers since 1 September 1988.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-006#97:5>
The Scheme is underwritten by the Insurance Corporation of Singapore
Limited ( ICS).

<ICE-SIN:W2D-006#98:5>
University staff members below the age of 65 are eligible to apply
for participation in the scheme on a voluntary basis.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-006#99:5>
Briefly, the Scheme provides cover against death due to all causes,
total permanent disability arising from accidents and illnesses, and partial
permanent disablement arising from accidents.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-006#100:5>
The premium is 90 cents per month for every insured sum of
&dollar;10,000/- up to a maximum cover of
&dollar;200,000/-. 

<ICE-SIN:W2D-006#101:5>
With effect from l September l99l, the Group Insurance
Scheme will be extended to spouses of eligible staff members of the
University.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-006#102:5>
A staff member who wishes to cover his/her spouse under the Scheme
will have to satisfy the following conditions:-

<ICE-SIN:W2D-006#103:5>
( a) he/she must first be covered under the Scheme;

<ICE-SIN:W2D-006#104:5>
( b) the spouse must be below the age of 65 and

<ICE-SIN:W2D-006#105:5>
( c) the spouse's application is subject to acceptance by the
Insurance Company underwriting the Scheme.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-006#106:5>
Where the spouse who is a public officer is already insured under
the Scheme, he/she is not eligible for additional cover under the Scheme ie a
public officer and his/her spouse may only effect one policy each under the
Scheme.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-006#107:5>
Staff members who wish to cover his/her spouse under the Scheme will
have to complete the Application Form, Salary Deduction Authorisation Form
and Nomination of Beneficiary Form.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-006#108:5>
These forms may be obtained from the Personnel Department.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-006#109:5>
For the insurance coverage to be effective from 1 September 1991,
the necessary forms must be returned to the Personnel Department duly
completed by 13 July 1991.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-006#110:5>
Applications submitted after 13 July 1991 will be effective from a
later date.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-006#111:5>
When an application is accepted, the applicant will be issued with a
Certificate of Insurance and a booklet outlining the benefits of the Scheme.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-006#112:5>
Please draw the attention of eligible staff members to this
circular.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-006#113:5>
