<h> <bold> A step to the Next Lap </bold> </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-009#2:1>

<p> WITH speculation about an early general election in the air recently,
Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong's disclosure last Sunday that it would indeed be
held <quote> way before </quote> the end-1993 deadline has come as no great
surprise to many.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-009#3:1>
Of course, Mr Goh had said after the 1988 poll that he planned to have
the new Parliament sit for the full five-year term, something unprecedented
in Singapore history.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-009#4:1>
The longest Parliament has sat between general elections is four years
and seven months, the shortest just a day short of four years.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-009#5:1>
But conditions change and Mr Goh, and his advisers, obviously feel
that it is unnecessary, perhaps even unwise, to put the polls off till the
mandated expiry of the present Parliament.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-009#6:1>
And, as virtually everyone has noted, the current situation
certainly looks ideal for the ruling People's Action Party - quite
apart from the chronic disarray and unpreparedness of the opposition parties.
</p>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-009#7:1>

<p> The economy is purring along nicely, at a rate that is higher than can be
expected to last for much longer, but not so high that labour shortages
and high wages are squeezing the numerically significant small
employers who might be inclined to take it out on the PAP when they are
hurting.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-009#8:1>
The cost of living, a hot topic not long ago, has lost much of its
bite now that most of the increases in public fees and charges have been
announced and implemented.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-009#9:1>
Similarly the initial unhappiness over the car quota scheme now that
the Government has yielded to public criticism and agreed to try out
non-transferable certificates entitlement for a year.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-009#10:1>
In education, fears over the unaffordability of independent schools
appear to have died down and the clamour for more places for higher education
has been dampened with the announcement that a fourth polytechnic and an open
university are on the way.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-009#11:1>
The government has also deflected somewhat rising medical
costs as an issue by its recent assurances on continued subsidies and Mr
Goh's announcement that he was considering an endowment fund to top up
Medisave accounts of the needy. </p>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-009#12:1>

<p> The mood is sweet over the intangibles too.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-009#13:1>
Malays who were unhappy with the Government at the last election have
been reassured by its demonstrations since of continued support for the
community's aspirations while Indians who were chagrined because they thought
they deserved similar help are presumably pleased by the Government's
support for their newly established self-help organisation, the Singapore
Indian Development Association.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-009#14:1>
The majority Chinese population too has been soothed by an
unprecedented degree of attention to their concerns, especially over language
and culture, and assurances that the government cares as much for the welfare
of the Chinese poor as for minority poor.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-009#15:1>
In nonracial terms, the desire of younger,
English-educated Singaporeans for a more relaxed regimen has been
accommodated by a
liberalisation of film censorship, balanced by promises to older or more
conservative citizens that this can be moderated if that is what they want.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-009#16:1>
<p> In setting himself the full-term target in 1988, Mr Goh spoke of needing
the time to forge a new working relationship with the people of Singapore.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-009#17:1>
It is clear now that, in true PAP style, he had been unduly cautious.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-009#18:1>
Although former Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew remains in the Cabinet
and plays an important role, Mr Goh has succeeded in putting his own
distinctive stamp and, to a lesser extent, agenda, on Singapore in his mere
eight months at the helm.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-009#19:1>
So the election is not merely a question of getting the people's
mandate for the policies of the next few years.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-009#20:1>
It is also to measure public approval of Mr Goh personally, to
confirm that the Cabinet's choice of Mr Goh as Prime Minister is also the
people's choice.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-009#21:1>
That would mark the crossing of another threshold in the political
transition in Singapore, signifying that the nation has truly moved on to the
Next Lap. </p> </I>

<I>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-009#22:2>
<h> <bold> Celebrate the S'pore spirit </bold> </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-009#23:2>

<p> A GREAT little nation: This is certainly an exhilarating vision of
what Singapore could be.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-009#24:2>
But visions can remain vague and dreams can evaporate in the
clamour of the immediate and the urgent.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-009#25:2>
As Singapore turns 26 in a fervour of soul-searching and
introspection, it is a good time to turn people's thoughts to just what this
aspiration might mean.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-009#26:2>
The Next Lap has given substance to this vision but what
Singaporeans can do to spur themselves on is to reflect on and realise what
their country has been about, to understand the spirit that makes Singapore.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-009#27:2>
This spirit is something one could call a Singaporean virtue, virtue
not as in virtuousness, which is smug, but virtue as the hallmark or essence
of what being Singaporean has become.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-009#28:2>
In this critical self-analysis, where does one begin?

<ICE-SIN:W2E-009#29:2>
A good place is the past, for the past is often a beginning to the
future. </p>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-009#30:2>

<p> Twenty-six years ago Singapore was a state founded on the inauspicious
discovery that it was not, after all, to be part of a larger, reassuring
entity; that it was, in the cold-eyed assessment of its founding leaders, a
country not meant to be.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-009#31:2>
Many transformations have since been wrought.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-009#32:2>
The island that feared for its survival is now a city-state,
gleaming, prosperous and renowned for its success.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-009#33:2>
The trading port no larger than a speck on the map is now the hub of
air and sea routes reaching right across the world.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-009#34:2>
Economic prosperity has been achieved through Western science and
technology but within a tightly co-ordinated economic and
socio-political system inspired more by Asian paternalism and Confucian
concepts of social order than Western libertarian ideals.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-009#35:2>
A crowded island that might have turned into a sad cluster of slums
and ghettoes is now a garden city with green lungs and nature reserves.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-009#36:2>
A collection of immigrants, ethnically and culturally diverse
who overnight, almost three decade ago, found themselves citizens of
Singapore, are now earnestly charting a joint destiny.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-009#37:2>
These transformations surely testify to the Singapore spirit, to that
virtue of making positives out of negatives, of turning inhospitable
environments into conditions for success. </p>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-009#38:2>

<p> What is the secret formula - Confucian core values, visionary and
dedicated leaders and a wisely responsive people, Western education and
technology, the sheer grit of people with nothing left to lose or merely the
favour of the gods?

<ICE-SIN:W2E-009#39:2>
Or was it a winning combination of all these?

<ICE-SIN:W2E-009#40:2>
What matters now is not which factors went into the formula or how
much each contributed to it.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-009#41:2>
What matters is that all Singaporeans should grasp and celebrate that
virtue that makes strength out of vulnerability, and take pride in being
people who will work to turn adversity into good fortune.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-009#42:2>
Then will Singapore continue to stake out paths and possibilities few
others venture on.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-009#43:2>
The challenges of the future beckon: A state forged under a
heavy authoritarian hand must now develop, without trauma and mishaps along
the way, into a nation of confident, self-motivated individuals; a society
that needs to remain fiercely competitive must yet feel a caring generosity
for those handicapped for the race or who fall by the wayside; a people
beginning to weary of the constant effort to excel must steel themselves for
yet more striving; a younger generation must be allowed to grow up innovative
and independent and yet keep united in purpose; a country poised precariously
at the confluence of East and West, of old and new must find its own
equilibrium; a people who see the world as their marketplace must remain
anchored in the regional fold, and a people whose horizons span the world,
who travel, work and live in lands across the seas must call Singapore home.
</p>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-009#44:2>
<p> A nation not meant to be, but a people who thrived in achieving near
impossibles can surely strive yet again to become one of the more
remarkable communities on the Pacific Rim. </p> </I>

<I>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-009#45:3>
<h> <bold> People-bonding the way ahead </bold> </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-009#46:3>
<p> IN the nine months since he became Prime Minister, Mr Goh Chok Tong
has brought about a participatory style of government which
Singaporeans, accustomed to years of firm, paternalistic rule under Mr Lee Kuan Yew,
found liberating and refreshing.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-009#47:3>
The new Prime Minister's open and consultative style has gone down
well with many Singaporeans who see in him a leader who is not only willing
to listen but also has empathy for the concerns of the common man.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-009#48:3>
This impression was clearly reinforced by his well-received
performance in his maiden National Day Rally address.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-009#49:3>
But it is hardly style alone that distinguishes Mr Goh.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-009#50:3>
The underlying theme in his approach to governance has been a strong
desire to instil in Singaporeans a sense of oneness and of sharing a common
destiny.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-009#51:3>
This philosophy is founded on the premise that unity - in his words,
people-bonding - is essential to Singapore's continued existence and
well-being, a point Mr Goh made very clear in both his eve of National Day
message and National Day Rally address. </p>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-009#52:3>
<p> Hence the emphasis on the need for Singaporeans to consider
themselves as part of an extended family of sorts, with the able being
urged to lend the less-able a helping hand.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-009#53:3>
It is unquestionably a sound approach.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-009#54:3>
For it is through the fostering of such a spirit of mutual support
that negative feelings of envy can be ameliorated somewhat.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-009#55:3>
As Mr Goh noted correctly, there are nascent demonstrations of
jealousy among the not-so-successful which must be nipped in the bud if
Singapore is not to go the way of the communist countries.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-009#56:3>
While meritocracy has been, and will always be, the guiding principle
of Singapore society, there is no under-estimating the importance of
those who have made it being seen to be sparing a thought for and helping
those who have not and those who are not likely to.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-009#57:3>
In so doing, they help to foster a feeling of togetherness. </p>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-009#58:3>
<p> The major policy initiatives Mr Goh has taken since assuming office -
Edusave, Medifund and housing - have all been geared towards making all
Singaporeans feel that they not only expected to do their part for the
country but that their country can do something for them in return.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-009#59:3>
The message he has been sending seems to be: Support the government
and the government will support you in return.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-009#60:3>
As a social contract, this has been widely accepted as a fair deal.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-009#61:3>
Mr Goh's initiatives are not handouts in the socialist tradition;
neither do people expect the policies to have the equalising effects of
centrally-planned economies which have proved to be so disastrous.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-009#62:3>
What is significant, however, is that Singaporeans are now
experiencing the effects of a new leadership which has adapted itself
to the evolving needs of the population.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-009#63:3>
And they seem to be largely appreciative of the changes thus wrought.
</p>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-009#64:3>
<p> For the better part of Singapore's modern political history, the
running of the country has been in the hands of a small core group of people
who called the shots.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-009#65:3>
Decisions taken were largely handed down.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-009#66:3>
It was democracy by will.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-009#67:3>
The hallmark of the Goh administration has been to open the doors
slightly to the decision-making process.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-009#68:3>
Policies are now debated openly and clearly this change is
necessitated by the new demands of an electorate made up of younger and
better-educated Singaporeans who are questioning the tight rule which might
have been appropriate and necessary, in the past.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-009#69:3>
Singaporeans have over the past nine months had a fair measure of the
kind of government they can expect under Mr Goh.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-009#70:3>
And indications are that they are largely in favour of his open-style
government which is more in tune with the times.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-009#71:3>
If that is the case, there can only be one logical response to Mr
Goh's call for a solid mandate for him to carry his policies further.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-009#72:3>
Say " yes" to him and give him a fresh mandate to do things for
Singaporeans his way when the time comes. </p> </I>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-009#73:4>
<h> <bold> Obligations of the able </bold> </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-009#74:4>
THE Prime Minister in speaking of the growing gap between the able
and affluent and the less able and less well-off has touched on a source of
potential conflict within Singapore society. <X>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-009#X75:4>
The less able show signs of resentment and envy while the able and
affluent are self-centred and uncaring of others' needs.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-009#X76:4>
It is a growing trend and an unhealthy gap, whose root causes are
many.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-009#X77:4>
Some suggest that education is to blame.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-009#X78:4>
Educationist will think it is a system too openly appreciative of
talent that tolerates, or worse, creates the kind of education that
distinguishes too starkly between the able and the average or slow learner.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-009#X79:4>
Still others philosophically see it as the innate self-centredness
of human beings that is blind to the needs and feelings of others and,
especially, of those unlike their kind.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-009#X80:4>
One of the Government's early strategies in nation-building was to
scour the island for talent to develop to staff the leadership positions in
every field.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-009#X81:4>
This was the right move as it quickly channelled much-needed talent
to the civil service to run the country.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-009#X82:4>
In those days, government scholarships and other forms of financial
aid went almost exclusively to children from really poor families who might
have been deprived of an education and a chance in life otherwise.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-009#X83:4>
The top scholars and a host of other able people who were helped in
one way or another to rise through the system naturally carried with them a
sense of indebtedness to a society which thus lifted them up from their
humble beginnings.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-009#X84:4>
Their rise also benefited the country; in fact, it created the
efficient leadership that pushed the country fast forward to prosperity.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-009#X85:4>
Meanwhile, Singaporeans became largely middle-class and the numbers
of the really poor dwindled.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-009#X86:4>
The first levelling up had begun.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-009#X87:4>
But after each levelling up must come a time of pushing the more
able in the next generation upward so that they can be the leaders who will
next take the country forward.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-009#X88:4>
When the benefits of more progress permeate down and the whole
country is better off yet again, another levelling up is achieved.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-009#X89:4>
But this is an Olympian view of society's progress not naturally
accepted by the less privileged masses confronted daily with the
conspicuously lavish lifestyles of the well-off.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-009#X90:4>
Much as we dislike the fact, while ideals can be egalitarian, people
are not made equal.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-009#X91:4>
But acceptance of inequality demands a rationality and objectivity
that goes against the human grain.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-009#X92:4>
It is in the nature of society to be hierarchical.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-009#X93:4>
In the meantime, the second generation of able people do not feel
the same sense of indebtedness simply because they needed less help from the
state, their families being better off than the early recipients of state
assistance.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-009#X94:4>
Other factors are at work too.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-009#X95:4>
Material well-being has a special seductiveness that can deny all
other claims and blind those enthralled to all other values.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-009#X96:4>
The yuppie in single-minded pursuit of monetary success and social
recognition does not see beyond himself.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-009#X97:4>
This is not a peculiarly Singaporean problem.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-009#X98:4>
In every society the haves are envied and resented by the have-nots.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-009#X99:4>
What is different about Singapore is that it has the resources - of
experience in successful social engineering, of communication between the
government and the people, of sufficient funds for education and other social
services, of small size and hence cohesiveness, to name only the most obvious
- to tackle the problem.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-009#X100:4>
The meritocracy in Singapore, orderly, transparent and open, is
alive and well.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-009#X101:4>
But for it to endure and ensure the nation's continued economic
progress, it will need those who are able and successful to constantly care
and help the less well-endowed in their midst.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-009#X102:4>
If this is not seen to be done, the less well-endowed who are the
natural majority can endanger the political stability crucial to national
well-being.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-009#X103:4>
This is something the able and successful ignore at their own
peril. </X> </I>
