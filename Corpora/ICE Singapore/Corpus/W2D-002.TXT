<ICE-SIN:W2D-002#138:7>
 <h> HOSPITALISATION, SURGICAL AND MATERNITY INSURANCE SCHEME </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2D-002#139:7>
 1) I am pleased to inform staff that the Hospitalisation, Surgical
and Maternity Insurance Scheme underwritten by the Netherlands Insurance
Company will be renewed for another year from 1 January 1993, details of
which are indicated below.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-002#140:7>
 2) I should be grateful if Heads would draw this circular to the
attention of all staff in the Department.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-002#141:7>
 Staff can submit Photocopied application form at Appendix ( C).

<ICE-SIN:W2D-002#142:7>
 3) This Scheme, once signed on, becomes an automatic renewal scheme,
whereby annual premiums will be automatically deducted from the staff's
salary in January of each year and the staff covered for the duration of that
year, until the staff decides and inform the Personnel Department, in writing
in December of each year to discontinue from coverage by the scheme for the
following year or the staff leaves University service, whichever is earlier.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-002#143:7>
 The staff himself cannot prematurely terminate his policy before the
end of the year.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-002#144:7>
 4) The Scheme is designed to top up existing hospitalisation
benefits provided under the University's Medical Services Scheme.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-002#145:7>
 In this connection, the medical insurance scheme seeks to cover
hospitalisation expenses, otherwise not payable under the University's
Medical Services Scheme, as follows.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-002#146:7>
 ( a) Staff members' share of the ward charges ( 20%) and that of
dependants' share ( 50%) up to SGH Pte Ltd rates ( as at 31 December 1992).

<ICE-SIN:W2D-002#147:7>
 As NUH Pte Ltd and private hospitals charge more than SGH, staff
will still have to bear a portion of the charges.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-002#148:7>
 ( b) In regard to hospitalisation surgical treatment expenses in a
private hospital, the difference between private hospital and SGH Pte Ltd
rates will be payable subject to the limits spelt out in the Government
Private Hospitals Plan.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-002#149:7>
 ( c) Accouchement fees not payable under the University's Medical
Services Scheme will be claimable under the Maternity Benefits Cover, in
addition to ward charges.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-002#150:7>
 Benefits under this Cover will be extended to include reimbursement
of pre-natal and postnatal consultation fees ( excluding medications etc) in
excess of University subsidy, the limits being the savings from the unused
portion of the limits under " DELIVERY FEES" in the Medical Benefits Plan Med
02/93.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-002#151:7>
 Staff not under the Maternity Benefits Cover cannot claim for ward
charges incurred on confinement.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-002#152:7>
 ( d) The scheme also provides coverage to dependants who will be
automatically excluded from the University's Medical Services Scheme, upon
reaching the age of 18.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-002#153:7>
 Coverage in this connection will be granted to dependant unmarried
children from the age of 18 right up to 25 years, provided they can be
certified to be full-time students.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-002#154:7>
 ( e) As an added benefit, the medical insurance scheme is applicable
on a world-wide basis.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-002#155:7>
 The University's Medical Services Scheme on the other hand is
confined to Singapore only.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-002#156:7>
 ( f) Benefits normally not covered by the University's Medical
Services Scheme such as cosmetic surgery or restricted medical benefits will
likewise not be covered by this insurance scheme.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-002#157:7>
 5) Your attention however is drawn to the list of exclusion clauses
spelt out in Paper Med 03193, that are applicable to the scheme.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-002#158:7>
 6) The insurance scheme is an optional one and staff members would
have to pay the premium if they decide to join the scheme.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-002#159:7>
 This is an automatic renewal scheme and a one-time deduction of the
annual premium will be made from salaries in January of each year for
coverage for that year as indicated in paragraph ( 3) above.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-002#160:7>
 7) Coverage will cease when a staff member leaves the services of
the University and a pro-rata refund of the premium will be made accordingly.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-002#161:7>
 8) All claims are to be made on prescribed forms obtainable from the
Personnel Department, and are to be sent direct to the Netherlands Insurance
Company by the staff member himself.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-002#162:7>
 Any disputes over claims with the insurance company will have to be
resolved by the staff member himself and the University will not be involved
in any way.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-002#163:7>
 9) Staff who are interested in the scheme should complete the
application form at Appendix ( C) and return it to me by 31 December 1992.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-002#164:7>
 Late applications will not be accepted.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-002#165:7>
 Coverage will take effect from 1 January 1993.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-002#166:7>
 10) You may contact Miss Christie Yeo, and Miss Cindy Ang,
Marketing/Servicing Section or Mdm Rosalind Phuan, Health Manager of the
Netherlands Insurance Company at tel no: 5323034 should you need any
clarification on the Scheme. <X>
