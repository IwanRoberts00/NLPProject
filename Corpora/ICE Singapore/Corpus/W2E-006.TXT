<h> <bold> SES: More teeth and openness </bold> </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-006#2:1>
<p> FINANCE Minister Richard Hu last Friday cleared the air over several
issues thrown up by the problems at United Industrial Corporation which had
led to much unhealthy speculation about insider trading and debate on fitting
punishments for companies which do not live up to their disclosure
obligations.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-006#3:1>
Speaking in Parliament, he gave Singaporeans a lesson on what
constitutes an insider trading offence, reiterating a point he had made
earlier in a letter to Nominated MP Maurice Choo.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-006#4:1>
There is no evidence of insider trading against UlC's former
controlling shareholder, Mr Oei Hong Leong, and the executive chairman, Mr
Lee Kim Yew.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-006#5:1>
The laws here turn on whether the parties to a transaction have equal
information about the deal.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-006#6:1>
Indonesian tycoon Liem Sioe Liong knew about UlC's losses before he
bought the shares.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-006#7:1>
Neither buyer nor seller were disadvantaged, and insider trading
allegations could not be sustained.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-006#8:1>
The Monetary Authority of Singapore regularly evaluates many possible
violations of the Securities Industrial Act and where there is <foreign>
<it> prima facie </it> </foreign> evidence of wrong-doing they are sent to
the Attorney General or the Commercial Affairs Department for
investigation and prosecution.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-006#9:1>
The facts of UIC's case show that no insider trading offence under the
Act was committed. </p>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-006#10:1>
<p> However, on whether public censure is enough for companies which do not
honour their undertakings to the Stock Exchange of Singapore, Dr Hu
conceded that the SES might need tougher sanctions.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-006#11:1>
Currently, besides censure - seen by many as a mere tap on the wrist
- it could suspend a company's shares or delist them.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-006#12:1>
But as the Minister pointed out, these are extreme measures and are
likely to hurt ordinary shareholders more than those responsible for a
company's misconduct.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-006#13:1>
The two extremes of penalties now available must reduce both the SES'
flexibility and subtlety when dealing with recalcitrants.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-006#14:1>
Since Parliament has given it the encouragement, the exchange should
seize the opportunity to review what weapons would be more responsive
to situations arising from an increasingly sophisticated market.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-006#15:1>
To discharge its regulatory responsibilities better, it might
have to acquire equipment for precision bombing, which in the corporate
world could mean removal of the board, denial of market access or forbidding
trading in the shares owned by the culprits for a specific period.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-006#16:1>
The pain would then hit closer to home. </p>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-006#17:1>
<p> Apart from a lack of suitable weapons to punish those who disobey, the
SES has been shown by the UIC affair to lack also the sort of openness that
is increasingly demanded in today's more open and consultative climate.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-006#18:1>
Complaints centre especially on its rejection of rights or bonus
issues without explanation.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-006#19:1>
This cannot last and Dr Hu has advised a change of heart.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-006#20:1>
The SES appears ready to do this, although it still wants to reserve
the right not to explain, in exceptional circumstances. </p>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-006#21:1>
<p> For the sake of its credibility, the exchange should make those
circumstances extremely rare.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-006#22:1>
The market will allow the SES the discretion of silence only if it is
convinced that when the regulators keep quiet, it is genuinely in the
public interest - not because they are unable to justify their actions by
reference to the rule-book.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-006#23:1>
The SES must accept that a well-regulated market is one where not
only are its rules obeyed, but one where the rules are also well-known.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-006#24:1>
Its view is that they already are.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-006#25:1>
Even so, more good than harm will come from reiterating them at every
opportunity, since every exposition will reduce the number of those who can
claim ignorance in defence should they offend.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-006#26:1>
As for those clamouring to know why they do not meet the exchange's
exacting standards, they must not turn squeamish if the SES tells all.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-006#27:1>
Those who ask for more openness must expect that some candid truths
hurt and not necessarily those who tell them.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-006#28:1>
The SES has been primed for more openness and tougher action.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-006#29:1>
Hopefully the market is ready for them. </p> </I>

<h> <bold> Banking on ethics </bold> </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-006#31:2>
<p> IS SINGAPORE'S financial sector over-regulated or could it do with having
more loopholes plugged to remove any residual temptation there might be for
the cavalier-minded?

<ICE-SIN:W2E-006#32:2>
How this question is handled depends on whether the response is from
those at the receiving end or from the side dishing it out.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-006#33:2>
Whatever the answer is, there is no denying the benefits that have
accrued to Singapore as a result of a regulatory framework that does not
compromise on sound prudent standards.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-006#34:2>
Consequently, the country is able to boast of never having
suffered one single bank failure since independence - a remarkable
record, considering the number of bank collapses that many developing and
developed countries have had to endure in the past 25 years.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-006#35:2>
And despite the volatility and excesses that accompanied the
global move to deregulate the international financial system,
Singapore not only managed to come through the past decade unscathed but also
enjoyed the underpinning of a financial sector that grew at twice the
rate of what was already a high growth economy. </p>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-006#36:2>
<p> However, while a comprehensive set of laws may keep the sector strong and
the crooked sidelined, it may not be fine-honed enough to deal with
those who abide by the letter but blatantly snub the spirit of the rules.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-006#37:2>
That there are people of such malleable ethics is reflected in the
alarming jump in the number of written complaints which the Monetary
Authority of Singapore has received against financial institutions.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-006#38:2>
In the first 5 1/2 months of this year, the number was just three
short of the total for the whole of last year.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-006#39:2>
Most are venal, not criminal.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-006#40:2>
But rather than wait for the situation to deteriorate and discipline
to be imposed externally, the Association of Banks in Singapore has seized
the initiative - probably with the MAS' encouragement - to enforce order.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-006#41:2>
A code of conduct that seeks to define the parameters of fair
bank-customer relationship and ethical standards of conduct for bank
staff has been drawn up for consideration by the newly-elected council of the
ABS which meets tomorrow.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-006#42:2>
While no penalties for breaching the code will be laid down, the ABS
looks to exerting moral pressure to bring member banks into line. </p>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-006#43:2>
<p> The ABS move is a welcome change from the blinkered approach of the
securities industry back in the 1980s when it steadfastly refused either to
recognise the dangers posed by its shortcomings or to reform, despite much
prompting from the authorities.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-006#44:2>
What followed belongs to the annals of Singapore's financial sector.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-006#45:2>
The unethical - and illegal - excesses culminated in the Pan Electric
Industries debacle, which forced the regulators to step in to restore order,
taking away much of the industry's self-regulating independence. </p>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-006#46:2>
<p> Hopefully, the bankers' move to put their house in order heralds a new
era where businesses will want increasingly to be responsible for policing
their own activities and delineating what is, and what is not, the acceptable
face of capitalism.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-006#47:2>
However, for such self-regulation to work, business leaders
will need to have high moral authority.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-006#48:2>
That they can achieve only if they demand an impeccable standard of
ethics of themselves and refuse to tolerate anything less from their peers.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-006#49:2>
But when the Stock Exchange of Singapore had to intervene even in
issues where the expected conduct is quite obvious - for instance, the SES
had to stop some major shareholders from allotting themselves giant portions
of shares at preferential prices in executive stock option schemes - the time
may not be ripe yet for regulators to undo their gloves and look on the
private sector as partners.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-006#50:2>
They can relax only when Singapore's financial community proves
itself beyond doubt to have ethics that can be banked on.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-006#51:2>
Any premature relaxation could court the massive business
failures and frauds which huge countries can shrug off with little dent to
their credibility but not tiny Singapore which relies on its vaunted
integrity to keep the investors coming in, especially the foreign ones.

<h> <bold> Invaluable lessons </bold> </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-006#53:3>
<p> IF anyone here thought it was through sheer good luck that the collapsed
Bank of Credit and Commerce International had no operations in
Singapore, he was not allowed to retain that illusion for long.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-006#54:3>
The Monetary Authority of Singapore issued a statement last weekend
revealing that BCCI had in fact made not one but three formal applications
over a 10-year span between 1973 and 1982 for a licence to operate here.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-006#55:3>
After that, it also met MAS officials on several occasions to plead
its case, but to no avail.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-006#56:3>
The bank, like the defunct National Bank of Brunei, could not meet
MAS' admission criteria and Singapore once again avoided the kind of
disruption to its banking system now causing severe problems to 69
countries where the failed BCCI had operations. </p>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-006#57:3>
<p> There are invaluable lessons from this episode, one of which is the
crucial role played by vigilant regulators who are not dazzled or intimidated
by well-known names or high-powered connections when it comes to deciding who
should be allowed to do business in a country.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-006#58:3>
Until convicted and fined for drug-money laundering in the United
States last year, BCCI appeared to have impressive enough credentials,
including the ruler of Abu Dhabi as its 77 per cent owner.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-006#59:3>
Considering oil money's power of persuasion in the early 1970s when
most countries jockeyed for a share in recycling petrodollars, MAS'
refusal reflected both stringency and street-smartness of a kind not always
evident in banking regulators.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-006#60:3>
It also showed a keen appreciation of the whispers circulating
for years about that bank on the international financial grapevine,
although hard proof was not found until late last month when the Bank of
England got the whole sorry story from BCCI's auditors.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-006#61:3>
Losses had been systematically concealed for many years by
using virtually every accounting trick in the book.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-006#62:3>
The lesson from this is that there are times when regulators may have
to act on well-founded suspicion alone, for by the time the dirty linen is
uncovered, it may well be too late.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-006#63:3>
Critics are now arguing that regulators in countries where BCCI had
operations should have acted far sooner instead of waiting for proof. </p>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-006#64:3>
<p> After the event, it is easy to see the sandy foundation on which the BCCI
empire was built.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-006#65:3>
Its main operations were based in Luxembourg and the Cayman Islands,
two financial centres with no central bank and only limited regulatory
capacity.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-006#66:3>
It also meant that BCCI had no lender of last resort other than its
Arab controlling shareholder.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-006#67:3>
However, if protection of innocent depositors is to have any meaning,
the important thing is for guardians to grasp the implications before the
denouement, not after.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-006#68:3>
The worst dereliction is when regulators hesitate to act for
fear of precipitating a collapse.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-006#69:3>
This seems to have been what happened in Hongkong.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-006#70:3>
After Britain and other countries had acted against BCCI,
regulators in the colony continued to make soothing noises, only to do an
about-turn a few days later. </p>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-006#71:3>
<p> One further lesson from BCCI is the danger countries court by allowing
foreign bank branches to proliferate within their frontiers, when they do not
have the means or the jurisdiction to follow such banks' activities globally.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-006#72:3>
The 120,000 small individual depositors in Britain who lost their
money through BCCI's 25 branches are learning to their cost the danger of
banking with a foreign bank.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-006#73:3>
However, the political cost to the ruling Conservative Party could be
far higher, as depositors will blame their government - which gave BCCI
a licence - for their loss, rather than their greed for high-yielding
facilities.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-006#74:3>
To be sure, even an offshore branch fraudulently managed could do
much harm but certainly much less than if a whole network were allowed to
operate on par with domestic banks.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-006#75:3>
The point is that regulators are not there to guarantee against bank
failures but to provide a system of checks to make them highly unlikely, and
to limit the damage if the unlikely should happen.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-006#76:3>
That is what MAS has been doing. </p> </I>
<I>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-006#77:4>
<h> <bold> Self-rule needs high integrity </bold> </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-006#78:4>
<p> IS A Code of Conduct, now being studied by members of the Association of
Banks in Singapore, necessary for banks operating here? <X>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-006#X79:4>
It will come on top of the Banking Act, the Securities Industry Act
and the Companies Act besides the various rules and regulations imposed by
the Monetary Authority of Singapore and the Stock Exchange of Singapore on
listed companies and stockbroking firms.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-006#X80:4>
Local banks are already listed directly or indirectly on the SES,
while those with stockbroking arms have further to knuckle down to SES and
MAS discipline like any member firm.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-006#X81:4>
The existence of such multi-layered and multi-pronged supervision
together with various laws suggest that there are already enough safeguards
to cover any conceivable loophole for banks and their staff to misbehave.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-006#X82:4>
It adds up to a persuasive case against having any more rules,
especially in light of the present climate where they are perceived as
stifling creative flair or entrepreneurial spirit.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-006#X83:4>
Yet like most persuasive arguments, it is speciously flawed. </p>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-006#X84:4>
<p> The existence of laws has not put the courts or jails out of business.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-006#X85:4>
And the existence of comprehensive companies and securities
legislation and formal guidelines may not keep the financial system
consistently scandal-free either, if there is no strong commitment to
fostering increasingly higher standards of professionalism and integrity
among practitioners in the industry.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-006#X86:4>
The draft code will bring what are in the statute books right into
the dealing room or the banking hall by putting together a set of do's and
don'ts for bank officers, from abuse of position, to misuse of information
and conflict of interests.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-006#X87:4>
Such a code is particularly useful here where foreign banks owing no
allegiance, for example, to the SES which provides one of the many safeguards
- dominate the industry.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-006#X88:4>
Their cultures and values may not always be consonant with the high
standards insisted upon here and the code would serve as a constant reminder
to them of this. </p>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-006#X89:4>
<p> The trouble with the ABS code, however, is that it lacks the power of
sanction.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-006#X90:4>
While it can preach and teach, it cannot impeach.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-006#X91:4>
It is very much up to members' good sense and integrity whether the
code will become their bible or another theoretical tract.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-006#X92:4>
The code also does not appear to distinguish between the seriousness
of practices that run foul of the law, like insider trading or share price
manipulation, and those that may be merely unfair, like not telling a
customer what his effective charges or the potential risks may be.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-006#X93:4>
And while it is not possible to provide for every contingency -
leaving no room for any creative ethical equivocation by practitioners - the
code appears not to have fully addressed the issue of proper business
conduct.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-006#X94:4>
Instead, it has enumerated what is standard market practice.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-006#X95:4>
Now when ABS cannot even get members to toe the line in quoting
effective interest rates a recommendation made last year without the full
weight of MAS backing - can bank customers be sanguine that the more
comprehensive code will not be compromised, when pressure to build up market
share and improve bottom-line performance rises? </p>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-006#X96:4>
<p> The hope lies in enough bankers holding dear the principle of
self-discilpline.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-006#X97:4>
Then they will respond to the challenge to keep their own house in
order with an integrity and commitment to standards to match those exhibited
by MAS.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-006#X98:4>
They will make the effort to obey the code, both in letter and in
law, an adherence which the draft enjoins.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-006#X99:4>
If that happens, MAS will surely be the happier for it, because
market discipline has an important role in creating a safe and sound banking
system to meet customers' evolving needs - a role for which, as regulators,
MAS is no substitute.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-006#X100:4>
The scandal-racked Tokyo financial markets where a collapse of
confidence underlines the damage caused by low standards and lack of
integrity must surely help convince bankers here that high standards and
integrity pay in the long term. </p> </I> </X>
