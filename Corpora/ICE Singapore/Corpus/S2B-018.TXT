Good evening

<ICE-SIN:S2B-018#3:1:A>
Public sector employees can look forward to receiving three months
bonus this year

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S2B-018#4:1:B>
The Port of Singapore Authority will invest more than nine
hundred million dollars in its container terminals in the next few years

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S2B-018#5:1:A>
Public sector employees can look forward to receiving three
months bonus this year

<ICE-SIN:S2B-018#6:1:A>
It's similar to the amount given last year

<ICE-SIN:S2B-018#7:1:A>
This includes the one month non-pensionable annual allowance at the
end of the year

<ICE-SIN:S2B-018#8:1:A>
A statement from the Finance Ministry says there'll be no increase
in bonus payments because of the projected lower growth of four to six
percent this year It says the variable bonus of two months salary will be
paid in two parts

<ICE-SIN:S2B-018#9:1:A>
The first part amounting to three quarter month salary based on this
month's pay will be given next month The remaining one and one quarter month
will be paid in December if the economy performs as expected

<ICE-SIN:S2B-018#10:1:A>
But if the economy performs better than expected by the end of the
year the government will consider paying a special bonus

<ICE-SIN:S2B-018#11:1:A>
The statement says the annual wage commence from a zero point five
percentage point increase in employers' CPF amounts to a three point seven
percent increase in public sector pay

<ICE-SIN:S2B-018#12:1:A>
It's lower than the four point nine percent increase last year

<ICE-SIN:S2B-018#13:1:A>
This conforms to the National Wages Council's recommendation that
wage increase for this year should be moderated in line with the expected
slower economic growth

<ICE-SIN:S2B-018#14:1:A>
The NTUC welcomes the government's bonus decision but the Singapore
Federation of Chambers of Commerce and Industry the SFCCI is concerned that
the announcement will be used to press private sector employers for a
corresponding figure

<ICE-SIN:S2B-018#15:1:A>
It says this would be without regard to the company's profitability

<ICE-SIN:S2B-018#16:1:A>
The SFCCI said bonuses should be tied to productivity and the
company's profit position

<ICE-SIN:S2B-018#17:1:A>
These are contained in the recent NWC Guidelines which it supports

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S2B-018#18:1:B>
The Port of Singapore Authority will spend nine hundred and
twenty million dollars to expand its container terminals to meet increased
shipping traffic in the next few years

<ICE-SIN:S2B-018#19:1:B>
Communications Minister Mr Mah Bow Tan announced this at the launch
of the new facilities at Maritime Square

<ICE-SIN:S2B-018#20:1:B>
He said container shipping grew by twenty two percent in just the
first five months of this year

<ICE-SIN:S2B-018#21:1:B>
The terminal expansion will accommodate increases of many millions
of Twenty-foot

<ICE-SIN:S2B-018#22:1:B>
Equipment Container Units or TEUs moved into and out of the Port
each year

<ICE-SIN:S2B-018#23:1:B>
He said the Port's a major contributor to the economy and must
strive to remain so by planning to meet its customers' needs

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S2B-018#24:1:A>
Five hundred million dollars will be spent to expand Tanjong
Pagar and Keppel terminal

<ICE-SIN:S2B-018#25:1:A>
Another four hundred and twenty million dollars will be spent on
the Brani terminal bringing development costs there to one thousand four
hundred million dollars

<ICE-SIN:S2B-018#26:1:A>
Mr Mah said the investments will make it possible for Keppel
Harbour to handle over twelve million TEUs a year

<ICE-SIN:S2B-018#27:1:A>
It'll enable Singapore to cope with the container traffic till the
new terminal at Pasir Panjang is ready

<ICE-SIN:S2B-018#28:1:A>
The re-developments of the World Trade Centre cost one hundred and
sixty six million dollars and took over two and a half years to complete

<ICE-SIN:S2B-018#29:1:A>
PSA says this is aimed at turning the area into a maritime business
and leisure centre

<ICE-SIN:S2B-018#30:1:A>
This is to forge greater links with the community which has
contributed to the Port's success

<ICE-SIN:S2B-018#31:1:A>
A sheltered walkway links the World Trade Centre building to the
new Expo Gateway

<ICE-SIN:S2B-018#32:1:A>
PSA hopes that with pedestrians using the walkway the road would be
clear for a better flow of taxis

<ICE-SIN:S2B-018#35:1:A>

Shops at the Harbour Promenade and the Singapore Cruise Centre are
said to cater for the big number of visitors

<ICE-SIN:S2B-018#37:1:A>
Nine million people are expected this year These include passengers
using the Cruise Centre for international and regional cruises

<ICE-SIN:S2B-018#38:1:A>
A Maritime showcase will complete the new look

<ICE-SIN:S2B-018#39:1:A>

<ICE-SIN:S2B-018#48:1:A>
The latest ceasefire has shattered and street battles have erupted

plan to re-open Sarajevo airport for relief flight

<ICE-SIN:S2B-018#50:1:A>

Sarajevo within <unclear> word </unclear> perimeter and turn the tide of the
war

Japan as a possible permanent member of the Security Council

<ICE-SIN:S2B-018#59:1:A>
The Minister for Information and the Arts said it will depend on
Japan being accepted as a trusted member of a larger East Asian community

<ICE-SIN:S2B-018#60:1:A>
Brigadier-General George Yeo speaking at a seminar organized by GG
Press Limited a Japanese organization whose members include Japanese
executives living in Singapore

<ICE-SIN:S2B-018#61:1:A>
General Yeo said while East Asia finds it hard to accept a
militarily powerful Japan it's more ready to accept a politically influential
Japan within the framework of the United Nations

<ICE-SIN:S2B-018#62:1:A>
He said an East Asian consciousness once submerged by Japanese
imperialism and the Cold War is re-emerging and it's in Japan's interest to
help develop it
