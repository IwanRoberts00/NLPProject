<h> THE CORALS OF THE FAMILY AGARICIDAE </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-022#2:1>
by Jeffrey Low and L M Chou

<ICE-SIN:W2B-022#3:1>
The agaricid corals form a small part of the large number of
reef-building corals.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-022#4:1>
Of the six genera found world-wide, three are very common in local
waters, namely Pavona, Leptoseris, and Pachyseris.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-022#5:1>
These corals may be boulder-shaped ( massive) or encrusting, or more
commonly laminar ( plate-like) or foliaceous ( leaf-like).

<ICE-SIN:W2B-022#6:1>
They are common on protected reef slopes and in lagoons.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-022#7:1>
The genus Pazona can be differentiated from the other two by the
presence of corallites on both sides of the plate ( bifacial).

<ICE-SIN:W2B-022#8:1>
The corallites are inter-connected by thick plate-like walls called
septo-costae.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-022#9:1>
Pavona species are usually found on the upper reef slopes.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-022#10:1>
Some of the species are capable of attaining large dimensions, for
example Pavona cactus, which can grow to 10 metres in diameter in turbid
waters.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-022#11:1>
This species has thin, contorted and upright fronds, which are pale
or greenish brown in colour.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-022#12:1>
Together with another species, Pavona decussata, whose colonies have
thick, inter-connecting laminae, they are known to harbour various species of
porcellanid ( Porcellana sp.) and hairy ( Pilumnus sp.) crabs.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-022#13:1>
Growth form and colour variation in this genus can be quite varied.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-022#14:1>
Pavona explanulata for instance, has colonies that are encrusting or
has thin laminae, but it may sometimes be submissive or columnar.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-022#15:1>
This species is distinguished by a distinct column called the
columellae rising from the centre of the corallite.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-022#16:1>
Also, the polyps extend their tentacles during the day, and the
colour of the colonies may range from grey, brown, pink, purple, green,
yellow to mottled.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-022#17:1>
In Pavona clavus, the growth form may be columnar, laminar, or both.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-022#18:1>
This species is found mainly on the upper reef slopes that are
exposed to currents.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-022#19:1>
Colonies of Leptoseris can usually be found on the lower reefslopes,
under overhangs or in the openings of caverns, and also on lagoon floors and
on the ocean floor between reefs.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-022#20:1>
The corallites are found only on one face of the colony ( unifacial),
and are separated by irregular ridges.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-022#21:1>
Leptoseris explanata has laminae that are either lobed or entire, and
may be contorted or partly upright.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-022#22:1>
The corallites are widely spaced and facing outward, and the
septo-costae form conspicuous radiating ridges.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-022#23:1>
The colonies are pale or yellow brown with white margins.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-022#24:1>
Leptoseris scabra is encrusting and is highly contorted, sometimes
forming hollow columns and tubes or fronds.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-022#25:1>
The corallites are not outwardly inclined, and the colonies are
coloured dull grey or brown green with white margins.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-022#26:1>
Colonies of Pachyseris are similar to Leptoseris, being laminar and
unifacial, but the plates are highly contorted, with concentric ridges
running parallel to the edge.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-022#27:1>
The colonies may also be branching.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-022#28:1>
The corallite centres are not distinct, and there has been no record
of extended polyps being seen in the day or night.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-022#29:1>
Only two species have so far been found in Singapore.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-022#30:1>
Pachyseris rugosa has upright and contorted plates, and may be
coloured deep bluish grey or brown.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-022#31:1>
The colonies have been reported to grow to eight metres in diameter
in shallow turbid waters.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-022#32:1>
Pachyseris speciosa, on the other hand, may grow in a wide range of
habitats, but usually does not exceed two metres in diameter.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-022#33:1>
It is pale brown to deep grey, and is laminate, although upright
ridges and columns may develop. </I>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-022#36:2>
In 1981, the Singapore Science Centre released the first in its
guidebook series - A GUIDE TO POND LIFE, written by R S Bhathal and T S Foo.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-022#37:2>
Since then, 16 guides have been released, and the standard of the
books has been improving ever since.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-022#38:2>
Over 30,000 books have been sold, and it is still the most useful
reference for school children studying freshwater life in Singapore.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-022#39:2>
The present book endeavours to update as well as expand the scope of
that book.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-022#40:2>
While every attempt has been made to ensure the accuracy of the text,
I accept the onus for any mistakes which may have slipped through.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-022#41:2>
I am also grateful to Professor Anne Johnson for writing the
foreword.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-022#42:2>
Her husband, the late Professor Desmond S Johnson, was one of the
most respected limnologists in this region.

<h> INTRODUCTION </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-022#53:2>
Freshwater systems in Singapore have undergone a great deal of change
in the past 100 years.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-022#54:2>
As late as 1937, an American ichthyologist could still remark on the
variety of native tropical fish life found in our streams.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-022#55:2>
Development is inevitable, especially in a country as strapped for
resources as Singapore.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-022#56:2>
It is thus remarkable that so much aquatic life still abounds,
testimony to the adaptability and survival prowess of living organisms.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-022#57:2>
Freshwater habitats can be divided into several categories.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-022#58:2>
Freshwater biologists or limnologists, recognise two basic types
lentic and lotic.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-022#59:2>
Lentic habitats are bodies of flowing water.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-022#60:2>
Lotic habitats are stationary water bodies.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-022#61:2>
This division is merely one of convenience as they often merge into
one another.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-022#62:2>
The categories proposed by the late Professor D S Johnson, ie whether
they are forest or open-country, are more useful and will be followed here.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-022#63:2>
Open-country Fresh Waters - These are usually in areas which have
been developed and include agricultural land and large bodies of water.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-022#64:2>
These include: Ponds, lakes and reservoirs; monsoon canals and
drains; rural streams and riverine habitats.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-022#65:2>
The water in these habitats is generally eutrophic ( high levels of
organic matter and nutrients); not very clear due to suspended silt, soil
particles and phytoplankton; almost neutral to only slightly acidic or
alkaline ( pH 6-8); and only moderately hard ( ie with some dissolved salts
like calcium and bicarbonates).

<ICE-SIN:W2B-022#66:2>
The water in the raw water reservoirs are generally cleaner.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-022#67:2>
Forest Fresh Waters - Ponds; shallow streams and freshwater swamps.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-022#68:2>
The water in forest areas are generally oligotrophic ( low levels of
organic matter and nutrients); relatively clear ( unless disturbed) ( with
very little phytoplankton); acidic to highly acidic ( pH 1-6 and very soft (
ie with almost no dissolved salts).

<ICE-SIN:W2B-022#69:2>
The freshwater environment in Singapore is less complex than that of
its neighbours owing to the relatively small land area, and the absence of
any significantly large freshwater riverine systems.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-022#70:2>
The objective of this book is to provide readers, especially school
children and undergraduates with a reference to the more common organisms
which may be found by a reasonably observant person.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-022#71:2>
To expand the scope of the original book on POND LIFE, we have
included the flora and fauna of forest streams as well.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-022#72:2>
<h> THE CHEMISTRY OF FRESH WATER </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-022#73:2>
It is well known that fresh waters constitute only a miniscule part
of the water on earth.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-022#74:2>
Of this, about 2.15% is unavailable, frozen up as ice, mainly in the
North and South Poles.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-022#75:2>
The oceans and seas constitute a staggering 7.3% of all our water
supply.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-022#76:2>
Excluding the inland saline lakes, soil moisture and water vapour;
only about 0.6% of the water is fresh water; and most of this is underground.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-022#77:2>
All the surface lakes, ponds, reservoirs, rivers and streams contain
only 0.009% of the total water.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-022#78:2>
The chemical content of fresh water is often misunderstood.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-022#79:2>
Fresh water is not always free of dissolved matter.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-022#80:2>
In fact, it may often have much more dissolved salts that equivalent
seawater.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-022#81:2>
The distinction lies in the fact that seawater or the marine habitat
contains much more sodium, potassium and chloride ions.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-022#82:2>
While many freshwaters often have a relatively high
carbonate-bicarbonate component.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-022#83:2>
This is not the case in tropical areas where waters may become very
acidic.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-022#84:2>
Fresh water in general has a pH ( acid-alkaline scale) ranging from
4.4 to 8.6 ( in sharp contrast to the 7.8 to 8.3 of seawater).

<ICE-SIN:W2B-022#85:2>
The fresh water habitat, to dispel the " myth" that it is a
homogenous habitat, it is in fact, very heterogenous.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-022#86:2>
The problems of osmoregulation are well known; and it is not just
confined to too much water entering the organism.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-022#87:2>
To achieve a fine balance in salts often poses greater problems.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-022#88:2>
In Singapore fresh waters, temperatures during the day rarely exceed
35@C ( surface) even in open areas; and usually do not drop lower than 25@C
even in shaded forested areas at night.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-022#89:2>
At most times, temperatures range between 25.5 and 28@C.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-022#90:2>
The depth of the waters vary, but nowhere does very deep water occur.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-022#91:2>
Flowing waters rarely exceed two metres in depth during normal times,
but during monsoons, depths easily reach three metres.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-022#92:2>
In general, the depth increases as the waters flow closer to the sea,
becoming more brackish and subjected to tidal influences.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-022#93:2>
The completely freshwater reservoirs like Seletar, MacRitchie and
Peirce have depths of about 10 m or so.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-022#94:2>
Our waters are generally turbid, and at depths of three or four
metres, almost all the light has been absorbed.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-022#95:2>
Oxygen levels in general are high, exceeding 50% in cool forest areas
with flowing water.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-022#96:2>
In areas with dense submerged or aquatic vegetation, oxygen
saturation may even exceed 150% under strong sunlight because of
photosynthesis.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-022#97:2>
At night however, the oxygen levels in these areas become severely
depleted due to plant respiration; sometimes falling below 10% saturation.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-022#98:2>
This can lead to mass mortality of fish life due to asphyxiation.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-022#99:2>
Extreme habitats are not uncommonly found.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-022#100:2>
The waters of a monsoon drain are such an environment.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-022#101:2>
Direct sunlight, open terrain with little cover, polluted waters
with high ion and organic content, torrential water during rains etc all pose
tremendous challenges.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-022#102:2>
In such habitats, native animals tend to fare very badly.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-022#103:2>
Another " extreme habitat" is a freshwater swamp forest, where the
water sometimes gets so peaty ( laden with tannins and humic acids) that it
becomes brownish and highly acidic ( pH 5.5 or less) - a condition
limnologists term " blackwater".

<ICE-SIN:W2B-022#104:2>
Interestingly, many exotic and beautiful native fishes and prawns
survive in these stale or slow-flowing shallow waters with high acid levels
and large amounts of decaying vegetation.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-022#105:2>
<h> HOW TO USE THIS BOOK </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-022#106:2>
The present book treats the flora and fauna in a taxonomic way.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-022#107:2>
The number of groups of organisms of both plant and animal covered
in this book make it very difficult to have a " standardised" presentation.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-022#108:2>
The term " freshwater" is used as a adjective, eg freshwater
habitat, freshwater organism, freshwater fish, freshwater prawn etc.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-022#109:2>
When the water itself is discussed, we use the term fresh water" as
a noun instead.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-022#110:2>
It is extremely important to note that the names published here are
to be used by the layman carefully.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-022#111:2>
This is especially so when species names are given.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-022#112:2>
We have chosen what we believe are generally common species; but in
some places, other similar looking species may dominate.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-022#113:2>
Identifications to genus, family and orders can be more reliable (
in that order).

<ICE-SIN:W2B-022#114:2>
We are still a long way before we have precise names for many of our
aquatic animals and even further from understanding their often complex
ecology and general biology.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-022#115:2>
Some of the scientific names used here ( especially in water plants)
will differ somewhat from what has been published.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-022#116:2>
Changes here have been necessitated by revisions and corrections of
old mistakes.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-022#117:2>
The original guidebook on pond life was designed for younger school
children.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-022#118:2>
Hence, a minimum of jargon, technical and scientific names was used.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-022#119:2>
In the last ten years however, education standards have risen
sharply, and students in general, expect more.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-022#120:2>
The present book has now been conceived to suit students up to the
undergraduate level.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-022#121:2>
Consequently, we have tried our best to achieve a " tricky balance"
- a text that is easily understood pleasant to read and yet, " respectable".

<ICE-SIN:W2B-022#122:2>
Some of the more basic aspects have been omitted. <X> There has been
an intended " bias" towards the plants and water insects in this book because
these have been poorly or inadequately dealt with in other books. </X> </I>
