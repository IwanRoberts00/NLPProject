<I>

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-029#1:1:A>
Okay I think with that we can come to our studio guest Suresh

<ICE-SIN:S1B-029#2:1:A>
I know you're raring to tell us your point of view as well

<ICE-SIN:S1B-029#3:1:A>
Okay as a person who came up with the uh kiasu comic uh books and
the kiasu character what is your reaction to the calls so far

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-029#4:1:B>
Well first of all there were a couple of us that got together
to do the book and I must say that uhm a comic book a kiasu comic book is not
a promotion of kiasuism

<ICE-SIN:S1B-029#5:1:B>
On the contrary it is suppose to make Singaporeans more aware of the
kiasu behaviours and that was what sort of uh inspired us to do the book in
the first place

<ICE-SIN:S1B-029#6:1:B>
We're in the humour business and we tend to look on the lighter side
of things

<ICE-SIN:S1B-029#7:1:B>
It is fine to say have a anti-kiasu campaign and we would probably
support it but being people in the humour business we do it you know by
looking at the funny side of it

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-029#8:1:A>
Okay Agnes is there a down side to this funny side

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-029#9:1:C>
Well if they were to look at it the same way as Suresh and his
co-writer which look at it is uhm looking at humour and that we should learn
to laugh at ourselves I think there's nothing wrong with it

<ICE-SIN:S1B-029#10:1:C>
However you find that uh depending on the maturity of the readers
then young children may think that well if that's the way of life in
Singapore and if it is being uh publicised so why not and on the other hand
of course with this uhm capitalisation by commercial firms of using Mr Kiasu
to promote their goods I think it can sort <unclear> word </unclear> in a way
be blown out of uh view you see

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-029#11:1:A>
But I mean wouldn't wouldn't you say that the use of humour to
convey messages even that uhm that are negative in this way that to
discourage people from from emulating those that those personality traits
it's always been done and I presume you are you are following that tradition

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-029#12:1:B>
Yes I think uh people are bombarded with all kinds of messages
especially in Singapore campaign after campaign telling them what they should
do and what they shouldn't do

<ICE-SIN:S1B-029#13:1:B>
Sometimes it would be effective to use humour because a person gets
entertained and in the process perhaps some of the messages get through

<ICE-SIN:S1B-029#14:1:B>
But if you were to tell him that he shouldn't do this and that he
gets turned off and we think that we're probably uh more effective in getting
the anti-kiasu message across than promoting kiasuism

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-029#15:1:A>
Agnes would you say that that is uhm is there a cautionary
note to that

<ICE-SIN:S1B-029#16:1:A>
I'm sure you wouldn't disagree with that by saying how <unclear>
word </unclear> we wouldn't

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-029#17:1:C>
Well no I wouldn't

<ICE-SIN:S1B-029#18:1:C>
Well as I said before you see you are trying to tell them not to be
kiasu but you have no control over how they view it

<ICE-SIN:S1B-029#19:1:C>
Will they be taking it as a lesson yes it's something we shouldn't
do or it's something that well it's something that we should emulate so

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-029#20:1:B>
I think we should uh sorry I think we should give credit to
young people even children uh sometimes we tend to think that they get easily
influenced by comics

<ICE-SIN:S1B-029#21:1:B>
We all grow up by watching Popeye the sailor and we haven't become
started speaking like Popeye

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-029#22:1:A>
Okay okay thank you thank you very much I think with that
we've come to the end of this part of the discussion and it's clear that
kiasu promotions are meant to allow us to laugh at ourselves at least that's
the intention and yes I think we we we need to do more of that but the
problem is are we celebrating a behaviour that's not that funny that selfish
inconsiderate behaviour

<ICE-SIN:S1B-029#23:1:A>
Well I know you're raring to tell us some of your own personal
encounters okay the number to call is six nine one one three double zero
that's six nine one one three zero zero

<ICE-SIN:S1B-029#24:1:A>
Just keep dialing that number we want to hear your experiences with
the kiasus after this break(Phone-in interviews)

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-029#25:1:A>
Okay I think with that we will come to our studio guests again

<ICE-SIN:S1B-029#26:1:A>
The the importance of drawing a distinction between qualities that
are obviously bad okay like what we talked about so far and the good
qualities like being diligent being hardworking being cautious

<ICE-SIN:S1B-029#27:1:A>
Do you think this is important to make a distinction between the
two

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-029#28:1:C>
Oh yes as a matter of fact I think that uhm when we first coin
the word being kiasu is always very negative in terms of being greedy a
selfish grabby so but when we try to link up that with competitiveness in
terms of being prepared and being diligent I don't think it should be uhm
come under the same term as being kiasu

<ICE-SIN:S1B-029#29:1:C>
Instead as a matter of fact it's a good strategy in terms of being
prepared for any kind of challenges and that comes under the same strategies
as shun zi ping fa

<ICE-SIN:S1B-029#30:1:C>
So I think we have to be very distinctive about what we called the
kiasuism and what is being called being prepared in terms of some kind of
working strategies

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-029#31:1:A>
Would would you say that uh some Singaporeans are using this
as a crutch as it were for lack of better way of putting it for their own
inadequacies but blaming other people who are hardworking by calling them
kiasu

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-029#32:1:C>
Oh yes I would think so because as a matter of fact you find
that the people have been using the word kiasu so loosely I would say that we
have to think very carefully as what is their definition of kiasu because I
think that there could be ten different definitions for kiasu according to
what the person wants

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-029#33:1:A>
Yah talking about definitions Suresh did you take into account
this this this point when you came up with the books

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-029#34:1:B>
Our understanding of kiasu is someone who wants to win at all
cost

<ICE-SIN:S1B-029#35:1:B>
A person who works hard I'll give you an example perhaps the
Olympic games Carl Lewis and Ben Johnson Karl Lewis wants to win

<ICE-SIN:S1B-029#36:1:B>
Perhaps he trains twelve hours a day Ben Johnson also wants to win
but he uses an unfair method uses drugs

<ICE-SIN:S1B-029#37:1:B>
That is a kiasu you know a person who wants to win at all cost even
unfair so if people can understand that difference I think a lot of these
fears are quite unfounded

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-029#38:1:A>
But do you feel that that difference comes through clearly
without being ambiguous in your books

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-029#39:1:B>
In our books

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-029#40:1:A>
Uhm

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-029#41:1:B>
Uh we make a special effort to show whenever Mr Kiasu does
something uh bad he pays for it

<ICE-SIN:S1B-029#42:1:B>
You see there's a situation where he tries to beat someone to it to
to grab a taxi at the end of which he goes onto a lane gets run over by a
taxi

<ICE-SIN:S1B-029#43:1:B>
That's the kind of situations that we put into the book so you know

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-029#44:1:A>
Last comment from Agnes a cautionary note very quickly

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-029#45:1:C>
Yes oh uh here I think that uh what Suresh is doing is is
something very positive but I have one word to add and in the sense that uh
being kiasu children will learn not just from just the comics alone but from
the behaviour of adults

<ICE-SIN:S1B-029#46:1:C>
That's what I'm very much afraid of because if adults felt that
it's it's quite a a fair game to be kiasu the young children because not all
of them will read the comics but they will observe the important adults
around them and that's my greatest fear

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-029#47:1:A>
Words of wisdom really

<ICE-SIN:S1B-029#48:1:A>
Thank you very much

<ICE-SIN:S1B-029#49:1:A>
Thank you Suresh thank you Agnes

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-029#50:1:C>
Thank you

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-029#51:1:A>
Well with that comment we can quite comfortably wrap up this
discussion I think

<ICE-SIN:S1B-029#52:1:A>
Thank you panelists for joining me in the studio

<ICE-SIN:S1B-029#53:1:A>
Well what can I say

<ICE-SIN:S1B-029#54:1:A>
Looks like we are living in quite a miserable country plagued by
selfish inconsiderate kiasus

<ICE-SIN:S1B-029#55:1:A>
Hey but is that really true

<ICE-SIN:S1B-029#56:1:A>
Is kiasuism so rampant a trade that it is the hallmark of the
Singaporean as suggested by some of us

<ICE-SIN:S1B-029#57:1:A>
Yes we are kiasu and we should do something about it but are not
being a little too hard on ourselves sometimes

<ICE-SIN:S1B-029#58:1:A>
Why do we have to swing between we are number one breast beating uh
to we are kiasu brow beating

<ICE-SIN:S1B-029#59:1:A>
Come on let's give ourselves more credit

<ICE-SIN:S1B-029#60:1:A>
We do have our redeeming qualities and we're not really that
different from the people in other countries

<ICE-SIN:S1B-029#61:1:A>
Let's not be so kiasu

<ICE-SIN:S1B-029#62:1:A>
Thank you for calling in and remember if it concerns you it
concerns us

<ICE-SIN:S1B-029#63:1:A>
This has been Talking Point </I>


<I>

<$D> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-029#64:2:D>
Alright Doctor Chua you've just heard uhm from a few calls

<ICE-SIN:S1B-029#65:2:D>
Do you think that that's a fair assessment that you know we
stereotype people

<$E> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-029#66:2:E>
Well uhm I'm glad most of the callers justify that there is a
mi <unclear> word </unclear> a small majority of pe <unclear> word </unclear>
employers who are uh abusing their maids

<ICE-SIN:S1B-029#67:2:E>
But uhm employers most employers are not stereotype neither are
maids

<ICE-SIN:S1B-029#68:2:E>
Uh there are good maids there are bad maids so we shall concentrate
on the bad maids

<ICE-SIN:S1B-029#69:2:E>
Uhm to stereotype I don't think it's a good uh point for a
discussion because sometimes we have to recognise that maids if they are
pushed to the wall they have no other way but to uh react the way they do

<$D> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-029#70:2:D>
Doctor Chung do you agree with uhm Doctor Chua's assessment

<$F> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-029#71:2:F>
Yes to an extent I feel that the whole issue of uh employer
maid relationship is actually quite complex because the <unclear> word
</unclear> the relationship between the employer and employee is actually
quite different from that of any other work situation

<ICE-SIN:S1B-029#72:2:F>
When you hire a maid you're actually employing her to undertake
house work and child care for example

<ICE-SIN:S1B-029#73:2:F>
These are actually very broad terms which can cover a wide
multitude of tasks for example and therefore <unclear> word </unclear> it is
difficult to draw parameters as to what exactly constitute the task that
should be done

<ICE-SIN:S1B-029#74:2:F>
So because of this there could be difficulties uh by interpreting
what should be the parameters for her job

<ICE-SIN:S1B-029#75:2:F>
I think additional another point to be made also is that in
reference to a call that was made earlier on about how when you pay two fifty
then you expect to get that much service out of her

<ICE-SIN:S1B-029#76:2:F>
It it has got to be realised is and and this is a point that has
been made by Doctor Nirmala PuruShotam who is research on the subject

<ICE-SIN:S1B-029#77:2:F>
Now actually what is happening when you employ your maid is that
you actually moving from house work that was done for free by the woman of
the house that is the wife and the mother to now uhm work that you have to
pay for

<ICE-SIN:S1B-029#78:2:F>
In other words you're actually paying two hundred and fifty dollars
and and more because if if you take in consideration board and lodgings where
previously it was serviced without a fee

<$D> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-029#79:2:D>
Doctor Chua do you think why do you think that kind of
mentality arises I mean as a psychologist

<$E> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-029#80:2:E>
About uh employers abusing their maids

<$D> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-029#81:2:D>
No about the fact that because we pay a certain amount of
money we expect this kind of uhm service

<$E> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-029#82:2:E>
That uhm there is a possibility uh possible uh explanation
what we re generally referred to as transference uh theory whereby most
employers they're working in a working environment as an employees

<ICE-SIN:S1B-029#83:2:E>
Employers who are generally bad to them generally they like to take
this uh phenomena back home and transfer it to the employees which is their
maid

<ICE-SIN:S1B-029#84:2:E>
Uh but uh we have to recognise that employers work in a different
environment maids work in another environment

<ICE-SIN:S1B-029#85:2:E>
The maids are most subservient to them rather than employee uhm
employers themselves who are employees in the work place so it's usually a
transference phenomena here <X>

<$D> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-029#X86:2:D>
Uhm alright thank you Well we've just heard some different
reasons as to why employers behave the way they do Do you agree We'll also
like to hear how you think we can deal with all this We're going for a break
now when we come back your responses </X> </I>
