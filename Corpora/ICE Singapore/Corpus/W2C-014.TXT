<h> Bosses and unions split on CPF contributions for workers over 55
</h>

<ICE-SIN:W2C-014#3:1>
EMPLOYERS and unionists are divided over how much Central Provident
Fund contributions of older employees should be cut in return for allowing
them to work past 55.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-014#4:1>
The Singapore National Employers' Federation ( SNEF) wants both
employees' and employers' Central Provident Fund contributions for workers
aged between 56 and 59 to be cut from 12.5 per cent to 7.5 per cent of their
monthly salaries.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-014#5:1>
It has also suggested that the government stop CPF contributions for
those above 60 who have paid their housing loans and have enough in CPF and
Medisave accounts to pay their medical bills.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-014#6:1>
Union leaders are against the proposals which are backed by the
Singapore Manufacturers Association ( SMA).

<ICE-SIN:W2C-014#7:1>
They said that if existing contribution rates had to be cut, the
reduction should not be more than 2.5 percentage points for those between 55
and 59.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-014#8:1>
They also rejected the suggestion that CPF contributions were
unnecessary for employees above 60.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-014#9:1>
They argued that many who continued to work after reaching the
traditional retirement age of 56 needed Central Provident Fund funds to
service their housing loans.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-014#10:1>
These workers must also continue to top up their Medisave accounts to
ensure that they will be able to pay hospitalisation bills.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-014#11:1>
The current rate for those between 60 and 64 is 15 per cent, and for
that for 65 and above is 10 per cent.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-014#12:1>
The contributions are split equally between workers and employers.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-014#13:1>
The rate for those below 55 is 18 per cent for employers and 22 per
cent for workers.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-014#14:1>
Labour Minister Dr Lee Boon Yang announced in Parliament on March 18
that Central Provident Fund rules for older employees will be revised in
tandem with the proposed legislation to impose a minimum retirement age of
60.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-014#15:1>
He gave no details but rejected a call to exempt workers above 55
from contributing to CPF.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-014#16:1>
SNEF president Stephen Lee declined to comment on the percentage of
Central Provident Fund cuts expected by the federation.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-014#17:1>
But he pointed out that companies paying less CPF could offer higher
salaries to retirees.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-014#18:1>
An SMA spokesman said the five percentage point cut SNEF proposed
would help offset any loss in productivity from employing older workers who
are generally slower than their younger colleagues.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-014#19:1>
The extension of the retirement age, he said, made it necessary to
step up efforts to upgrade the skills of Singaporeans in their 40s and early
50s who wi11 be able to work till 60.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-014#20:1>
Mr Diong Tai Pew, president of the Association of Small and Medium
Enterprises, argued that a cut of 5 percentage points in CPF for employees
between 55 and 59 would help them to compete better for jobs.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-014#21:1>
He said the Government would allow those above 60 to ask their
employers to stop making CPF contributions if they have enough savings.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-014#22:1>
Speaking for workers, Nominated MP Tong Kok Yeo, the general
secretary of Union of Telecoms Employees of Singapore, said a moderate cut of
around 3 percentage points for those aged between 55 and 59 would be more
palatable for those concerned about rising medical costs.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-014#23:1>
Two other unionists, Mr Victor Pang and Mr Cyrille Tan - wanted the
present CPF rate to be maintained.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-014#24:1>
But they were ready to accept a reduction of 2.5 percentage points in
the rate for those aged between 55 and 59 Mr Pang, general secretary of the
Singapore Airport Terminal Services Workers' Union, said that with average
life spans of around 70, those working after 55 need their Central Provident
Fund savings for the next 20 years of their lives Mr Tan, general secretary
of the United Workers of Electronic and Electrical Industries, said that deep
cuts in the current rates would contradict the Government's aim of ensuring
that older Singaporeans had sufficient funds for their old age. </I>

<h> Civil servants can now take half day annual leave on Saturdays
</h>

<ICE-SIN:W2C-014#26:2>
By Ahmad Osman

<ICE-SIN:W2C-014#27:2>
CIVIL servants are now allowed to take half day annual leave on
Saturdays.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-014#28:2>
But they can do this for only a maximum of six Saturdays in a year if
their services are not required, a spokesman for the Public Service Division
said on Tuesday.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-014#29:2>
The policy took effect on June 2, she said, and would meet the needs
of those who cannot avoid appointments at the end of a 5 1/2-day work week.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-014#30:2>
It was introduced about nine years after the Government revised the
rule requiring civil servants to take full day leave on week days, weekends
and the eve of public holidays.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-014#31:2>
They were allowed to take a half day off on week days.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-014#32:2>
Feedback gathered by the division since then showed that many
employees wanted the scheme to be extended to Saturdays.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-014#33:2>
They felt that it was not fair to take a day's leave on Saturdays
when all they needed were only a few hours.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-014#34:2>
The spokesman said that the limit of six Saturdays would ensure that
there would be enough people to provide public services on weekends.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-014#35:2>
It would also prevent any abuse of the holiday leave arrangement.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-014#36:2>
If unlimited half-day leave was allowed, an employee with 2 days'
annual leave, for example, could take every Saturday off for the whole year.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-014#37:2>
He would work a five day, instead of a 5 1/2-day week.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-014#38:2>
The Government had made it clear in the past that the 66,000 strong
civil service would not set the trend for the majority of the companies in
the private sector to switch to a five day work week.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-014#39:2>
A 5 1/2-day work week is the norm for 70 per cent of the 122,000
companies in Singapore, which numbers about 900,000 employees.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-014#40:2>
As most of these companies already allow their staff to take half-day
leave on Saturdays, the latest government policy is not likely to have a
major impact on them.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-014#41:2>
But it will be welcomed by the 66,000 employees in more than 40
statutory boards who have to work for 5 1/2 days a week.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-014#42:2>
The Housing Board, Port of Singapore Authority, Public Utilities
Board and Singapore Tourist Promotion Board have adopted the new policy.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-014#43:2>
Statutory boards have the autonomy to decide whether they should
follow the policy, the spokesman said. </I>

<h> Registrar seeks A-G's help to settle co-op row </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2C-014#45:3>
By Ahmad Osman THE Registrar of Co-operative Societies, Mr Ng Fui
Fong has asked the Attorney General for legal advice to help settle a dispute
between two groups battling for the leadership of a thrift and loan society.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-014#46:3>
He wrote to the Attorney General after the group of four, who lost an
election held by Telecoms Credit Coperative Society, failed to comply with a
recommendation he made on April 22 this year.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-014#47:3>
He had asked the losers and the four victors to settle their
differences over the result of the election on April 4 through arbitration in
the High Court.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-014#48:3>
The winners - Messrs Chandra Mogan, Abdul Aziz Sulong, Tan Chwee Kim,
and Dominic Wong complied.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-014#49:3>
They filed an application to the court to ask the Chief Justice to
appoint an arbitrator to look into a complaint by their rivals that there
were irregularities in the election.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-014#50:3>
Messrs S Shanmugam, Lee Kim Hong, A.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-014#51:3>
K.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-014#52:3>
Latchumanan and Lim Joo Chye wrote earlier to Mr Ng on April 5
claiming, among other things, that many members did not have time to cast
their votes during the election.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-014#53:3>
But they missed the deadline set by the Registrar for both parties to
apply for the appointment of an arbitrator.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-014#54:3>
Their main backer, Mr S.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-014#55:3>
Moganaruban, the society's chairman, chaired an extraordinary general
meeting on May 22 sought by about 400 members.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-014#56:3>
About 1,600 members present elected the losers of the April election
into the society's management committee.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-014#57:3>
It was held a day after the court lifted an interim injunction
preventing Messrs Chandra Mogan and his team mates from holding office,
pending the outcome of the complaint referred earlier to Mr Ng.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-014#58:3>
The action taken by the four who lost the April election has left the
Registrar in a quandary.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-014#59:3>
He does not have the power under the Co-operative Societies Act to
force both parties to accept his recommendation to go for arbitration.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-014#60:3>
He has asked the Attorney General to advise him on his next step and
is seeking answers to several questions.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-014#61:3>
One issue raised by Mr Chandra Mogan and his team mates is whether
members should be allowed to hold an EOGM to throw out four officials whose
election had not been declared as null and void by the court or the
Registrar.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-014#62:3>
He said he will write to the Registrar to challenge the legality of
the EOGM.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-014#63:3>
" If the other group gets away with what they did, members will be
discouraged from contesting elections the society will hold in future as they
can be thrown out even if they win," he said.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-014#64:3>
He said his group were not happy over the society's investment in
Premier Travel, a company which had been losing money for a few years.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-014#65:3>
In April's election, members approved the management committee's
request to invest another
&dollar;500,000 in the firm.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-014#66:3>
Mr Moganaruban said they were aware the company was losing money and
that additional funds were needed to improve its performance.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-014#67:3>
He said the EOGM he chaired was held in accordance with the by-laws
set by the society.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-014#68:3>
He said an Extraordinary General Meeting must be held within one
month after the committee receives a petition signed by at least 100 of the
society's 4,300 members. </I>

<h> Local canned food maker plans
&dollar;18m venture in France </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2C-014#70:4>
Asian dishes to be made in 'self heating' cans

<ICE-SIN:W2C-014#71:4>
By Kevin Lim A LOCAL food manufacturer Effort Holdings, is finalising
plans to set up an
&dollar;18 million factory in France to produce Asian dishes like chicken curry in "
self-heating" containers for the European market.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-014#72:4>
It has already drawn up plans for the new factory and has obtained
about 12 acres of free land from the French authorities, its managing
director, Mr Paul Tan, said.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-014#73:4>
The company has not however made a firm commitment to the French
government, as it is awaiting the results of a detailed study to test the
demand for its product, which is going on at the moment, he said.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-014#74:4>
The results of an earlier preliminary survey had been " very good",
he added.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-014#75:4>
The factory will be the first Singaporean " greenfield" investment in
France should it materialise, said the French Trade Commissioner in
Singapore, Mr Regis Baudion when contacted yesterday.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-014#76:4>
Effort, which had sales of about
&dollar;10 million last year, currently operates out of a single factory at Pandan
Loop.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-014#77:4>
The company, a supplier of cooked food to hospitals and army units,
expects its sales to grow to between
&dollar;15 and
&dollar;17 million this year, said Mr Tan.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-014#78:4>
Besides Mr Tan, who owns about 21 per cent of the company, other
shareholders include listed Guthrie GTS, which has a 29-per cent stake.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-014#79:4>
Effort won the Euromark award, a European award for innovation in
food science and technology earlier this year for the self-heating canned
meal which it intends to produce in France.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-014#80:4>
Basically, the product comes in a metal container with an attached
burner underneath.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-014#81:4>
All one needs to do is to pull a tab to set off the heating device
which then lights up to heat the meal.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-014#82:4>
The company won the Singapore Institute of Food Science and
Technology's Best Food Award for the same product last year.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-014#83:4>
Giving details of the proposed investment, Mr Tan said Effort's plans
involves the construction of a single-storey l00,000 sq ft building at
Barlaluc, which is in the north-east of France.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-014#84:4>
It expects to employ about 150 French workers or more than the 100
persons it employs at home.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-014#85:4>
It will take a 51 per cent take in the factory, with the remainder to
be held by a French investment company called Societe Tikili.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-014#86:4>
Mr Tan added that the Singapore company has received enquiries about
possible joint ventures from several interested foreign parties. </I>
