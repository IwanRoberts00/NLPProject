<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-042#1:1:A>
I I hope to be able to to address your question

<ICE-SIN:S2A-042#2:1:A>
I think which you know is gonna be more interesting and let's have a
more interactive sort of a a discussion session

<ICE-SIN:S2A-042#3:1:A>
Uh as you can tell you know from you know from the brief
introduction of my experience

<ICE-SIN:S2A-042#4:1:A>
Uh I have worked in many many different areas in terms of you know
uhm functional areas

<ICE-SIN:S2A-042#5:1:A>
But in terms of the group of customers you know that I deal with you
know I find that the the SMP you know or the entrepreneurs you know some of
them are at least is indeed the most uh exciting and rewarding

<ICE-SIN:S2A-042#6:1:A>
From my point of view it has also been the most frustrating you know
because to deal with these people that have got enough egos that sort of you
know roll all over you

<ICE-SIN:S2A-042#7:1:A>
If they're successful can be quite a bit of a challenge just uh

<ICE-SIN:S2A-042#8:1:A>
So I would be than happy to share with you some of my experiences

<ICE-SIN:S2A-042#9:1:A>
Just before I start off you know reading so called from my my text

<ICE-SIN:S2A-042#10:1:A>
Uh I work with a number of different people uh including people
that have form a company that is for example uh S Tech

<ICE-SIN:S2A-042#11:1:A>
You might have heard of it which is a compatible to to Creative
Technology that is a lot of my clients

<ICE-SIN:S2A-042#12:1:A>
Uh Kent Hurst you know the direct marketing people has another
client of mine you know

<ICE-SIN:S2A-042#13:1:A>
I have got another client that is an inventor you know that took
the simple cable and decided to do something different with it you know

<ICE-SIN:S2A-042#14:1:A>
Uh and the list goes on

<ICE-SIN:S2A-042#15:1:A>
I work with a number of different people that got some you know
marvelous ideas looking at convention businesses and you know having a fresh
look at how they would package things uhm

<ICE-SIN:S2A-042#16:1:A>
So very exciting and I'm you know hopefully you know uh all that I
see in front of me

<ICE-SIN:S2A-042#17:1:A>
Everyone of you are people have the spirit in you that one day and
you gonna go out there and do do your thing

<ICE-SIN:S2A-042#18:1:A>
But ladies and gentlemen to start with you recall businessman
Robert Ng's remarks you know on the virtues on greed

<ICE-SIN:S2A-042#19:1:A>
I'm sure at the recent Pre-univeristy Seminar that has sparked off
much discussion and debates you know and letters in the press

<ICE-SIN:S2A-042#20:1:A>
Now I do not intend to be as provocative this evening being maybe
being an accountant you know basically you know I got to be a little bit more
conservative

<ICE-SIN:S2A-042#21:1:A>
I'm here only you know to give you some ideas so you can then
challenge you know amongst yourself and with me some of these ideas

<ICE-SIN:S2A-042#22:1:A>
Indeed you know this topic of entrepreneurship and what is it has
generated much discussion you know in terms of you know definition not just
in Singapore but all over the world it has

<ICE-SIN:S2A-042#23:1:A>
What I hope to achieve today in fact is to leave behind some ideas
of what entrepreneurship is all about and who the real entrepreneurs are

<ICE-SIN:S2A-042#24:1:A>
As you would see later on during the rest of my speech you know
this concept of entrepreneurship also changes with the times you know

<ICE-SIN:S2A-042#25:1:A>
And it will change as to how we are perceive you know
entrepreneurship

<ICE-SIN:S2A-042#26:1:A>
Ten years from today will be different from what we do to uh ten
years twenty years thirty years down the road

<ICE-SIN:S2A-042#27:1:A>
Now in the course of my presentation I'll be drawing from examples
of real life entrepreneurs to help illustrate my point

<ICE-SIN:S2A-042#28:1:A>
Some of these people are people I know personally

<ICE-SIN:S2A-042#29:1:A>
Some are clients whom we have serve while others are personalities
such as Sim Wong Hu of Creative Technology Michael Dell of Dell Computers
Frederick Smith the founder of Federal Express </I>


<I>

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-042#30:2:B>
Good argument

<ICE-SIN:S2A-042#31:2:B>
I had an argument with you know some of my staff in the office
about this concept

<ICE-SIN:S2A-042#32:2:B>
The looking at McDonalds in Singapore their introduction of the
Kiasu Burger

<ICE-SIN:S2A-042#33:2:B>
Now is that entrepreneurship

<ICE-SIN:S2A-042#34:2:B>
Some would argue yes it's entrepreneurship because you seeing a a
unique taste there you know

<ICE-SIN:S2A-042#35:2:B>
Some of the marketing programmes is it entrepreneurship

<ICE-SIN:S2A-042#36:2:B>
Yes creating demand you know it's you know in spite of using in a
or fix franchise

<ICE-SIN:S2A-042#37:2:B>
You adapt to the local market and change it and you grow additional
business that is entrepreneurship as well </I>


<I>

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-042#38:3:C>
So I mean you can that if if you are a little adverse or if
you are lacking in in in in in in for example capital to take forward an idea
you can you know find you know a a company that is you know as enlightened as
three M you know and be able to pursue you know even entrepreneurship within
you know an organisation

<ICE-SIN:S2A-042#39:3:C>
But certainly that's very enlightening

<ICE-SIN:S2A-042#40:3:C>
Some of these stories are very interesting

<ICE-SIN:S2A-042#41:3:C>
Uh Federal Express for example the way they first started they
became very very successful

<ICE-SIN:S2A-042#42:3:C>
Now with it went off you know faxes voice-mail

<ICE-SIN:S2A-042#43:3:C>
What is gonna be the next lap for them What's gonna happen to this
company

<ICE-SIN:S2A-042#44:3:C>
I'm watching I don't know what will happen to them

<ICE-SIN:S2A-042#45:3:C>
Let's see what will happen to them some of these story

<ICE-SIN:S2A-042#46:3:C>
So nothing is forever

<ICE-SIN:S2A-042#47:3:C>
You gotta keep changing all the time and this is what
entrepreneurship is all about you know

<ICE-SIN:S2A-042#48:3:C>
The ones with the continue sea of potential customer demand goes up
there and satisfies that demand as an idea and be able to convert that idea
into reality

<ICE-SIN:S2A-042#49:3:C>
Now a lot people have ideas now is that entrepreneurship just ideas

<ICE-SIN:S2A-042#50:3:C>
How you know I've seen so many people with just ideas

<ICE-SIN:S2A-042#51:3:C>
But some people just never convert their dream as they will forever
be dreamers

<ICE-SIN:S2A-042#52:3:C>
I've got some very bright friends mine very clever people mind you
and you know every a year or so in fact about two years once they sur
resurface and and I'll ask them what happen to your that last idea you know

<ICE-SIN:S2A-042#53:3:C>
And I know you know nothing has happen

<ICE-SIN:S2A-042#54:3:C>
And they were good ideas because you know he what's lacking is you
remember the definition of entrepreneur you need the managerial capability to
see through as you are

<ICE-SIN:S2A-042#55:3:C>
Just as important it's not just ideas but do you ever see through
as important just as important

<ICE-SIN:S2A-042#56:3:C>
Any other questions

<ICE-SIN:S2A-042#57:3:C>
Okay

<ICE-SIN:S2A-042#58:3:C>
I'm going to be very provocative here

<ICE-SIN:S2A-042#59:3:C>
The people going ten years from now twenty years from now looking
at two two sets you know two possibilities

<ICE-SIN:S2A-042#60:3:C>
If I have a child that has to be in the job market twenty years
from now in Singapore want of the good life want a comfortable life rewarding
life

<ICE-SIN:S2A-042#61:3:C>
If you're not sure whether you're going to succeed my answer to the
question be a technician be a good electrician be a good plumber be a good
car mechanic

<ICE-SIN:S2A-042#62:3:C>
You'll be in good demand isn't it

<ICE-SIN:S2A-042#63:3:C>
Don't be a graduate forget it if you're gonna be mediocre graduate

<ICE-SIN:S2A-042#64:3:C>
Forget it

<ICE-SIN:S2A-042#65:3:C>
Either that or be prepared to work overseas not in Singapore

<ICE-SIN:S2A-042#66:3:C>
So the time will come when you know must <unclear> word </unclear>
agree with your proposition now

<ICE-SIN:S2A-042#67:3:C>
You want to go through the list of some these people who uh the
Singaporeans that at least that I know of here

<ICE-SIN:S2A-042#68:3:C>
You note the strange thing is that the outcast in the sense you
know that has succeed you know a lot of these people that have succeed they
are outcast damn out and outcast

<ICE-SIN:S2A-042#69:3:C>
I can tell you that

<ICE-SIN:S2A-042#70:3:C>
Some of these people our society have you know prejudice you know
against them

<ICE-SIN:S2A-042#71:3:C>
Why

<ICE-SIN:S2A-042#72:3:C>
Because a lot of them were Chinese educated

<ICE-SIN:S2A-042#73:3:C>
They're good technicians but they went to technical school they
cannot speak properly

<ICE-SIN:S2A-042#74:3:C>
They cannot won't and can't get pass an interview

<ICE-SIN:S2A-042#75:3:C>
You want to go and get a job with IBM they won't go pass the
screening test because they can't speak proper English

<ICE-SIN:S2A-042#76:3:C>
So they are force into the situation

<ICE-SIN:S2A-042#77:3:C>
So they become very good technician

<ICE-SIN:S2A-042#78:3:C>
A lot of the entrepreneurs I meet now are people like that

<ICE-SIN:S2A-042#79:3:C>
With their technical education Chinese educated

<ICE-SIN:S2A-042#80:3:C>
They are force by circumstances to go out there they are clever
people

<ICE-SIN:S2A-042#81:3:C>
They can see it they can't express it in the lingua franca in the
business environment here

<ICE-SIN:S2A-042#82:3:C>
So they are force to go out there and make it

<ICE-SIN:S2A-042#83:3:C>
By doing it themselves they cannot do it with anybody under the
establish standards they will never make it

<ICE-SIN:S2A-042#84:3:C>
So that's one group of them very interesting group

<ICE-SIN:S2A-042#85:3:C>
They're a group

<ICE-SIN:S2A-042#86:3:C>
Look at these people he is only a you know technical educated he is
not a full-fledge engineer to my knowledge

<ICE-SIN:S2A-042#87:3:C>
Anybody knows he's an engineer

<ICE-SIN:S2A-042#88:3:C>
I don't think he's an engineer

<ICE-SIN:S2A-042#89:3:C>
Alfred is not you know

<ICE-SIN:S2A-042#90:3:C>
He's very you know very impressive when he stands up to speak he'll
be a salesman not

<ICE-SIN:S2A-042#91:3:C>
I got another client the direct marketing company 'O' levels

<ICE-SIN:S2A-042#92:3:C>
Definitely not a graduate

<ICE-SIN:S2A-042#93:3:C>
He is a doctor Wong Kai is

<ICE-SIN:S2A-042#94:3:C>
So you're right

<ICE-SIN:S2A-042#95:3:C>
By and large they are the people that are you know not graduate

<ICE-SIN:S2A-042#96:3:C>
They're also you know force by circumstances you know to have to
strike it out on their own

<ICE-SIN:S2A-042#97:3:C>
Now that's one side of looking the other side of course is you know
I mean you know once you know we we we I chatted with you know this child you
know in the office just now

<ICE-SIN:S2A-042#98:3:C>
And then we I have this discussion with you know some of you know
the people in my office you know the younger generation so to speak

<ICE-SIN:S2A-042#99:3:C>
And we sort of talk about quality of life and what what you want to
do in life you know

<ICE-SIN:S2A-042#100:3:C>
And you know they came up with a very interesting proposition says
well the best career you know comfortable life in Singapore if you are
graduate recent graduate join the army

<ICE-SIN:S2A-042#101:3:C>
In seven years or so you'll be a major

<ICE-SIN:S2A-042#102:3:C>
You could be very well paid

<ICE-SIN:S2A-042#103:3:C>
There are no wars in this region

<ICE-SIN:S2A-042#104:3:C>
You're being well-looked after

<ICE-SIN:S2A-042#105:3:C>
It's so comfortable why should I take a risk

<ICE-SIN:S2A-042#106:3:C>
I mean that's kind of sad you know isn't it

<ICE-SIN:S2A-042#107:3:C>
But this is you know this are my you know we hire pretty good
people in my organisation

<ICE-SIN:S2A-042#108:3:C>
And these are the people that tell me this there some of these
discussion goes on amongst you know fellow graduates

<ICE-SIN:S2A-042#109:3:C>
So any the enlistment officer is just next door for you to sign on
and say potential majors

<ICE-SIN:S2A-042#110:3:C>
So I think you know things will change but I think it's changing
because of the environment changing you know

<ICE-SIN:S2A-042#111:3:C>
More graduates you know would have to take the risk you know
because there aren't enough opportunities in Singapore

<ICE-SIN:S2A-042#112:3:C>
Your bit <unclear> word </unclear> will grow but I think we're
growing more brighter people with greater expectations you know with you know
higher educational levels then you know there are jobs for offer

<ICE-SIN:S2A-042#113:3:C>
What's the government trying to say now Civil Service

<ICE-SIN:S2A-042#114:3:C>
Head count they're holding head counts right

<ICE-SIN:S2A-042#115:3:C>
If they're holding head counts they will tell you operation base
is going to increase

<ICE-SIN:S2A-042#116:3:C>
So the Civil Service will continue to take in the bright but only
the very very brightest will get in

<ICE-SIN:S2A-042#117:3:C>
Head counts are not going to increase significantly

<ICE-SIN:S2A-042#118:3:C>
Private sector domestic business in Singapore how far more can we
go

<ICE-SIN:S2A-042#119:3:C>
We're already maturing four we'll have to settle down to about
four to five per cent growth and we would be very lucky over the next maybe
you know twenty years or so

<ICE-SIN:S2A-042#120:3:C>
Where does it present all these bright young people that are
coming onto the market place

<ICE-SIN:S2A-042#121:3:C>
You got to be entrepreneurial or be prepared to work elsewhere

<ICE-SIN:S2A-042#122:3:C>
So circumstances will change
ICE-SIN:S2A-042#> Disagree with me please

Good point

<ICE-SIN:S2A-042#129:3:C>
A very good point

<ICE-SIN:S2A-042#130:3:C>
I mean you know I'm just to relay you know one of my partners
spoke at the you know the last you know gathering here <X>

<ICE-SIN:S2A-042#X131:3:C>
Steven Phang came by and after his speech apparently some of this
you know students approach him And one student came by with exactly the same
problem you know where do you slot you know an idea into And this student
said that I want to bring in bungee jumping you know I don't know who to
approach </X> </I>
