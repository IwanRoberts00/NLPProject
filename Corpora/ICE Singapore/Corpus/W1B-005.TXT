Dear Woon Boon,

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#2:1>
25-7-92

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#3:1>
Was really thrilled to receive your 3-page letter.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#4:1>
Lectures for my MA programme has already begun.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#5:1>
Phonetics + Socioling are the 2 killers.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#6:1>
For Phonetics, the lecturer gives us a test each session, will choose
7 out of 10 for the 20% CA.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#7:1>
Terror isn't it, sounds like Aristar Tony doesn't it?

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#8:1>
For Socioling, we've got this British lady lecturer, renown for
failing students.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#9:1>
She's such an awful lady, during the 1st session, she started by
telling us that we could fail our CA if we get our referencing wrong!

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#10:1>
My course mates are all mature students in their 30's or 40's + she
is treating us like a bunch of naive students.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#11:1>
Yet to meet the lecturer for Psycholing.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#12:1>
Heard he is from US - a visiting lecturer.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#13:1>
As for Grammar, he is very clear in his explanation and is willing to
negotiate with us as to what we want in our course.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#14:1>
So far, the best.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#15:1>
The saucy news about Alan - is it just a rumour?

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#16:1>
He's got 2 very adorable children.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#17:1>
Won't understand why he is doing that cause that would ultimately
ruin his family.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#18:1>
As for Shelly, his lectures are always profound and difficult to
follow, especially when he goes into logic + Maths.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#19:1>
Just hang in there, at least, you could negotiate with him, just put
on a pathetic look and he'll reward you according to your effort.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#20:1>
Trust me, I've done that b4.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#21:1>
Just show him that you are putting in a lot of effort and going
through a lot of pain to understand his lectures.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#22:1>
Sad to hear that the Eng Service of BPC WA isn't doing too well.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#23:1>
I heard that the congregation holds differing views in some doctrinal
issues.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#24:1>
Well, can only commit the church to the Lord.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#25:1>
I am now preparing + busily rehearsing for a Musical 'Elijah' which
would be held at the SLF auditorium from 1-3 Aug.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#26:1>
Samuel is in it too.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#27:1>
Classes for 1st year NUS students will start on Wed 29/7.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#28:1>
Therefore will be meeting them.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#29:1>
Looking forward too.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#30:1>
I'll be taking 2 groups, one on Weds and another on Fris.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#31:1>
I'll be teaching 6 hrs per wk at NUS.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#32:1>
As for S'pore Poly, I am also taking 2 groups, a total of 4 hrs per
wk.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#33:1>
This is just nice as a lot of intensive reading has to be done for my
MA course.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#34:1>
Please send my warmest wishes to Kevin + Jenny on their wedding.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#35:1>
Incidentally, Ang Shiuh + Chui Hwah are getting married today.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#36:1>
Will be attending their wedding later at Calvary Pandan.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#37:1>
As for your dissertation, I feel you should work on something where
you could get adequate materials from.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#38:1>
Perhaps you should fly back to S'pore because quite a fair bit has
been written on Singlish and dialects.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#39:1>
No my reservist was not OK.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#40:1>
I hate it.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#41:1>
I am trying desperately to get downgraded.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#42:1>
Thank God for seeing me through those 2 wks which seemed like 2
years.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#43:1>
Gotta go.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#44:1>
Take care.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#45:1>

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#46:2>
Dear Woon Boon,

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#47:2>
Thanks for your prompt reply and for filling me as to what's
happening at UWA.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#48:2>
Guess I am quite settled at NUS.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#49:2>
I am beginning to enjoy the courses here.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#50:2>
I've learnt a lot in terms of Phonetics, not through the lectures but
reading.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#51:2>
The lecturer is quite unsystematic, makes you even more confused when
he answers your question and he is also quite obstinate.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#52:2>
He doesn't even give lecture handouts.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#53:2>
Sometimes I wonder whether his lectures are worth going.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#54:2>
Sad to hear that something 'extra' has crept into Alan's life.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#55:2>
I really wonder how anyone could ruin his own happiness - if you've
seen his son's picture, you'll realise how adorable he is - big bright eyes
and a cute smile.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#56:2>
Somehow I get the feeling that the Linguistics Dept is getting less 'personal'
ever since it expanded.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#57:2>
Where has Shelley gone to?

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#58:2>
Although I get quite confused during his lectures I feel that he is
quite lenient when it comes to grading.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#59:2>
Trust him to be the mass media.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#60:2>
I could tell that Shelley can never keep a piece of juicy news to
himself.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#61:2>
How's Jenny + Kevin's wedding?

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#62:2>
When's yours coming?

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#63:2>
Are you coming back to S'pore at the end of the year or only after
convocation?

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#64:2>
Celia should have completed her studies.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#65:2>
I heard from her bro, she went to the East.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#66:2>
How's good old Perth, any changes?

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#67:2>
Praise God, the Elijah musical went on quite well despite some set
back, like the sound system wasn't working well on the 1st night, some
difficulties with the Ministry of Infor and the Arts in terms of licence etc.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#68:2>
A BBQ will be held this Sat and a thanks giving dinner next Fri.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#69:2>
Looks like quite a lot of fun.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#70:2>
Looking forward to meeting up with you again.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#71:2>
Take care.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#72:2>

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#73:3>
Dear Woon Boon,

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#74:3>
Thanks for your card.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#75:3>
It was really a pleasant surprise.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#76:3>
How did the first semester go?

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#77:3>
Any new lecturer?

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#78:3>
Right now ( for the month of June) I am conducting GCE 'O' LEVEL
Intensive Englsih course for RELC.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#79:3>
I am taking 3 classes therefore my working hrs are Mon, Wed, Fri (
9-12, 2-5) Tue, Thur, Sat ( 2-5).

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#80:3>
I can't breathe!

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#81:3>
Thank God that the course ends this Sat ( 27/6).

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#82:3>
Come July, I will be tutoring at NUS, at the Eng Lang Proficiency
Centre.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#83:3>
Ngee Ann Poly and S'pore Poly are offering me some hrs too.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#84:3>
Therefore I am likely to reject one of the 2 Polys.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#85:3>
I think I won't be able to cope.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#86:3>
My time-table for MA ( Eng Lg) is as follows: Mon, Tues, Wed from
6pm-8pm.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#87:3>
Looking forward to meet my students undergrads 1st yr.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#88:3>
In fact, I am rather apprehensive, will I be able to cope?

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#89:3>
Pardon my ignorance, how far North is Derby from Perth?

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#90:3>
Glad to know that Keith's got a job there.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#91:3>
Praise the Lord cause the recession in Australia is really bad.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#92:3>
Has Matthew Sim got a job yet?

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#93:3>
How are the YFers?

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#94:3>
Was there a church camp recently in June?

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#95:3>
How's Pastor Mark & Grace?

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#96:3>
Send my regards to them.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#97:3>
Please send my regards to the YFers.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#98:3>
Have Kevin & Jenny got married yet?

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#99:3>
Send my blessings to them too.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#100:3>
How's Alan and Shelley?

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#101:3>
How's the Honours programme UWA.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#102:3>
Do you have a lot of seminars and presentations?

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#103:3>
How's your brother coping at Murdoch?

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#104:3>
Is he enjoying himself?

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#105:3>
Do write to me and let me know your dissertation topic.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#106:3>
For me it will either be a comparison btw Malay + Chinese students
in the learning of EL or a comparison btw Technical + Arts students in the
learning of EL.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#107:3>
Well, Woon Boon, send my regards to Keith and I hope that the Lord's
blessings will be upon both of you.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#108:3>
Take care.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#109:3>
Please write.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#110:3>
Regards.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#111:3>

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#112:4>
Dear YFers,

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#113:4>
Time flies and I have been back in Singapore for more than a year.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#114:4>
Although 1991 has not been plain sailing, I would like to thank the
Lord for seeing me through, providing His strength, grace and mercy in
difficult times.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#115:4>
The job market at the beginning of 1991 was quite bad, due to the
Gulf crisis.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#116:4>
Nevertheless, the Lord provided me with many tutoring jobs and I was
relief teaching at Jurong Institute, a Pre-U Centre.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#117:4>
I really enjoyed teaching and interacting with young adults, for my
pupils are at least seventeen years old.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#118:4>
In June, despite my tight budget, I was able to visit Hong Kong for
six days.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#119:4>
Thank God for providing financially.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#120:4>
On 1 July 1991, I started lecturing at the Language and
Communications Department of Singapore Polytechnic.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#121:4>
I have students from various departments, such as, Building, Civil,
Electrical and Mechanical Engineering.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#122:4>
I enjoy teaching here ( though some of the students are a pain) and
derive much satisfaction.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#123:4>
Come July this year, I will begin my Master of Arts programme in
English Language at the National University of Singapore.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#124:4>
This is a one year fulltime course with nine units to be completed
and a twentythousand word dissertation to be submitted.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#125:4>
I am now having second thoughts as I feel that this crash course may
kill my interest in the subject.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#126:4>
Therefore, I am seeking the Lord's will as to whether I should
pursue a twoyear Master of Applied Linguistics course at Monash University.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#127:4>
Do keep this item in your prayer list too, as I make this important
decision.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#128:4>
I am now attending Mount Carmel BP Church.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#129:4>
I must say that spiritually I am quite dry, though I do my quiet
time and pray regularly.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#130:4>
My greatest challenge this year is to complete reading the Bible
once.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#131:4>
As the academic year is about to begin, I pray that God will provide
you with intelligence, diligence and wisdom in your study.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#132:4>
May you attain good results so that the name of our Lord may be
glorified.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#133:4>
Love-In-Christ,

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#134:4>
Paul Huang </I>

<I>

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#135:5>
Dear Daniel,

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#136:5>
A thousand apologies to you.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#137:5>
I know I ought to be shot for taking such a long time to write.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#138:5>
But I guess better late than never.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#139:5>
So how are things with you?

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#140:5>
You should be finishing your last lap and I am expecting to see you
in early September.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#141:5>
Please don't disappoint us.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#142:5>
This letter therefore serves as a reminder to you that you ought to
be coming back to Singapore SOON.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#143:5>
As for me I have been terribly busy trying to juggle my time between
work and study.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#144:5>
I am beginning to like what I am doing especially I get to meet new
people.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#145:5>
I met up with Robert and Priscilla of Business Administration
through Bun and managed to get them do a recording for me.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#146:5>
I'll be meeting this PhD student from the Geography Department
together with her cousin tomorrow.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#147:5>
Looking forward to that.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#148:5>
Life in Singapore is pretty much the same.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#149:5>
I have already booked tickets to watch Les Miserables next March and
that cost me a bomb
&dollar;124! 

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#150:5>
Well I told myself if I want to watch it I might as well go
for the best seats, if not forget it.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#151:5>
Met up with Bunny and Sun Leng a couple of weeks ago for lunch.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#152:5>
Bunny wasn't feeling too well last week as he was down with a flu.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#153:5>
As for Sun Leng she commenced work at the Institute of Molecular and
Cell Biology sometime middle of this month.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#154:5>
Should be meeting Bunny and Sun Leng this week or next week for
lunch.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#155:5>
Incidentally, it seems that Dr Peter Wong is performing this
Wednesday on Campus Concert's Discovery Show.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#156:5>
Perhaps Bunny and I should make plans to watch the performance and
then see how 'the man' actually fares.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#157:5>
Takashimaya is opened and the shopping complex is just breathtaking.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#158:5>
Things tend to be very expensive though.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#159:5>
Therefore I have not bought anything from the store yet.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#160:5>
Early next month, Tangs Studio will be opening there.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#161:5>
There is a very exclusive gym within the complex and it costs a bomb
to be a member.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#162:5>
The membership costs a thousand five hundred and monthly
subscription, one hundred dollars.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#163:5>
Wow!!

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#164:5>
Bun has actually signed up for the trial membership which costs him
two hundred for a month.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#165:5>
I guess I would too if I am not working.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#166:5>
He is making full use of the facilities there.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#167:5>
The Presidential election takes place this Saturday therefore it is
a public holiday.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#168:5>
Former Deputy Prime Minister Mr Ong Teng Cheong is one of the two
candidates and I predict that he will actually win.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#169:5>
We'll see.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#170:5>
Well, it seems that I have managed to fill you in about what's
happening in Singapore during your absence.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#171:5>
Do take care and remember your friends in Singapore are all waiting
for your return.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#172:5>
Sayonara.

24 August 1993

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#175:6>
Dearest Edward,

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#176:6>
Was really surprised and thrilled to receive your letter especially
I am not sure whether you have actually forgotten about me.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#177:6>
Well, I am extremely busy especially now that I am working for NUS
and on my Masters as well. <X>

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#X178:6>
Time really flies.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#X179:6>
By the end of this year you'll graduate.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#X180:6>
Glad to know that you're coming to Singapore.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#X181:6>
Will certainly try to meet up with you despite my hectic schedule.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#X182:6>
Are you also here to look for a job?

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#X183:6>
Will you have any difficulty with the immigration department since
you went away to Australia without completing your NS?

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#X184:6>
I am quite shock to learn that Pastor Mark is still in Perth.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#X185:6>
I thought he was supposed to go to Adelaide to assist Reverend
Powell?

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#X186:6>
I heard about his plans to study in the States too, perhaps his
plans didn't work out.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#X187:6>
What's happening to BPCWA?

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#X188:6>
Why did Pastor Peter want to resign?

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#X189:6>
Are you still attending this church?

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#X190:6>
How's the YF there?

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#X191:6>
I'm sure it's not quite the same since we left.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#X192:6>
It must have been a lot more quieter and the group smaller.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#X193:6>
Have you made any new friends there?

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#X194:6>
Sharon and Elaine should be completing their course soon.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#X195:6>
Elaine might have another semester to go as she is repeating some
unit.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#X196:6>
Good to hear from you and let's keep in touch.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#X197:6>
Looking forward to seeing you in about four months' time.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#X198:6>
Take care and God bless.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-005#X199:6>
Love-in-Christ,
