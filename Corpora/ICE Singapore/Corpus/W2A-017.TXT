<h> Introduction </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-017#4:1>
The idea that business has one and only one objective - to maximize
profits - has been the familiar position taken by business managers for a
long time.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-017#5:1>
A contemporary proponent of this classical view is the widely
respected Nobel prize-winning economist Milton Friedman.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-017#6:1>
In the words of Friedman: ...

<ICE-SIN:W2A-017#7:1>
there is one and only one social responsibility of business - to use
its resources and engage in activities designed to increase its profits so
long as it stays within the rules of the game ...

<ICE-SIN:W2A-017#8:1>
Over the years, however, there have been pronounced shifts in the
views of business managers about the " social responsibility of business".

<ICE-SIN:W2A-017#9:1>
There is no consensus on either a definition or the limits of socially
responsible actions, but clearly the concept of business's social
responsibility has been broadened beyond its traditional boundary of profit
maximization.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-017#10:1>
Does this mean, then, that business has social responsibilities?

<ICE-SIN:W2A-017#11:1>
What are the arguments for and against the assumption of social
responsibilities by businesses?

<ICE-SIN:W2A-017#12:1>
What are the actions that businesses can pursue to meet this broader
social role?

<ICE-SIN:W2A-017#13:1>
These and other issues are examined in this chapter.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-017#14:1>
<h> Towards Broader Social Responsibilities </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-017#15:1>
The social role of business is not a new concept.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-017#16:1>
Theoreticians and practitioners have grappled with various aspects of
the " social responsibilities of business".

<ICE-SIN:W2A-017#17:1>
A British management philosopher, Oliver Sheldon, was one of the
early advocates of this concept.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-017#18:1>
Sheldon observed changes in the business and social environment in
the 1920s and 1930s, which led him to question the prevailing management
philosophy of production and profit.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-017#19:1>
He noted the growth of mammoth organizations - corporations, labour
unions, government agencies, etc.- and the attendant problems for management.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-017#20:1>
Sheldon also noticed another, more subtle change, namely, a public
that was increasingly cognizant of the need for more business involvement in
society.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-017#21:1>
A humanistic - production philosophy of management was put forward by
Sheldon; he tried to imbue in managers a concern for the human, and not just
production, aspects of management.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-017#22:1>
The United States also had numerous social responsibility advocates.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-017#23:1>
One view, advanced in the 1920s and 1930s, was that the business
community must use its power and influence to deal with major social
problems.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-017#24:1>
This view asserts that business actions can and should be taken even
though there is no direct relationship with profit.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-017#25:1>
This charity principle underscored the appeal to business to extend
voluntary aid to the poor and needy in society.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-017#26:1>
Henry Ford II was among the advocates of this concept of social
responsibility.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-017#27:1>
The stewardship principle, another viewpoint advanced in the 1930s,
considered business managers as trustees not only of the interests of
stockholders but also of society generally.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-017#28:1>
The decisions taken by business managers affect many people in
society and they are thus expected to act in the interest of all those
affected.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-017#29:1>
Accordingly, business managers must maintain a balance between the
interests of stockholders, employees, customers, suppliers and the general
public.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-017#30:1>
Proponents of this view maintain that, if the various interests are
correctly balanced, the company's overall profits in the long run would be
maximized.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-017#31:1>
John D Rockefeller, Jr., Henry Ford and Frank W Abrams were among the
business leaders who echoed this philosophy.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-017#32:1>
These early ideas about the social responsibilities of business, as
embodied in the charity principle and the stewardship principle, form the
foundation of the modern idea of corporate social responsibility.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-017#33:1>
The Social Responsibility Debate Not everyone, however, agrees with
an enlarged role of business in the social arena.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-017#34:1>
Milton Friedman is arguably the most prominent proponent of a
limited, strictly economic role for business.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-017#35:1>
As noted earlier, Friedman contends that the most socially
responsible role for business is to use resources efficiently, make a profit
and obey the law.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-017#36:1>
To attempt to do more than this is irresponsible.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-017#37:1>
Friedman argues that in a free-enterprise, private property system, a
business manager is an employee of the business and has direct responsibility
to the owners of the business.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-017#38:1>
Stockholders generally want to make as much profit as possible, and
the manager's responsibility is to this.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-017#39:1>
When a manager spends the stockholders' money in the public's
interest and reduces the returns to the stockholders, he is spending their
money without their tacit approval.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-017#40:1>
Similarly, when his social actions drive up business costs, which are
then passed on to consumers through higher prices, he is spending their money
also.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-017#41:1>
In effect then, the socially responsible manager is operating outside
the fiduciary relationship and is committing an illegal act.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-017#42:1>
Another offshoot of Friedman's argument is that when socially
responsible manager moves further away from the simple rule of profit
maximization into the social and political realm, he may not really know what
social responsibilities he ought to take on in the public interest.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-017#43:1>
Closely related to this argument is the view that the business
manager should not try to determine what is in the public interest because
they may actually be serving their own narrow interests and not those of the
larger group of stakeholders.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-017#44:1>
Theodore Levitt has added another dimension to this argument when he
expressed his concern that the values of prominent business managers may come
to dominate the values of society: ...

<ICE-SIN:W2A-017#45:1>
there is more than a contingent probability that, with all its
resounding good intentions, business statemanship may create the corporate
equivalent of the unitary state...The corporation would eventually invest
itself with all-embracing duties, obligations, and finally powers -
ministering to the whole man and moulding him and society in the image of the
corporation's narrow ambitions and its essentially unsocial needs.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-017#46:1>
Other arguments frequently advanced against business's social
involvement include the following: One view is that business managers do not
necessarily possess the requisite skills to deal with social problems.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-017#47:1>
These managers may be competent in business - related areas such as
production, marketing, finance, and so on, but special social skills are
required to resolve problems such as crime and conflict in the community.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-017#48:1>
Often, the point is also made that a business which adds to its cost
by assuming social responsibilities, penalizes itself.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-017#49:1>
To illustrate, a business may be prepared to maintain higher
pollution standards, or install more safety equipment, or conduct more
stringent pre-market testing of its products than is required by law.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-017#50:1>
Suppose its competitors are not as socially responsible.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-017#51:1>
In situations like this, the socially responsible firm may actually
place its own competitive position in jeopardy.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-017#52:1>
There are also strong arguments on the other side of the debate.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-017#53:1>
Many business leaders accept the argument that corporations operate
under franchise from public opinion and when society's expectation change, so
should the corporation's actions.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-017#54:1>
Business operates within a set of norms and constraints which are not
only economic but also technological, political and social.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-017#55:1>
These are powerful influences, and business managers must,
instinctively, respond to these influences in their decisionmaking process in
order to operate sucessfully.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-017#56:1>
In short, these managers realize that social responsibility and
success go hand in hand.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-017#57:1>
Business managers also recognize that as a business expands, its
impact on the community increases and the public invariably takes more notice
of its activities.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-017#58:1>
Large businesses have more public visibility.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-017#59:1>
These business managers recognize the value of positive images for
themselves and for business in the public mind.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-017#60:1>
Often, this leads to corporate contributions to charitable,
educational, cultural and other community programmes.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-017#61:1>
Many business leaders, as concerned citizens, also participate in
community affairs.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-017#62:1>
These business people often have strong personal drives to serve
their community and may welcome the opportunity to participate in social
action programmes.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-017#63:1>
The argument that business has social responsibilities was given
another perspective in the 1971 policy statement of the Committee for
Economic Development, a group of influential businessmen:

<ICE-SIN:W2A-017#64:1>
it is in the enlightened self-interest of corporation to promote the
public welfare in a positive way ...

<ICE-SIN:W2A-017#65:1>
because people who have a good environment, education, and
opportunity make better employees, customers, and neighbours for business
than those who are poor, ignorant, and oppressed.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-017#66:1>
As an added dimension to this argument, various commentators have
argued that business managers cannot effectively discharge their long
responsibilities to their stockholders unless they behave responsibly towards
the employees, customers, suppliers and other stakeholder groups The ability
of these managers to protect and enhance the stockholders' equity depends
crucially upon the prosperity, goodwill and confidence of the larger
community.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-017#67:1>
As such, it is clearly in the corporation's best interest to assume
greater social responsibility towards its larger community of stakeholders.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-017#68:1>
Business managers also recognize that if they do not step up their
involvement, the government will be pressurized to step in.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-017#69:1>
They correctly reason that the more businesses respond to societal
pressures, the less pressurized the government will feel to regulate their
business activities.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-017#70:1>
Regulations often add more to business costs than the costs of
programmes.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-017#71:1>
Regulations also restrict the flexibility of business in responding
to market competition.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-017#72:1>
Thus, if business by its own socially responsible actions can head
off new government regulations, it is advancing its own interests.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-017#73:1>
Furthermore, if business steps up its social responsibilities, it
will retain a needed credibility with the public and will be invited to, not
restrained from, participating in the public policy decision - making
process.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-017#74:1>
As pointed out by Melvin Anshen:

<ICE-SIN:W2A-017#75:1>
There can be no greater danger than to permit the new rules to be
formulated by either a small group of critics armed only with malevolence
toward the existing system or the much large group sincerely motivated by
concern for ameliorating social ills but grossly handicapped by their
ignorance of the technique and dynamics of private enterprise.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-017#76:1>
The corollary is that if business volunteers its services only after
its resistance to change has been overcome by overwhelming public pressure,
it may be denied participation when the rules of the game are being written
for business.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-017#77:1>
The above are some of the core ideas on why businesses should assume
social responsibilities.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-017#78:1>
In addition, it is sometimes argued that businesses possess much
social power which must be balanced by an equal amount of social
responsibility.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-017#79:1>
This is based on the so-called Iron Law of Responsibility which
maintains that those who do not use power in ways that society considers
responsible will lose it in the long run.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-017#80:1>
Another argument that is often put forward is that business is
innovative and creative so why not take advantage of this capability in the
social and economic arena?

<ICE-SIN:W2A-017#81:1>
As Kenneth Andrews pointed out: .

<ICE-SIN:W2A-017#82:1>
corporate executives of the calibre, integrity, intelligence, and
humanity required to run substantial companies cannot be expected to confine
themselves to their narrow economic activity and to ignore its social
consequences.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-017#83:1>
There are many sound arguments from both sides of the social
responsibility debate.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-017#84:1>
Obviously, neither side has all the right answers.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-017#85:1>
It is important to be open-minded about the different viewpoints and
to recognize that what works well in one situation might not work in another
at all.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-017#86:1>
Social Responsibility: Strategies of Response Today's professional
business managers are undoubtedly more involved in social action programmes
than was the case a decade ago.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-017#87:1>
There is, however, no broad-based social pressure for every business
to assume all the programmes that society " demands".

<ICE-SIN:W2A-017#88:1>
Businesses are not expected to do everything, although the pressure
is mainly brought to bear on the larger business.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-017#89:1>
Businesses, large and small, can still pick and choose those socially
responsible actions they wish to take.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-017#90:1>
Small firms tend to wait until social responsibility issues arise
before doing anything about them.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-017#91:1>
Their strategy is to wait and see what everyone else in the industry
is doing, before action is taken.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-017#92:1>
They rely on a " follow-the-leader" strategy.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-017#93:1>
Most small firms have few social responsibility problems.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-017#94:1>
They are normally not the target for anti-trust suits from government
agencies or expensive lawsuits from consumer groups.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-017#95:1>
Small firms generally do not spend much time and money on social
responsibility planning by simply employing a reactive strategy.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-017#96:1>
Intermediate-sized firms anticipate what is going to happen in the
environment.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-017#97:1>
They recognize that they are too small to influence any major segment
of the environment. <X>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-017#X98:1>
However, they know that they are too large to avoid the impact of
major changes in the environment.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-017#X99:1>
Intermediate sized firms typically draw up plans that are
contingency-based; that is, the competition adopts strategy A, then they will
counter with strategy B.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-017#X100:1>
This is also a characteristic of their social responsibility
planning.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-017#X101:1>
Intermediate-sized firms will anticipate changes in public opinions
and legislations, but their approach is very much of the " wait-and-see"
variety.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-017#X102:1>
These firms will observe the responses of the large firms to social
change before implementing their own contingency plans.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-017#X103:1>
Large firms generally pursue a proactive strategy.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-017#X104:1>
These firms seek to influence their environment and plan
accordingly.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-017#X105:1>
They know that they are the most likely to be questioned about
their social programmes, and they put in considerable effort to develop their
social action programmes. </X> </I>
