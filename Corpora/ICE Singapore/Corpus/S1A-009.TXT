<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-009#11:1:B>
Okay

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-009#12:1:A>
And I thought you're the one with the problem

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-009#13:1:B>
Actually uh I need to go down because uhm I need to go down
earlier because I need to drop my brother's uhm

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-009#14:1:A>
Mug shot

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-009#15:1:B>
CID stuff you know with all his fingerprints

<ICE-SIN:S1A-009#16:1:B>
So maybe I don't know

<ICE-SIN:S1A-009#17:1:B>
Do you do you feel like going down earlier too

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-009#18:1:A>
Can no problem

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-009#19:1:B>
Cos it's at it's at Maxwell Road

<ICE-SIN:S1A-009#20:1:B>
It's pretty near I think

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-009#21:1:A>
Uhm what do you you

<ICE-SIN:S1A-009#22:1:A>
you just have to drop it or you have to go just see the guy

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-009#23:1:B>
Just drop it ya but I've to call them first because the last
time they gave me such a hard time

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-009#24:1:A>
Why

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-009#25:1:B>
He wanted to know if it was male or female and then if I when
I asked him for another one he said oh what do you want it for

<ICE-SIN:S1A-009#26:1:B>
You know

<ICE-SIN:S1A-009#27:1:B>
So I said Oh just in case I lose it

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-009#28:1:A>
Ya but why do you have to call them

<ICE-SIN:S1A-009#29:1:A>
I mean

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-009#30:1:B>
Because it says on the form ninth to twelfth

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-009#31:1:A>
Ah

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-009#32:1:B>
But when I called earlier at about one something she said the
office opens again at two

<ICE-SIN:S1A-009#33:1:B>
So if they close at five then maybe I can drop it there you see

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-009#34:1:A>
Oh

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-009#35:1:B>

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-009#36:1:A>
Nine to twelve

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-009#37:1:B>

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-009#38:1:A>

<ICE-SIN:S1A-009#40:1:A>
Then I mean you can do all by yourself

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-009#41:1:B>

Uhm

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-009#225:1:A>

<ICE-SIN:S1A-009#226:1:A>
But I don't know I mean aiyah

<ICE-SIN:S1A-009#227:1:A>
I don't know I don't know whether I should take it all there

<ICE-SIN:S1A-009#228:1:A>

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-009#229:1:B>
Uhm ya

<ICE-SIN:S1A-009#230:1:B>
Okay

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-009#231:1:A>
But the thing is we really have to find out you know whether
uhm it can be extended because then we can think about whether we want to buy
the Eurail or the Britrail or what rail

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-009#232:1:B>
Ya ya

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-009#233:1:A>

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-009#234:1:B>
I'd like to cycle in Amsterdam

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-009#235:1:A>
You know your bikes will get stolen

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-009#236:1:B>

<ICE-SIN:S1A-009#237:1:B>
They only have a six-month lifespan

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-009#238:1:A>
Probably less now

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-009#239:1:B>
before it changes owners

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-009#240:1:A>
And uhm yesterday Utta told me it takes six hours to drive
from uh just outside Hanover to Calais

<ICE-SIN:S1A-009#241:1:A>

<ICE-SIN:S1A-009#253:1:B>
Uh ya

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-009#254:1:A>
if we could do it that way but

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-009#255:1:B>
Ya you know what

<ICE-SIN:S1A-009#256:1:B>
I was I meant to tell you this uh

<ICE-SIN:S1A-009#257:1:B>
Do you think uh I should knuckle down and learn how to drive a
stit- shift car

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-009#258:1:A>
Oh it's not six hours Jacky

<ICE-SIN:S1A-009#259:1:A>
It's longer

<ICE-SIN:S1A-009#260:1:A>
Huh Stit-shift

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-009#261:1:B>
Uh

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-009#262:1:A>
Uh

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-009#263:1:B>
Because is it cheaper to rent a stit-shift there uh

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-009#264:1:A>
I don't know

<ICE-SIN:S1A-009#265:1:A>
Never rented any thing others

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-009#266:1:B>
Because if it is then I'm going to learn now

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-009#267:1:A>
Really

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-009#268:1:B>
Ya

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-009#269:1:A>
Which car are you going to bash up Jacky

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-009#270:1:B>
Any one nuh

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-009#271:1:A>
Oh ya

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-009#272:1:B>
I'm not picky

<ICE-SIN:S1A-009#273:1:B>
What do you think uh

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-009#274:1:A>
Ya go ahead

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-009#275:1:B>
Or maybe I should uhm just rent an automatic

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-009#276:1:A>
The thing is I I I don't know

<ICE-SIN:S1A-009#277:1:A>
You know I haven't

<ICE-SIN:S1A-009#278:1:A>
Maybe we should go down and get some brochures from the course

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-009#279:1:B>
Ya

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-009#280:1:A>
Because I can't remember whether it's cheaper to to take a
train and then you know grab a bus or something

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-009#281:1:B>
I like to take train because you meet all sorts of people in
them

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-009#282:1:A>
Ya or to <unclear> word </unclear> drive

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-009#283:1:B>
<unclear> word </unclear> you know you can share food and get
to know them and who knows what might happen

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-009#284:1:A>
Ya true true

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-009#285:1:B>
Ya

<ICE-SIN:S1A-009#286:1:B>
So we need to work it out lah

<ICE-SIN:S1A-009#287:1:B>
Rail versus car

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-009#288:1:A>
Ya but the but I think the the good thing about the car is
you know you just you have your bags in your car and your <unclear> word
</unclear> you know everything with you

<ICE-SIN:S1A-009#289:1:A>
You don't

<ICE-SIN:S1A-009#290:1:A>
you don't really have to dump them anywhere and I I mean the UK is
no problem driving so

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-009#291:1:B>
Ya and then we can send like postcard to Brenda
