<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-030#1:1:A>
Anymore people coming in

<ICE-SIN:S2A-030#2:1:A>
Uhm where should we start today

<ICE-SIN:S2A-030#3:1:A>
Now from the from novel to stage uh from novel to stage

<ICE-SIN:S2A-030#4:1:A>
Uhm uh let me just say first that I have I've had only one
experience of doing this

<ICE-SIN:S2A-030#5:1:A>
So you know I'm an authority as such uh because I don't spend my
whole uh theatre career translating or tra transforming

<ICE-SIN:S2A-030#6:1:A>
I use the word the term translating books into plays alright

<ICE-SIN:S2A-030#7:1:A>
Uh very often uh I I I start my work from a from a playwright's work
or uh just from the actors

<ICE-SIN:S2A-030#8:1:A>
Uh in fact I very seldom uh uh write stuff myself

<ICE-SIN:S2A-030#9:1:A>
Even when I translate from a novel to to stage from book to a stage
the one experience I had I worked primarily with actors to create this
experience okay

<ICE-SIN:S2A-030#10:1:A>
Uhm what do you all think is the primarily difference between a
novel or a book and a stage

<ICE-SIN:S2A-030#11:1:A>
Any volunteers

<ICE-SIN:S2A-030#12:1:A>
Because once we understand the difference we'll be able to zero in
on what exactly uhm we have to do in in this translation

<ICE-SIN:S2A-030#13:1:A>
Right let's look at those uh points

<ICE-SIN:S2A-030#14:1:A>
Uhm I think that straight away one of the one of the uh the the
first speaker talked about uh the fact that in uh uh in a in a performance

<ICE-SIN:S2A-030#15:1:A>
Okay I would say that the novel the primary difference first of all
is that novel is a written piece of work

<ICE-SIN:S2A-030#16:1:A>
It's text while stage of course is performance

<ICE-SIN:S2A-030#17:1:A>
Uh we're we're not talking about about translating from a a novel
into a into a play

<ICE-SIN:S2A-030#18:1:A>
We're trans for trans for talking about translation from novel into
the stage which which means performance

<ICE-SIN:S2A-030#19:1:A>
And uh immediately it involves an audience

<ICE-SIN:S2A-030#20:1:A>
I mean you don't get a situation of of three hundred and sixty
people reading from one giant book right

<ICE-SIN:S2A-030#21:1:A>
I mean reading is a very private experience in a sense that it's a
one-to-one relationship with the with the book

<ICE-SIN:S2A-030#22:1:A>
Uh while in a in a theatre you have to think about the audience uhm
and about the communion between what's happening on stage and what's
happening in the audience

<ICE-SIN:S2A-030#23:1:A>
Okay the the the the the reason why I use the word communion is
that it's important to relate to the audience

<ICE-SIN:S2A-030#24:1:A>
It's not it's not going to be uh enough of a threatrical experience
if the actor son stage uh uh uh only relating to themselves and there's
nothing no no energy flowing out towards the audience

<ICE-SIN:S2A-030#25:1:A>
While in a sense for a book it's very different

<ICE-SIN:S2A-030#26:1:A>
I mean the novelist writes the book and he doesn't have to have any
potent energy jumping up from the book uh into into the reader's uh uh uh uh
into into the reader's feel/field as such

<ICE-SIN:S2A-030#27:1:A>
So immediately we come to one main difference in that theatre has
to have a dynamism okay

<ICE-SIN:S2A-030#28:1:A>
The stage has to have a dynamism that means that it cannot be a a a
uhm a an experience of just of just uh uh imbibing the atmosphere

<ICE-SIN:S2A-030#29:1:A>
It has to be a three dimensional experience uh which is immediately
another difference between the book which is two dimensional and theatre
which is three dimensional because you have uh uh the actors you have the
three dimensional sets etcetera etcetera

<ICE-SIN:S2A-030#30:1:A>
Uhm one of you brought up also that it's about it's not just not
about thoughts it's also about action okay

<ICE-SIN:S2A-030#31:1:A>
A primary definition of theatre uh in the olden times okay uh the
the uh uh from the Greek times is that it only needs three elements fro
theatre

<ICE-SIN:S2A-030#32:1:A>
One is that you need a a a a space okay and uh by a space what is
define as space you can just use a chalk to draw up a square on a floor and
that is your performance space

<ICE-SIN:S2A-030#33:1:A>
Two you need actors uh uh uh with finally three a conflict okay

<ICE-SIN:S2A-030#34:1:A>
So you need actors uh relating in terms of actions

<ICE-SIN:S2A-030#35:1:A>
And number three you need a conflict between the actors okay

<ICE-SIN:S2A-030#36:1:A>
That's all you need to create a play

<ICE-SIN:S2A-030#37:1:A>
So you can just have a situation where man A meets man B in a space
and uh uh they have uh uh different views about life

<ICE-SIN:S2A-030#38:1:A>
And from there the clash you know develops and then a piece of
theatre can happen okay

<ICE-SIN:S2A-030#39:1:A>
Uh and so in a sense theatre is about action and not just about
thoughts

<ICE-SIN:S2A-030#40:1:A>
Theatre is a is a is a playing out of thoughts uhm and the the the
the key word the third key word there conflict also relates to dynamism
because you can only by dynamic when there is a conflict right okay

<ICE-SIN:S2A-030#41:1:A>
Uh do you understand what I mean by dynamism meaning that uh you
can't really have a a a play in which nothing happens

<ICE-SIN:S2A-030#42:1:A>
I mean you can of course

<ICE-SIN:S2A-030#43:1:A>
I mean that's that's an experimental

<ICE-SIN:S2A-030#44:1:A>
Well because I myself have done something like that where where
nothing really happens Backette?? for example

<ICE-SIN:S2A-030#45:1:A>
Okay where nothing really happens

<ICE-SIN:S2A-030#46:1:A>
Uh but within that silence or within the emptiness something is
happening that means that you're you're you're you're looking at at uh uh an
action happening within space zero or time zero okay

<ICE-SIN:S2A-030#47:1:A>
Uhm and going back to the the the term dynamism and conflict uhm we
cannot simply in a sense have people sitting on stage unless you're
interested in looking at spatial arrangements and lights and bodies moving in
the light

<ICE-SIN:S2A-030#48:1:A>
That means it becomes a kind of kind of dance ritual or movement
ritual okay right

<ICE-SIN:S2A-030#49:1:A>
While in a book like in Thomas Hardy famous for pages and pages of
scenic description appear on the countryside

<ICE-SIN:S2A-030#50:1:A>
But you can't really do that in uh uh uh on stage because there
isn't any dynamism alright

<ICE-SIN:S2A-030#51:1:A>
You can you you you can create that panorama of scenery in a film
for example and <unclear> word </unclear> with with music you know it can be
a a a a a a wondrous experience like for example uh uh Merchant <unclear>
word </unclear> Ivory's <unclear> word </unclear> films

<ICE-SIN:S2A-030#52:1:A>
Uh it's it's very much that he always rolls as to pan his camera
through the the countryside

<ICE-SIN:S2A-030#53:1:A>
And then there is music and you and you and the au the the the the
film goer is left to the sense of what just happen in that last scene

<ICE-SIN:S2A-030#54:1:A>
In a sense you you you have time to to view the scenery and almost
look at the last scene happening between Vanessa Redgrave and uh uh and
whoever uh in a diff different perspective okay

<ICE-SIN:S2A-030#55:1:A>
But in in theatre it's very very difficult because it's life

<ICE-SIN:S2A-030#56:1:A>
And so if you actually do uh uh uh moments like that you're going
to start to have a restless audience or pockets of restlessness uh happening
okay

<ICE-SIN:S2A-030#57:1:A>
So uh we're talking about dynamism we're talking about conflict
we're talking about action uhm

<ICE-SIN:S2A-030#58:1:A>
And uh in relation to what some of you some of the rest of you
brought about soliloquies

<ICE-SIN:S2A-030#59:1:A>
Uh well in in film also you can also have a soliloquy

<ICE-SIN:S2A-030#60:1:A>
You can have a voice over like in uh uh the translation of Tennesse
William's uh play into the movie

<ICE-SIN:S2A-030#61:1:A>
I think John Malkerwech?? was talking all the time as the as the
brother and he was he was having a solliloquy while uh uh the the movie was
moving on okay

<ICE-SIN:S2A-030#62:1:A>
Uhm and also in a in in a book you you also have solliloquies
happening because it's a personal uh it's a personal impression of let's say
what happened in in Cornwall alright or in the uh in in the Devonshire
alright

<ICE-SIN:S2A-030#63:1:A>
And he's writing the whole chapter so that's already a kind of
solliloquy

<ICE-SIN:S2A-030#64:1:A>
Uhm it's that clear up to this point

<ICE-SIN:S2A-030#65:1:A>
Okay now the theatre being a visual experience

<ICE-SIN:S2A-030#66:1:A>
Okay that's that's uh uh uh extremely important because in
yesterday's session with with the the the secondary students I talked about
the uh uh uh key words of immediacy the magic of the moment

<ICE-SIN:S2A-030#67:1:A>
Okay that theatre is all about immediacy

<ICE-SIN:S2A-030#68:1:A>
You must have something happening there and then the emotion must
be real the emotion must be true and it cannot be it cannot be something
which you can cut and refilm alright

<ICE-SIN:S2A-030#69:1:A>
So you must have the immediacy and the magic of the moment and
hence theatre must be vivid

<ICE-SIN:S2A-030#70:1:A>
It it's a whole immediate moment where as the audience who sit
there and you you either washed over with emotions which are so powferable??
because of what's happening on stage between two characters or you're washed
over by the visual experience okay it's

<ICE-SIN:S2A-030#71:1:A>
So theatre or stage is an experiential uh uh uh experience

<ICE-SIN:S2A-030#72:1:A>
It's it's it's exactly that you see while in a sense and is of all
senses

<ICE-SIN:S2A-030#73:1:A>
It's it's the play touching all senses sight sound uh sometimes you
may have incense in a in a small black box smell uh uh uh uh uh uh all your
senses all being stimulated while in a in a book it's different okay

<ICE-SIN:S2A-030#74:1:A>
Uhm we walked some of you talked as well about how uh between a
book uh and also a a stage experience there is personal space for the for the
audience member

<ICE-SIN:S2A-030#75:1:A>
What do I mean by personal space

<ICE-SIN:S2A-030#76:1:A>
Meaning that when you read the book you can make your you you can
sort of stop reading for a while and just close your eyes and imagine what's
happening in a chapter

<ICE-SIN:S2A-030#77:1:A>
Uh but you can also do that in a theatre experience in a sense that
you make up your mind as to what's happening on stage

<ICE-SIN:S2A-030#78:1:A>
Uh but there are many plays like some of the plays that I do which
are extremely aggressive

<ICE-SIN:S2A-030#79:1:A>
That means there's no time for you to for you the audience to uh to
stop and uh and reflect

<ICE-SIN:S2A-030#80:1:A>
But you're you're constantly pounded by what's happening on stage

<ICE-SIN:S2A-030#81:1:A>
But a theatre experience can also be such that the director designs
it such that there is space for the audience to breathe and to think about
what has happen okay alright

<ICE-SIN:S2A-030#82:1:A>
Uh anyone else brought up points which is not address

<ICE-SIN:S2A-030#83:1:A>
Yes of course that if you're a writer who's very concerned that
your every word every feeling must be exact

<ICE-SIN:S2A-030#84:1:A>
Then I recommend that you write a novel instead of a play because
uh the the primary creation

<ICE-SIN:S2A-030#85:1:A>
Okay this is a this is a a a an old view okay and I'm I'm just
talking about the the the old view

<ICE-SIN:S2A-030#86:1:A>
The primary creative of drama comes from the writer and the
secondary creativity comes from the director and actor alright

<ICE-SIN:S2A-030#87:1:A>
So that if you are very very uh uh jealous about your work you
mustn't write a play because finally the play goes to a group of people who
work on your text as a basic starting point

<ICE-SIN:S2A-030#88:1:A>
So what you may have intented is transformed uh into something else
alright okay

<ICE-SIN:S2A-030#89:1:A>
Because there are many ways of uh of of of looking at it

<ICE-SIN:S2A-030#90:1:A>
I mean a director and a group of actors can say that yes I am
keeping to the playwright's intention but within this specific moment I can
interpret action A instead of action B and still be within the playwright's
intention okay alright

<ICE-SIN:S2A-030#91:1:A>
Do you all understand what I am saying

<ICE-SIN:S2A-030#92:1:A>
That once you write a play you have other elements coming in
because the the actors are not machines they're not robots they're not
programmed to think like you

<ICE-SIN:S2A-030#93:1:A>
You may have intended a a a certain motivation to result in a
certain action but uh the actor can reach that action with a different
motivation because they're not robots and they're not programmed by you while
in a novel you can do exactly that because no one else is going touch your
your your your book

<ICE-SIN:S2A-030#94:1:A>
Once it's printed as a novel everyone reads it as it is right while
once a play is printed that's only part of the process </I>
