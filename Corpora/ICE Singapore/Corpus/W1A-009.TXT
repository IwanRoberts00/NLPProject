Question: Given the stable environment enjoyed by Singaporeans, the
end of Cold War and good relations with neighbouring countries, it is
increasingly difficult to convince the population on the need to continue
spending 6 per cent GDP and maintaining two and half years National Service.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-009#2:1>
<h> INTRODUCTION </h>

<ICE-SIN:W1A-009#3:1>
The end of Cold War has created conditions that has given cause for
some optimism.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-009#4:1>
The United Nations has emerged as a strengthened organisation,
exemplified by its actions during the Gulf War of 1991, in its relief efforts
in Somalia and in finding a solution to the Cambodian conflict.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-009#5:1>
In Afghanistan, the Najibullahs and Mujahideens, who were aided by
United States and the former Soviet Union respectively, are working towards a
resolution to end civil wars.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-009#6:1>
In the Middle East, the Arabs and the Israelis are negotiating for a
peaceful settlement.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-009#7:1>
In South East Asia ( SEA), significant progress has been made towards
a peaceful solution, after a lapse of 12 years, on the Cambodian issue.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-009#8:1>
Even Vietnam, with the termination of aid from the former Soviet
Union, has decided to come to terms with China and the rest of the world.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-009#9:1>
As a result, tensions, anxieties, mistrust and general suspicion
between blocs and among countries have been substantially reduced.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-009#10:1>
In Singapore, the threat of communism has subsided and external
relations with its two immediate neighbours, Indonesia and Malaysia, have
strengthened.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-009#11:1>
The construction of the second causeway between Singapore and
Malaysia and joint economic developments with Indonesia under the " Growth
Triangle" initiative has resulted in a greater interdependence among the
three nations.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-009#12:1>
Apart from this, Singapore has many layers of security should it be
under seige by an aggressor.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-009#13:1>
The bilateral treaties with its neighbours and the United States and
the Five Power Defence Arrangements ensure that the sovereignty of Singapore
will be guarded.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-009#14:1>
In the light of these developments, Singaporeans have questioned the
need to continue spending 6 per cent of the GDP on defence and the need to
have two and half years of national service.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-009#15:1>
They argue that more funds need to be channelled to education and
health and that a one year national service system ( like the Swiss system)
should be adopted.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-009#16:1>
They also believed that this would help to relieve the current
manpower shortages in the private and public sector.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-009#17:1>
While the international and domestic conditions may bring political
stability and peace, the euphoria that the world is going to be a harmonious
place in every corner will not be realised.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-009#18:1>
In an article entitled " Secret Warriors" in the 17 June 91 issue of
Time magazine predicted that with the end of Cold War, future wars are likely
to be small wars in the Third World.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-009#19:1>
Indeed, the bulk of the territorial disputes in Asia have yet to be
amicably resolved and the South China Sea remains an area of potential
conflict.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-009#20:1>
Besides this, the arms race among the Asian states has intensified
because of doubts about the military commitment of the United States in the
region due its domestic problems and the proposed budget cuts in US defence.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-009#21:1>
Already, the great and medium military powers in Asia such as China,
India and Japan have become nuclear powers.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-009#22:1>
North Korea, South Korea and Indonesia may soon be joining the ranks.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-009#23:1>
Apart from this, the removal of ideological confrontation between
democracy and communism after the Cold War, has unmasked other tensions.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-009#24:1>
In Europe, these tensions have been manifested in the break-up of the
Soviet Union and civil wars in Yugoslavia.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-009#25:1>
In China, it led to the bloody Tiananmen massacre of students by the
military.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-009#26:1>
<h> AIM OF PAPER </h>

<ICE-SIN:W1A-009#27:1>
The aim of this paper is two fold.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-009#28:1>
The first is to explore the reasons to why is there a need to
maintain an expenditure of 6 percent of GDP for defence and as to why
Singapore cannot afford to lower the duration for national service.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-009#29:1>
The other aim is to identify arguments that could be used to justify
the continued emphasis on defence.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-009#30:1>
In exploring the above areas, the paper will briefly focus on the
threat perceptions and Singapore's defence policy, the security situation and
the arms race in SEA which necessitate a strong deterrent strategy, total
defence and the role of the military, military industries and the economy and
the need to maintain the current duration of National Service.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-009#31:1>
The other part of the paper focuses on the present and potential
strategies that MINDEF ( Ministry of Defence) could use to justify the
emphasis on defence.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-009#32:1>
The paper uses the two issues of defence expenditure and national
service in its analysis.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-009#33:1>
<h> THREAT PERCEPTIONS AND DEFENCE POLICY </h> In order to understand
the defence policy of Singapore, one has to look into the strategic
environment and threat perceptions of the island state.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-009#34:1>
The most obvious vulnerability is the smallness of Singapore which is
a mere 621 kilometres in size.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-009#35:1>
As such, it does not have the strategic depth which is required for
our forces to withdraw to the rear to revitalize itself and stage a counter
attack on the invaders.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-009#36:1>
In Singapore's case, the front will also be its rear.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-009#37:1>
In this sense, the loss of the city means loss of the nation.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-009#38:1>
Compounding the problem is the fact of geography.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-009#39:1>
Singapore is located in close proximity to its neighbours'
territorial waters and at the crossroads of major sea lanes of communication
between the Indian Ocean and the South China Sea.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-009#40:1>
Thus, there is a need for her to protect her sovereignty and her
maritime interests.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-009#41:1>
The third factor confronting Singapore is that of its limited
population.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-009#42:1>
This is a serious constraint to the build-up of the defence forces
and precludes the establishment of a large standing army.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-009#43:1>
The fourth factor is the ethnic mix of Singapore.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-009#44:1>
The issue of " Malay loyalty" in the event of an external conflict
and overwhelming Chinese population in Singapore, which may add to the image
of " Third China" to the perception of its immediate neighbours, have been an
impediment to closer relations between Singapore and its immediate
neighbours.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-009#45:1>
Political subversion is yet another threat which continues to reflect
in the internal perception of the government.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-009#46:1>
But the absence of any serious challenge to internal security has
diminished this threat to a certain extent.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-009#47:1>
The defence policy of Singapore is moulded by its perceived threats.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-009#48:1>
First, it relies on adroit diplomacy to encourage a favourable
balance of friendly external forces in the region.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-009#49:1>
In this regard, it encourages the military presence of the US in SEA
as a counterweight to the medium powers in the region.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-009#50:1>
Secondly, it emphasises development, economic growth and
nation-building to reinforce domestic resilience and national identity.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-009#51:1>
Thirdly, it upgrades conventional military capability to provide
credible defence and deterrence against would-be aggressors.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-009#52:1>
If deterrence and diplomacy fails, the Singapore Armed Forces ( SAF)
are expected to secure a swift and decisive victory over the aggressor.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-009#53:1>
Fourthly, it places the highest premium on cultivating close and
special ties with its immediate neighbours to strengthen mutual confidence.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-009#54:1>
Singapore's threat perceptions are well exemplified by its relatively
high expenditure on defence.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-009#55:1>
In comparison with its ASEAN neighbours in 1990, it was found that
Singapore had allocated the highest proportion of its GDP for defence.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-009#56:1>
In 1990, Singapore allocated 5.1 per cent of its GDP on defence while
its immediate neighbours, Malaysia and Indonesia, allocated 3.8 per cent and
1.5 per cent of their GDPs respectively for defence.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-009#57:1>
In monetary terms, the expenditure of Singapore and its immediate
neighbours were about the same.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-009#58:1>
Singapore spent US&dollar;1.7b on defence while Malaysia and Indonesia spent
US&dollar;1.56b and US&dollar;1.45b respectively.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-009#59:1>
Thailand had the largest military expenditure of US&dollar;2.06b ( see table
1). <X>

<ICE-SIN:W1A-009#63:1>
<h> DEFENCE EXPENDITURE OF SINGAPORE </h>

<ICE-SIN:W1A-009#64:1>
Singapore defence expenditure has remained at 6 percent of its GDP
since the 1970s.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-009#65:1>
It is likely that Singapore will have to maintain this expenditure as
the security situation is still volatile and external ties are fragile.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-009#66:1>
It appears foolhardy to cut defence expenditure or the duration of
national service especially when other ASEAN members are spending more on
defence.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-009#67:1>
In fact, with the withdrawal of the United States from SEA, the "
arms race" among our immediate neighbours has increased.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-009#68:1>
MINDEF believes that 6 percent is the level that is needed yearly in
order to secure the peace we have enjoyed for so long.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-009#69:1>
It is needed for investments in the essential aspects of Singapore's
defence.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-009#70:1>
In the context of Singapore, defence spending is seen as an
investment rather than an expenditure.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-009#71:1>
According to Dr Yeo Ning Hong, the Defence Minister, it is an
investment in the country's security.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-009#72:1>
Dividends for this investment are paid and enjoyed on a daily basis
in terms of peace and security, the foundation for our continued freedom,
economic growth and prosperity.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-009#73:1>
This is manifested by the vast progress Singapore has achieved since
her independence'.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-009#74:1>
He added that the defence expenditure is pegged to 6 per cent so that
it acts as a ceiling for government spending on defence.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-009#75:1>
Any expenditure above 6 per cent would come under close scrutiny by
the Cabinet and the Parliament.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-009#76:1>
Besides, it does not necessarily mean that Singapore would spend the
defence budget allocated.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-009#77:1>
In most years, MINDEF has managed to keep its defence expenditure
below the budget allocated to it.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-009#78:1>
The defence budget of Singapore for the financial year 1992 totalled
&dollar;4 billion.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-009#79:1>
This constitutes about 6.2 per cent of the GDP and is 3.3 times
higher than the defence expenditure of 1974 which was 4.7 per cent of its
GDP.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-009#80:1>
Between 1976 and 1977, the defence expenditure increased because the
SAF embarked on the procurement of expensive hardware for the Army (
vehicles, weapons and signals equipment), Air Force and Navy.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-009#81:1>
For the period of 1984 to 1986, Singapore further embarked on
upgrading its air defence capabilities through the purchase of four E2
Hawkeye reconnaissance aircraft ( costing
&dollar;945 million), the planned acquisition of eight Hawk Fighters (
&dollar;624.4 million) and thirty SIAI-Marchetti trainer and light attack aircraft (
&dollar;130 million).

<ICE-SIN:W1A-009#82:1>
Between 1988 and 1991 defence expenditure hovered at 5 to 6 per cent.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-009#83:1>
The details concerning Singapore's military expenditure for selected
years between 1974 and 1991 are shown in table 2.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-009#84:1>
The three basic components of the 1992 defence expenditure are
capital expenditure which includes purchases of aircraft, ships, tanks,
howitzer guns and small arms, salaries of regulars, national servicemen and
make up pay for reservists and finally operating costs.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-009#85:1>
Singapore has to acquire high technology equipment so that it can be
geared to fight and win future wars.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-009#86:1>
Since the SAF is small and only requires a small number of equipment,
it cannot receive bulk discounts on its purchases.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-009#87:1>
Therefore, it has to spend more relative to other larger armed
forces.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-009#88:1>
The SAF also invest in simulators due to the lack of training grounds
in order to provide realistic training for our servicemen.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-009#89:1>
The second component is that of salaries.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-009#90:1>
With a severe shortage of labour in Singapore, MINDEF has to pay well
to attract the better Singaporeans to join the SAF.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-009#91:1>
The SAF cannot employ mediocre and incompetent people as the risks
involved are high.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-009#92:1>
The final category is that of operating costs.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-009#93:1>
The SAF has to compensate for the constraints of land by training
overseas so that the soldiers have realistic training.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-009#94:1>
This means that it has to incur greater costs in transporting its
troops, equipment and for lease of foreign training areas.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-009#95:1>
For the SAF to be an effective deterrent force against aggression,
manpower and weapons of the SAF should be at their best so that it would be
an effective and modern fighting force despite falling national manpower
resources.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-009#96:1>
<h> SECURITY SITUATION IN SEA </h>

<ICE-SIN:W1A-009#97:1>
Although Cold War has ended, the security situation in the Asia
Pacific region remains volatile and unpredictable.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-009#98:1>
In Myanmar, ethnic turmoil, a repressive regime and a disturbingly
large standing army make the country a source of potential regional
instability.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-009#99:1>
The rise of political opposition to the Junta following the 1988
massacre of pro-democracy demonstrators has added fuel to the long running
war between the government and ethnic minorities along the borders with
Bangladesh, Thailand and China. <X>

<ICE-SIN:W1A-009#X100:1>
In Vietnam, economic reforms have raised expectations that probably
cannot be met so long as the Communist Party retains its political
stronghold.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-009#X101:1>
Hanoi is also haunted by the spectre of unrest among disaffected
military leaders, particularly the South Vietnamese who are disillusioned by
the rule of the North.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-009#X102:1>
In Cambodia, a UN brokered peace accord has broken down and there
is potential for clashes between the Vietnam-backed regime in Phnom Penh and
its main adversary, the Beijing-backed Khmer Rouge.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-009#X103:1>
In the Philippines, political instability persists as result of
communist insurrection and military rivalry.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-009#X104:1>
The economy is also not in a healthy state and this has been
exacerbated by the closing of the US bases. </X> </I>
