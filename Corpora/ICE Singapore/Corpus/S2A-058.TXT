<ICE-SIN:S2A-058#1:1:A>
Good morning everybody

<ICE-SIN:S2A-058#2:1:A>
It's nice to see so many people here today

<ICE-SIN:S2A-058#3:1:A>
I guess when I see so many people here it makes me feel happy
because today what I really aim to do was is to introduce a new hobby to you

<ICE-SIN:S2A-058#4:1:A>
But let me start by telling you that I won't be teaching you or
demonstrating to you how to paint aircraft and military vehicles

<ICE-SIN:S2A-058#5:1:A>
What I'm interested to do here is to show you how are we going to
paint models or figures

<ICE-SIN:S2A-058#6:1:A>
And if you look at my showcase over here you'll see figurines of all
sorts ranging from Aliens Predators Batman the Crow and all sorts of figures

<ICE-SIN:S2A-058#7:1:A>
In fact even Star Wars figures if you noticed

<ICE-SIN:S2A-058#8:1:A>
What I aim to do really is to introduce this new hobby to all of you

<ICE-SIN:S2A-058#9:1:A>
Because it's a hobby that I hold very dearly to my heart

<ICE-SIN:S2A-058#10:1:A>
Since I was very young I've always liked toys that allow me to use
my imagination and creativity to construct them

<ICE-SIN:S2A-058#11:1:A>
That's why I enjoyed playing with Lego and stuff like that

<ICE-SIN:S2A-058#12:1:A>
But as I grew older I realised I want to do more with my hands and
my imagination

<ICE-SIN:S2A-058#13:1:A>
And I started I started painting Airfix model-kits

<ICE-SIN:S2A-058#14:1:A>
Seeing that smiles on your faces I know some of you did that too

<ICE-SIN:S2A-058#15:1:A>
And then later on as I watched movies and grow into like popular
figures and all

<ICE-SIN:S2A-058#16:1:A>
I realised that hey maybe I can paint these figures

<ICE-SIN:S2A-058#17:1:A>
And just let me tell you that at the end of the day when you
finished painting a figure

<ICE-SIN:S2A-058#18:1:A>
You look at it you'll feel extremely happy and a sense of
gratification

<ICE-SIN:S2A-058#19:1:A>
It's extreme and it's wonderful because you have a work of creation
in your own hands

<ICE-SIN:S2A-058#20:1:A>
And today that's what I'm going to teach you

<ICE-SIN:S2A-058#21:1:A>
But I also want to warn you that it may sound very nice if you look
at the showcases and all the works that you see there

<ICE-SIN:S2A-058#22:1:A>
But a lot of people would give up at the beginning stage

<ICE-SIN:S2A-058#23:1:A>
So I wonder how many how many of you here will go on to paint an
actual figure

<ICE-SIN:S2A-058#24:1:A>
But we will see we will see

<ICE-SIN:S2A-058#25:1:A>
Don't worry about this and we will see

<ICE-SIN:S2A-058#26:1:A>
The objectives of this demonstration is to first of all we will
learn I will show you how to prepare a figure to be painted

<ICE-SIN:S2A-058#27:1:A>
And you'll be surprised to know that sometimes that alone takes up
more time than the painting process itself

<ICE-SIN:S2A-058#28:1:A>
Number two we will learn how to paint a figure

<ICE-SIN:S2A-058#29:1:A>
Of course right that's why all of you are here

<ICE-SIN:S2A-058#30:1:A>
We will learn techniques like wet brushing dry brushing techniques
of painting the eyes and other difficult parts of the body

<ICE-SIN:S2A-058#31:1:A>
And even even learning how to use the airbrush

<ICE-SIN:S2A-058#32:1:A>
Then thirdly I'm going to show you how to improvise

<ICE-SIN:S2A-058#33:1:A>
How to make your model your painted model more exciting more alive
by improvising

<ICE-SIN:S2A-058#34:1:A>
Ready any questions

<ICE-SIN:S2A-058#35:1:A>
Good if you have no questions let's go on to my first objective
here is to teach and to demonstrate to you how to prepare a model for
painting

<ICE-SIN:S2A-058#36:1:A>
First of all the materials

<ICE-SIN:S2A-058#37:1:A>
In your course if to need you will need paints

<ICE-SIN:S2A-058#38:1:A>
Paints I will suggest uhm you use Tamiya paints or the Testor
paints

<ICE-SIN:S2A-058#39:1:A>
These are special paints that you use to paint models

<ICE-SIN:S2A-058#40:1:A>
Next brushes

<ICE-SIN:S2A-058#41:1:A>
Brushes can be bought anywhere but you would need all sorts of
brushes

<ICE-SIN:S2A-058#42:1:A>
You need the very thick ones like here

<ICE-SIN:S2A-058#43:1:A>
Let me show you

<ICE-SIN:S2A-058#44:1:A>
And the very very fine ones

<ICE-SIN:S2A-058#45:1:A>
And these fine ones are use for painting very difficult to reach
areas like the eyes little crevices places like that which we'll show you
later

<ICE-SIN:S2A-058#46:1:A>
Now before you can even use the brush and the paint aha you are
going to need this a putty knife

<ICE-SIN:S2A-058#47:1:A>
This is a cutting tool that is very very sharp

<ICE-SIN:S2A-058#48:1:A>
There was once when I was trying to cut off cut off some excess
areas from a figure and I wasn't careful and I sliced through quite a big
piece of my finger off

<ICE-SIN:S2A-058#49:1:A>
Yah and it's still there now but uhm but it's a grim reminder of
the pain I suffered during then

<ICE-SIN:S2A-058#50:1:A>
So you have to be very very careful when you use this cutting knife

<ICE-SIN:S2A-058#51:1:A>
But it's an essential equipment that you need

<ICE-SIN:S2A-058#52:1:A>
Next here we have the putty

<ICE-SIN:S2A-058#53:1:A>
This putty this white stuff over here is very important because
it's used to fill up those spaces

<ICE-SIN:S2A-058#54:1:A>
Uhm let me explain this in another way

<ICE-SIN:S2A-058#55:1:A>
When a model-kit is given to you it never comes in a complete it's
never fully assembled

<ICE-SIN:S2A-058#56:1:A>
So you have to cut off all the excess pieces and assemble them
together

<ICE-SIN:S2A-058#57:1:A>
Now when you assemble them together using the super glue usually
the pieces will not fit snugly or nicely to each other

<ICE-SIN:S2A-058#58:1:A>
So what you need to do is to use the putty put it against the area
that is connecting the two parts smoothen it up by using water and so on

<ICE-SIN:S2A-058#59:1:A>
And then it'll look complete itself

<ICE-SIN:S2A-058#60:1:A>
So this is what a putty is used for okay

<ICE-SIN:S2A-058#61:1:A>
And then we have this interesting powder here

<ICE-SIN:S2A-058#62:1:A>
It's actually a cement model cement

<ICE-SIN:S2A-058#63:1:A>
We use this cement sometimes to improvise to make bases and
sometimes we use it even to fill up the figures

<ICE-SIN:S2A-058#64:1:A>
All the figures that you see they are hollow on the inside because
they are made of vinyl so they are hollow on the inside

<ICE-SIN:S2A-058#65:1:A>
Vinyl would also mean that they are plastic

<ICE-SIN:S2A-058#66:1:A>
So they can be molded in a way

<ICE-SIN:S2A-058#67:1:A>
So if you want your figure to have weight and to retain the shape
forever you'll need to fill up first of all the figures with cement

<ICE-SIN:S2A-058#68:1:A>
When this cement dries up the figure will now have retained its own
shape and it's fully constructed it gives the figure a certain weight

<ICE-SIN:S2A-058#69:1:A>
And it feels it's actually better

<ICE-SIN:S2A-058#70:1:A>
Right any questions at this point with all the equipment

<ICE-SIN:S2A-058#71:1:A>
Good now this equipment here is called the airbrush

<ICE-SIN:S2A-058#72:1:A>
It's a very expensive equipment uh usually costing about about two
three hundreds if you include the that compressor here which is the more
expensive equipment

<ICE-SIN:S2A-058#73:1:A>
Airbrush comes in different grades sometimes they be very cheap
about five six dollars but will never last a lifetime

<ICE-SIN:S2A-058#74:1:A>
What I have here is the Testor brush which is fully guaranteed and
it's very good

<ICE-SIN:S2A-058#75:1:A>
Well if you start this new hobby of yours you don not need to buy
the airbrush at the present moment

<ICE-SIN:S2A-058#76:1:A>
What you can do is that you can use the equipment over here

<ICE-SIN:S2A-058#77:1:A>
I'll usually rent it out at a very cheap rate of five dollars per
hour

<ICE-SIN:S2A-058#78:1:A>
So if you have any questions you can even ask me during the
painting process

<ICE-SIN:S2A-058#79:1:A>
So you don't need to buy this equipment at home unless you feel a
need to

<ICE-SIN:S2A-058#80:1:A>
Any questions

<ICE-SIN:S2A-058#81:1:A>
Alright let's begin

<ICE-SIN:S2A-058#82:1:A>
First thing how do you prepare your figure for painting

<ICE-SIN:S2A-058#83:1:A>
Let me show you

<ICE-SIN:S2A-058#84:1:A>
In this packet here we have a figure of Dr Death from Judge Dread

<ICE-SIN:S2A-058#85:1:A>
This is the figure usually I show uhm to new students on how to
paint a figure

<ICE-SIN:S2A-058#86:1:A>
As you can see the figure when it comes to you they are in
different pieces two legs the body the head and the two hands over here and
you have a base over here

<ICE-SIN:S2A-058#87:1:A>
So the first thing you've to do is to shape is to cut away the
excess plastic of the vinyl that you see around the figures especially at the
ends that need to be connected

<ICE-SIN:S2A-058#88:1:A>
So let me show you how it's being cut

<ICE-SIN:S2A-058#89:1:A>
Notice how careful I am

<ICE-SIN:S2A-058#90:1:A>
To hold the place hold the place hold the figure at right parts

<ICE-SIN:S2A-058#91:1:A>
And be careful of the knife and not shave off excess not shave off
too deeply into the figure itself and especially not to cut your hands and
your fingers

<ICE-SIN:S2A-058#92:1:A>
Right after we do this the next you'll have to do is that you have
to remember this is to put all these pieces into a basin and you wash them
with detergent or soap

<ICE-SIN:S2A-058#93:1:A>
Now you may ask why do we need to do this

<ICE-SIN:S2A-058#94:1:A>
The reason is because when when the model is still being is being
in the factory it contains certain chemicals

<ICE-SIN:S2A-058#95:1:A>
Which is on the surface of the of the figurines

<ICE-SIN:S2A-058#96:1:A>
Now if you if you paint this figure without removing all these
chemicals you will notice that about a few months down the road the figures
will start to erode the paint will start to fall off and of course nobody
would want that

<ICE-SIN:S2A-058#97:1:A>
So the very first thing you need to do is to wash them thoroughly
and then thorough and then dry them thoroughly with a dry cloth

<ICE-SIN:S2A-058#98:1:A>
You may need to use the hot air blower to dry them up if you need

<ICE-SIN:S2A-058#99:1:A>
Okay once the pieces are been cut and washed and dried now we
connect them together

<ICE-SIN:S2A-058#100:1:A>
For this process you will need the super glue

<ICE-SIN:S2A-058#101:1:A>
Let me show you by connecting this hand to the body

<ICE-SIN:S2A-058#102:1:A>
Put the super glue at the right places

<ICE-SIN:S2A-058#103:1:A>
Now we attach the hand snugly together and hold it there for five
seconds

<ICE-SIN:S2A-058#104:1:A>
Good now it's all done but if you look at the hands and the body
between the two areas where they are connected you realised that hey there
are places that show that it is a model-kit because there are holes there are
certain crevices that are not been filled up nicely

<ICE-SIN:S2A-058#105:1:A>
This is unavoidable

<ICE-SIN:S2A-058#106:1:A>
Now to remove these holes and crevices what we do now is to use
the putty

<ICE-SIN:S2A-058#107:1:A>
Let me show you

<ICE-SIN:S2A-058#108:1:A>
This putty looks like a plasticine and it can be molded

<ICE-SIN:S2A-058#109:1:A>
We take a sharp object like a toothpick now take an amount of
putty that is needed

<ICE-SIN:S2A-058#110:1:A>
Put it into the hole like this

<ICE-SIN:S2A-058#111:1:A>
Try to squash the putty around the edges until it's very nice

<ICE-SIN:S2A-058#112:1:A>
Good now we use a cotton bud

<ICE-SIN:S2A-058#113:1:A>
Dip it into water and now I put the cotton bud against the area
that need to be smoothen out because you notice the putty spreads out
everywhere and it's not smooth

<ICE-SIN:S2A-058#114:1:A>
Now you keep putting the cotton bud around the area and smooth out
all the whole area

<ICE-SIN:S2A-058#115:1:A>
Let it dry for a few minutes and now if you take a look at it you
don't see the crevices anymore and it looks as if the model actually came
with the hand and the body connected

<ICE-SIN:S2A-058#116:1:A>
Isn't it good

<ICE-SIN:S2A-058#117:1:A>
Now I'm not going to show you how to do the rest but I have now an
assembled Dr Death which I assembled earlier

<ICE-SIN:S2A-058#118:1:A>
This model now if you look at it has been fully assembled fully
puttied everything is smooth

<ICE-SIN:S2A-058#119:1:A>
Right now you think starts the painting process

<ICE-SIN:S2A-058#120:1:A>
Not yet

<ICE-SIN:S2A-058#121:1:A>
The very first thing we need to do now is to first of all
spray-paint the whole model-kit with a first coat

<ICE-SIN:S2A-058#122:1:A>
Now very important this first coat must be of a neutral colour so
I suggest you either use white or grey because these colours are not dark
enough to be evident at the end of the painting process

<ICE-SIN:S2A-058#123:1:A>
So let me spray-paint it using the grey colour

<ICE-SIN:S2A-058#124:1:A>
This spray-paint you can get it anywhere in any shops uhm
department stores for about nine or eight dollars per can but use sparingly

<ICE-SIN:S2A-058#125:1:A>
Let me demonstrate how do I actually spray-paint this figure

<ICE-SIN:S2A-058#126:1:A>
You will notice that I do not put the nozzle very very close to
the figure to be painted

<ICE-SIN:S2A-058#127:1:A>
I usually put about one and a half feet away from the figure and I
spray-paint it very evenly and very thinly across the whole figure

<ICE-SIN:S2A-058#128:1:A>
By putting it very closely you're your spray-paint will be too
thick on the figure and what this would do is that it would remove all the
intricacies and all the nooks and crevices on the figures <X>

<ICE-SIN:S2A-058#X129:1:A>
And all the surface parts will be all gone will be all covered by
this thick paint

<ICE-SIN:S2A-058#X130:1:A>
And we do not want that because we still want all these surfaces
to be there after the first coat

<ICE-SIN:S2A-058#X131:1:A>
It's very important and this is how you do it

<ICE-SIN:S2A-058#X132:1:A>
So just a very thin layer would do </X> </I>
