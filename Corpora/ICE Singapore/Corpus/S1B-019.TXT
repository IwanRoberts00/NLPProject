<I>

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-019#1:1:A>
Okay I'll have a deal with you

<ICE-SIN:S1B-019#2:1:A>
If you keep quiet and I get through this part okay you're going to
view a tape and you can get your own back on me get back on me because I used
to nit nit-pick on everything right that you do

<ICE-SIN:S1B-019#3:1:A>
So I can I'll show you one of the uhm stories I did for Life and
Times and then you can criticize

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-019#4:1:B>
Okay

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-019#5:1:A>
So if you guys don't pay attention fine I'll just drag this
session on

<ICE-SIN:S1B-019#6:1:A>
You all want to take your revenge

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-019#7:1:B>
Yes

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-019#8:1:A>
Okay what is a documentary

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-019#9:1:B>
Sh

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-019#10:1:A>
What is a documentary

<ICE-SIN:S1B-019#11:1:A>
It's a uhm you can see fantastic

<ICE-SIN:S1B-019#12:1:A>
You've got x-ray eyes or something

<ICE-SIN:S1B-019#13:1:A>
Okay what is this closest to a documentary

<ICE-SIN:S1B-019#14:1:A>
It's closest to a news story and like a news story it is factual

<ICE-SIN:S1B-019#15:1:A>
It is based on real events

<ICE-SIN:S1B-019#16:1:A>
Copy fast fast uh

<ICE-SIN:S1B-019#17:1:A>
Okay well just because you're not examined on it you don't want to
copy

<ICE-SIN:S1B-019#18:1:A>
That's fine with me too you know

<ICE-SIN:S1B-019#19:1:A>
Then I can move faster

<ICE-SIN:S1B-019#20:1:A>
Alright what does it records and documents

<ICE-SIN:S1B-019#21:1:A>
In other words what can a documentary cover

<ICE-SIN:S1B-019#22:1:A>
It can cover an event a moment in history okay like the very first
election or the referendum whatever or a person's life the life of C K Tang a
documentary on C K Tang

<ICE-SIN:S1B-019#23:1:A>
Have you seen the guy

<ICE-SIN:S1B-019#24:1:A>
Why do you laugh

<ICE-SIN:S1B-019#25:1:A>
A way of life okay

<ICE-SIN:S1B-019#26:1:A>
You might want uh want to document the the changes Kerwin go
through <unclear> word </unclear> metamorphosis of Kerwin Heng Social
behaviour okay

<ICE-SIN:S1B-019#27:1:A>
What sort of social behaviour can you think of for that documentary

<ICE-SIN:S1B-019#28:1:A>
Oh dating courtship love

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-019#29:1:B>
Oh please please uh

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-019#30:1:A>
Okay things like that you know

<ICE-SIN:S1B-019#31:1:A>
A documentary on mental illness etceteras

<ICE-SIN:S1B-019#32:1:A>
So a documentary can be on whole variety of topics but it actually
goes beyond the who what when and how

<ICE-SIN:S1B-019#33:1:A>
What is it that makes the documentary different

<ICE-SIN:S1B-019#34:1:A>
A documentary explains the why questions

<ICE-SIN:S1B-019#35:1:A>
You guys do news writing who what when how you hardly can cover the
why in a news story and all the more not so for a TV story

<ICE-SIN:S1B-019#36:1:A>
A TV news story there's no time to explain the why unless you take
more than two minutes

<ICE-SIN:S1B-019#37:1:A>
So in a documentary it actually explains the why

<ICE-SIN:S1B-019#38:1:A>
Now if there are so many similarities how is it different from a
news feature

<ICE-SIN:S1B-019#39:1:A>
More in-depth and how would it affect the look of the documentary
then

<ICE-SIN:S1B-019#40:1:A>
If you have to cover something more in-depth what happens

<ICE-SIN:S1B-019#41:1:A>
You need more time okay

<ICE-SIN:S1B-019#42:1:A>
First of all you notice that a documentary is much longer ah must
it always be slow-paced

<ICE-SIN:S1B-019#43:1:A>
What sort of documentaries have a slow pace

<ICE-SIN:S1B-019#44:1:A>
What have you seen

<ICE-SIN:S1B-019#45:1:A>
Nature

<ICE-SIN:S1B-019#46:1:A>
Ya

<ICE-SIN:S1B-019#47:1:A>
Those are mostly slow-paced or some sometimes documentaries on
behaviour mental illness

<ICE-SIN:S1B-019#48:1:A>
You actually need to show the person's uhm actions and and
behaviour right in its actual context rather than just hitting all over

<ICE-SIN:S1B-019#49:1:A>
So the length uh and the pace depends on the story itself

<ICE-SIN:S1B-019#50:1:A>
The angles and the areas covered of course as you pointed out more
in-depth so you cover from various areas various angles looking at the topic
from different angles and pace and rhythm

<ICE-SIN:S1B-019#51:1:A>
Now some documents may be slow-paced right through

<ICE-SIN:S1B-019#52:1:A>
slow-fast-and-slow because you have to sustain interest for half
and hour for an hour

<ICE-SIN:S1B-019#53:1:A>
It depends

<ICE-SIN:S1B-019#54:1:A>
Now I can't even keep at my own

<ICE-SIN:S1B-019#55:1:A>
Okay actually follows through

<ICE-SIN:S1B-019#56:1:A>
It's a follow-through of an event or a period of development

<ICE-SIN:S1B-019#57:1:A>
Okay either you document it as it happens that's what most
documentaries all are uh are are about they document things as it happens

<ICE-SIN:S1B-019#58:1:A>
But sometimes things uh have already happened

<ICE-SIN:S1B-019#59:1:A>
What do you do

<ICE-SIN:S1B-019#60:1:A>
What can you do

<ICE-SIN:S1B-019#61:1:A>
If something has already happened and you want to document it still
you re-enact right by possible dramatization or re-enactment

<ICE-SIN:S1B-019#62:1:A>
How many of you have seen uhm My name is Bertha

<ICE-SIN:S1B-019#63:1:A>
My name is Nadra not Bertha okay

<ICE-SIN:S1B-019#64:1:A>
That is uh what do you call that kind of documentaries

<ICE-SIN:S1B-019#65:1:A>
Docu-drama or dramatized documentary ya

<ICE-SIN:S1B-019#66:1:A>
Now dramatized documentary a dramatized documentary has some
problems

<ICE-SIN:S1B-019#67:1:A>
What is one of the main problems that a documentary uh producer of
a dramatized documentary would face

<ICE-SIN:S1B-019#68:1:A>
Accuracy

<ICE-SIN:S1B-019#69:1:A>
In what sense

<ICE-SIN:S1B-019#70:1:A>
Well basically because when you are dramatizing something you take
some dramatic licence right and that can border upon some fictionalization
you over-dramatize it so that it it's more compact and more interesting for
uhm television

<ICE-SIN:S1B-019#71:1:A>
So in other words what happens is that if you over-dramatize it or
you may add on little details which is so-called not true okay

<ICE-SIN:S1B-019#72:1:A>
And when that happens the persons involved or even the institutions
involved can sue you

<ICE-SIN:S1B-019#73:1:A>
You know they took a long while over this documentary My name is
Nadra not Bertha

<ICE-SIN:S1B-019#74:1:A>
It's started well the producer started doing it before I left SBC
and was just telecast this year and that's because of sourcing for the p
people alright getting the person to well getting the various persons to talk
about what happened so that when they get the actors and actresses together
they can actually portray the people involved in that charac in that in that
uhm uhm mannerisms or whatever you see

<ICE-SIN:S1B-019#75:1:A>
So if the person is very energetic he'll por portray that image

<ICE-SIN:S1B-019#76:1:A>
Someone who is very soft and gentle you have to portray that image
too okay

<ICE-SIN:S1B-019#77:1:A>
Okay what's involved in a preparation and production of a
documentary

<ICE-SIN:S1B-019#78:1:A>
What's involved

<ICE-SIN:S1B-019#79:1:A>
In the very first very first thing you have to do

<ICE-SIN:S1B-019#80:1:A>
Say for a new story research Okay research you have to find out as
much as possible at this stage

<ICE-SIN:S1B-019#81:1:A>
We should never purposely exclude information What happens when you
do decide to say highlight a certain angle of a document <unclear> word
</unclear> an an issue and you exclude all other issues you may distort okay
you may distort the story

<ICE-SIN:S1B-019#82:1:A>
You have a you need a full understanding of a topic before you
actually zero in on the angle you want

<ICE-SIN:S1B-019#83:1:A>
So there's content or subject research you read up you find out
about the subject

<ICE-SIN:S1B-019#84:1:A>
Materials research

<ICE-SIN:S1B-019#85:1:A>
Now this is slightly different from the content research

<ICE-SIN:S1B-019#86:1:A>
Okay later on I'll show you this story on uhm at the movies

<ICE-SIN:S1B-019#87:1:A>
It's about uhm it's tracing the various uh tracks of movies that
have passed through the ages through Singapore cinema etceteras

<ICE-SIN:S1B-019#88:1:A>
So okay I want to do something on cinema the very first cinema I
know it's uh it's along Beach Road

<ICE-SIN:S1B-019#89:1:A>
But where do I find it

<ICE-SIN:S1B-019#90:1:A>
I mean so I've to research and check out what sort of materials do
I get

<ICE-SIN:S1B-019#91:1:A>
Black and white photos from archives or <unclear> word </unclear>
footage film footage okay <unclear> word </unclear> have to look for
materials

<ICE-SIN:S1B-019#92:1:A>
And you have to check whether what you read about whether it can be
portrayed or visualized

<ICE-SIN:S1B-019#93:1:A>
Then of course there's a location surveys

<ICE-SIN:S1B-019#94:1:A>
The location survey is really for you to go to that place it's like
being there

<ICE-SIN:S1B-019#95:1:A>
But sometimes you can't go on a location surveys right

<ICE-SIN:S1B-019#96:1:A>
Sometimes you just have to go and see for yourself like the last
time when you did hong hong bao special

<ICE-SIN:S1B-019#97:1:A>
Even you have to survey the location you can't figure out what
happens and so you have to play by ear

<ICE-SIN:S1B-019#98:1:A>
Now there're times of course you can actually use your common sense
even though you don't survey that place you can find out look for let's say
I'm supposed to film an missile covet the lady's uh gunboat and nuh okay I
went for the resear uh res uh recce but I can't bring the whole crew along so
what can I do

<ICE-SIN:S1B-019#99:1:A>
I'll ask the navy for magazines alright and in the magazines
they'll of course they will have pictures of their their gunboats etceteras
and I'll show it to my camera crew

<ICE-SIN:S1B-019#100:1:A>
So in a way you're surveying and researching for them too

<ICE-SIN:S1B-019#101:1:A>
So think of all the means you have whatever is within your means
to uhm get well get yourself well-prepared and yours your uh production team
to be well-prepared too

<ICE-SIN:S1B-019#102:1:A>
Now besides that you also have research interviews interview
people concerned talk to them before you actually record the interview for a
video and at the end of course you've to collate your research okay

<ICE-SIN:S1B-019#103:1:A>
Now in collating your research you're actually preparing a sort of
a script For those of you who whom I taught for one session for radio last
semester

<ICE-SIN:S1B-019#104:1:A>
Remember I did something on uhm SBC uh English drama so the
various areas you know that we can discuss uh if you were to deal with it as
a story what are the ang various angles you can take

<ICE-SIN:S1B-019#105:1:A>
Right you can talk about Singlish

<ICE-SIN:S1B-019#106:1:A>
You can talk about local playwrights

<ICE-SIN:S1B-019#107:1:A>
You can talk about uhm stories with a local context okay

<ICE-SIN:S1B-019#108:1:A>
So you have to collate your research and when you prepare your
script bear in mind many stages many drafts and each draft will get better
and closer it should really get closer to what its story should look like in
the end

<ICE-SIN:S1B-019#109:1:A>
First stage treatment what else

<ICE-SIN:S1B-019#110:1:A>
You should all know what a treatment should contain right

<ICE-SIN:S1B-019#111:1:A>
Those who don't do not go out and say uh Miss Lee taught us
because I didn't not teach you did not not teach you what a treatment is

<ICE-SIN:S1B-019#112:1:A>
A treatment is supposed to sell your story

<ICE-SIN:S1B-019#113:1:A>
Now your editor may say okay go ahead with the treatment just for
audience

<ICE-SIN:S1B-019#114:1:A>
Sometimes you may be doing a documentary for overseas consumption
your audience is different so you have to bear that in mind too

<ICE-SIN:S1B-019#115:1:A>
Now in a documentary it's quite different from a news story okay

<ICE-SIN:S1B-019#116:1:A>
You may be able to figure out okay in this story in this news
story this is the kind of angle this is what's new that's why I'm going for
this press conference or that's why I'm attending this event

<ICE-SIN:S1B-019#117:1:A>
In a documentary things are you may probably have to count from
the people you interview something that's new something that's not being
talked about or little known but you're not going to give put the headline
right up at the top right

<ICE-SIN:S1B-019#118:1:A>
You probably have an outline an outline strip covering the various
areas okay

<ICE-SIN:S1B-019#119:1:A>
So you'll be uhm what you call an outline script or a shooting
script

<ICE-SIN:S1B-019#120:1:A>
Now you can't predict everything that can happen during a
documentary because things unfold as you go along especially when you're
covering uhm things that's uh of a present moment alright you do a
documentary on a present event

<ICE-SIN:S1B-019#121:1:A>
So you have an outline uh script to guide you okay based on the
research these are things that might happen and these are things you can
shoot and you work along you you would uhm revise your script as you go along

<ICE-SIN:S1B-019#122:1:A>
It's really what you call scripting the unpredictable

<ICE-SIN:S1B-019#123:1:A>
Now when you say you're scripting the unpredictable it is say you
don't really not have a script you have a partially scripted uhm script with
you to say okay uhm what can we talk about

<ICE-SIN:S1B-019#124:1:A>
Say when I went to Holland to do a story on frozen pork ugh frozen
pigs sorry for students Muslims

<ICE-SIN:S1B-019#125:1:A>
But you know I had to I have to go to Holland to do a uh little
story for Friday Background

<ICE-SIN:S1B-019#126:1:A>
It was in line with this eat frozen pork <unclear> word </unclear>
because they were phasing out the the pig farms in Ponggol

<ICE-SIN:S1B-019#127:1:A>
So I really didn't know what to expect because I've never been to
a factory before

<ICE-SIN:S1B-019#128:1:A>
They will slaughter the pigs and freeze it freeze the pigs within
two and a half hours alright the hygiene conditions etceteras

<ICE-SIN:S1B-019#129:1:A>
So what I wrote into the script for all the camera crew would be
uhm as we go along alright

<ICE-SIN:S1B-019#130:1:A>
These are various steps and I'll write down you know uhm they told
me there's slaughter there's the burning you know uh singeing the pigs so
that the bristles will fall off etceteras <X>

<ICE-SIN:S1B-019#X131:1:A>
Ya So I'll write down the different steps but when you are there
it's really playing by ear I don't know what to expect but even so you have
to decide okay what are the cut-aways As we go along of course there's this
chap who was with us from the factory and someone from the Meat Association
and he'll tell us this is important Ya there is a Meat Association because
Holland you know exporting lots of meat Not in <unclear> word </unclear> not
like in Singapore We only have what tourist association hotel association and
then what else So he would tell us he would tell us what is important Now My
goodness Tsk hai now in Holland in The Netherlands you know Of course we stay
in Amsterdam and every morning we've to have to drive two and a half hours up
into the the outskirts the pig farms Okay now the point I want to make is thi

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-019#X132:1:B>
when you're filming when you're filming and there's someone
who's with you who knows more about the place you need to talk to that person
as you're filming and say this is important ask him why is it important and
that's your other research It's while you're doing the the filming you're
actually researching in detail Now the other thing is of course this is this
is an instance where I couldn't I wasn't sent ahead of the crew to do my
racking my research etcetra so I have to do it then and there when we are
shooting But what happens when you are in Singapore Is there a reason to do
it on as you are going along researching as you uhm film Sometimes yes let's
say when you want to do a story on nature you know the birds are supposed to
be in a forest On the day you racky the birds are all there in fact I counted
ten types ten species within an hour I was so ex excited The day I went
without Christopher Hales the guy who the ornithtologist the the day I went
with my crew and without him there was no bird to be sighted for One whole
morning It's not it's really no joke because uhm they just don't come out on
the day I don't know Maybe the guys were smoking so the <unclear> word
</unclear> birds can read some smoke signals and I was panicking my will Woon
Tye Ho understand you know that we were there but there were no birds
especially since I sold him the story by telling him that at least ten
species you know Within half an hour can see ten species Okay sold do the
story First day of shoot no birds second of sh shoot no birds so what happens
So you have to script the unpredictable Whatever you have write in A
breakdown script okay </X> </I>
