<I>

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#1:1:A>
I'm shifting to the marketing department

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#2:1:B>
Uh uhm uh what's the date that you're going

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#3:1:A>
Uh Lin Chin has said that um it's with effect from August

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#4:1:B>
That's nice

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#5:1:A>
Uh actually what's the proper procedure the

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#6:1:B>
Uh

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#7:1:A>
Supposed we have <unclear> word </unclear>

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#8:1:B>
I have to speak to Kok Wah because probably he already gave the
clearance from what I right

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#9:1:A>
Ya but then uh admin has to

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#10:1:B>
Ya we have to issue a note to say you are henceforth posted to
the new section

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#11:1:A>
Okay

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#12:1:B>
So since <unclear> word </unclear> cleared I don't expect too
much problems

<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#13:1:B>
But uh who's replacing you

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#14:1:A>
Uh I think that uh admin's supposed to have

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#15:1:B>
Recruit is it

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#16:1:A>
Ya

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#17:1:B>
That's why we have to look at this recruitment in about new
AOs

<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#18:1:B>
We've got quite a few applicants but we don't know whether we want
to you know advertise another round again ya

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#19:1:A>
Do we have vacancies

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#20:1:B>
Ya your vacancy because we've shifted you <unclear> word
</unclear>

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#21:1:A>
All right

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#22:1:B>
And uh some other vacancy you know

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#23:1:A>
Okay

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#24:1:B>
Around so uh when Edie comes back lah

<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#25:1:B>
He's away until twenty twentieth

<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#26:1:B>
So when he comes back we'd probably get his clearance to do
something

<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#27:1:B>
Probably do another round because at the moment we're doing the
clerks and the lower paid staff

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#28:1:A>
Uhm

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#29:1:B>
So after that uh after we finish that round of interviews then
we'll come back to the <unclear> word </unclear> business again

<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#30:1:B>
There're quite a few applicants but I think maybe my <unclear> word
</unclear> it it depends on him

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#31:1:A>
Oh

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#32:1:B>
When when when to do it you see

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#33:1:A>
Okay

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#34:1:B>
So uh so what have you been doing there

<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#35:1:B>
Have you started work there

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#36:1:A>
Ya uhm I'm helping out with the <unclear> word </unclear>
dinner which is August the third

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#37:1:B>
Ah third ya

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#38:1:A>
And then uh I think Suzanne is giving me uh it's indicated
that

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#39:1:B>
Uh uhm

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#40:1:A>
Uh I should do certain projects lah

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#41:1:B>
Right

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#42:1:A>
Uh like just now I was uh creating a file for uh this this
violinist from England

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#43:1:B>

<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#45:1:A>
He's going on tour in September ninety three

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#46:1:B>
And you're going to get sponsors for that group whatever

<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#48:1:B>

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#49:1:A>
Quite a number of staff uh in BM BMW in October

<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#50:1:A>
They're going to bring in either a opera or singing

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#51:1:B>

Uh BMW is sponsoring is it

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#55:1:A>
Ya

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#56:1:B>
Joined with NAC

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#57:1:A>
Ya

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#58:1:B>
Ah that's great

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#59:1:A>
We are presenting

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#60:1:B>
Uhm

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#61:1:A>
So

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#62:1:B>
What what's the opera

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#63:1:A>
I don't really know if it's an opera actually but

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#64:1:B>
Or is a musical

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#65:1:A>
Ya something like that

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#66:1:B>
It's on the music side is it

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#67:1:A>
Ya

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#68:1:B>
Ya that's fine

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#69:1:A>
And then

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#70:1:B>
So is it Kallang

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#71:1:A>
<unclear> word </unclear> I think that's the biggest venue lah

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#72:1:B>
Uhm

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#73:1:A>
Ya

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#74:1:B>
Well I'm sure we're all looking forward to going

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#75:1:A>
Ya

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#76:1:B>
So how

<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#77:1:B>
After Festival of Arts not dead yet

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#78:1:A>
No lah immigration almost killed me okay

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#79:1:B>
Ya but I think that's sorted out quite well and the Indian
group did come

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#80:1:A>
Ya

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#81:1:B>
That one that uh I helped you to clear

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#82:1:A>
Ya but uh I think in the I think the post-mortem helps in the
sense that uh it prepares the next person

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#83:1:B>
Next person

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#84:1:A>
Who is

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#85:1:B>
Ya

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#86:1:A>
Going to take over you see

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#87:1:B>
But we're probably trying to catch the same person 'cos then
the person

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#88:1:A>
No

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#89:1:B>
Will know the job better

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#90:1:A>
Oh no

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#91:1:B>
Well if you don't want uh you probably have to do logistics of
other sorts anyway or worse

<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#92:1:B>
Wait till they present you with ticketing where you have to be like
Connie and get scolding from the public

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#93:1:A>
Oh no

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#94:1:B>
Oh that's worse you know

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#95:1:A>
I'm not looking forward to it man

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#96:1:B>
Ya but that's uh that's one in two years right

<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#97:1:B>
But uh

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#98:1:A>
I think I had sleepless nights man about this

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#99:1:B>
Ya I know <unclear> word </unclear> sleepless nights about
something or other

<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#100:1:B>
So that's why they are going to give you all a thank you lunch or
dinner

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#101:1:A>
Not me

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#102:1:B>
All of us

<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#103:1:B>
All of us

<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#104:1:B>
All of us

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#105:1:A>
Really

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#106:1:B>
Every single one

<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#107:1:B>
Either Chairman or Minister will give something I mean a thank you
<unclear> word </unclear>

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#108:1:A>
Oh this year

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#109:1:B>
And uh council did say I think it's recorded in my notes

<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#110:1:B>
Oh hi we're like having a taped conversation

<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#111:1:B>
She's doing some survey work

<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#112:1:B>
Could you come in oh okay fine

<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#113:1:B>
Right

<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#114:1:B>
Okay

<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#115:1:B>
Fine okay right

<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#116:1:B>
Uh this one has to do with some endowment policy

<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#117:1:B>
We've been doing some research work there

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#118:1:A>
Oh ya

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#119:1:B>
Uhm so how to invest our money <unclear> word </unclear>

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#120:1:A>
Ya I think uh quite good lah now that after a year it's been
a year

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#121:1:B>
Uhm

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#122:1:A>
And I'm paying income tax

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#123:1:B>
Oh

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#124:1:A>
I just brought in my income tax form today

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#125:1:B>
And uh have you all got any new sponsors in mind

<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#126:1:B>
Don't name them in the tape though

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#127:1:A>
Oh ya uh

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#128:1:B>
Ya

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#129:1:A>
Is this going to be confidential

<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#130:1:A>
I hope so

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#131:1:B>
Uhm but we haven't discussed any <unclear> word </unclear>

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#132:1:A>
My career moves

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#133:1:B>
No but I mean it's like it's already known right

<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#134:1:B>
Because uh Kok Wah

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#135:1:A>
Ya

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#136:1:B>
Has agreed to it and uh you know shouldn't worry about it

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#137:1:A>
Ya

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#138:1:B>
It's just that I think it's a very exciting area to go into
but

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#139:1:A>
I think so

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#140:1:B>
You should also maybe get Suzanne's help or yourself because
we don't have the time really

<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#141:1:B>
If there are any marketing courses uh or fund-raising

<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#142:1:B>
Fund-raising usually they don't have fund-raising

<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#143:1:B>
We usually have to internally organize

<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#144:1:B>
But uh I suppose Suzanne can uh give you some advice

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#145:1:A>
Ya

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#146:1:B>
'Cos some of the courses that I'm <unclear> word </unclear>

<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#147:1:B>
I'm seeing someone on the sixteenth

<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#148:1:B>
This fellow is from don't-know-what university

<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#149:1:B>
Uh uh this was before I think what Lester or what Lest what don't
know which university in UK

<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#150:1:B>
Now they they've converted into a university

<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#151:1:B>
No that was a polytechnic before

<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#152:1:B>
Now it's converted to a university

<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#153:1:B>
Let me see where he's from Grayham Chapman Hai

<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#154:1:B>
I forgot which university <unclear> word </unclear> gave me the
card

<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#155:1:B>
He he's coming here and I was seeing whether we can link up
because there're like only two universities that do Arts Admin courses you
know

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#156:1:A>
Uhm

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#157:1:B>
This one and of course City University London

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#158:1:A>
Ya

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#159:1:B>
But I I think the States

<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#160:1:B>
Practically every other university has Arts Admin course

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#161:1:A>
Really

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#162:1:B>
Ya they've got a whole manual

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#163:1:A>
Oh I'm I'm so glad that

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#164:1:B>
Uhm

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#165:1:A>
You are <unclear> word </unclear>

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#166:1:B>
No I've had the <unclear> word </unclear> ya but the thing is
that we are debating as to whether you really need to uh

<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#167:1:B>
If you are already a graduate it's not necessary to do a like
three-year Arts Admin course because the Arts Admin course covers a lot of
areas which you already know

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#168:1:A>
That's true

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#169:1:B>
Uh marketing if you're Econs graduate Statistics and all that

<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#170:1:B>
You probably want to do like Diploma kind you know

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#171:1:A>
Uhm

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#172:1:B>
Or selected credit subjects

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#173:1:A>
Uhm

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#174:1:B>
Uhm

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#175:1:A>
But what if we uh are interested in say uh a marketing course
uh in in Institute of Singapore

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#176:1:B>
If ya uh you see we are quite liberal uh who is this person

<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#177:1:B>
Uh Yong Kian is already enrolled for a PR course you know and we
paid for it

<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#178:1:B>
If you do come across a marketing course which I think SIM and all
that has

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#179:1:A>
Yes yes ya

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#180:1:B>
Get a brochure

<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#181:1:B>
Let us know apply to us we definitely consider because we also get
SDF funding 'cos that mean we don't need to pay in total

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#182:1:A>
I see

<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#183:1:A>
Oh this is <unclear> word </unclear>

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#184:1:B>
So even for Yong Kian's one we're getting some SDF funding
okay

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#185:1:A>
Okay but I hear her she's it's a very uh short-term

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#186:1:B>
No

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#187:1:A>
Course right

<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#188:1:A>
It's like uh only about about few months

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#189:1:B>
But she sits for

<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#190:1:B>
Ya ya a few months and then she gets a cert

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#191:1:A>
Uhm

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#192:1:B>
But you see I think uh yours could be a longer one

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#193:1:A>
Ya

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#194:1:B>
It could be a diploma

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#195:1:A>
Ya

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#196:1:B>
So we I do not know the detailed arrangements but if say you
it's relevant to your area of work

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#197:1:A>
Uhm

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#198:1:B>
We will support if it's not too expensive and you can get SDF
funding <unclear> word </unclear>

<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#199:1:B>
We got to look at that aspect

<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#200:1:B>
And then also uh I don't know whether they'll bond people

<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#201:1:B>
I mean if we pay and

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#202:1:A>
Oh

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#203:1:B>
Whether we'll bond them but

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#204:1:A>
Oh I see

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#205:1:B>
I mean if if it's only two three thousand I don't think we'll
bond them

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#206:1:A>
Okay

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#207:1:B>
Uh

<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#208:1:B>
But then like Yong Kian was saying that she wanted us to pay her
membership fee after she's completed the course

<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#209:1:B>
But I think that's not fair lah because after you complete a
course it's already your own personal one whether you want to continue

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#210:1:A>
Membership fee

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#211:1:B>
Ya I think what this Institute of what Public Public Relation

<$A>

Ya ya

<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#214:1:B>
It's so ya

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#215:1:A>
thing <unclear> word </unclear> altogether uh

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#216:1:B>
So you should look at those SIM courses because I think you
can even take exams that are you know marked by accredited uh institutions
abroad

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#217:1:A>
Uh uhm

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#218:1:B>
So you do come out with another skill

<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#219:1:B>
A danger of training you people so well you become so marketable
you say goodbye to us at the end of it

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#220:1:A>
Oh ya

<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#221:1:A>
But then no risk no gain

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#222:1:B>
Uhm well we expect well you you have some commitment uh

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#223:1:A>
Uh

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#224:1:B>
But you'll probably say you want some career path mapped out
for you too

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#225:1:A>
Ya

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#226:1:B>
Uh uh

<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#227:1:B>
So you I mean we will well in a way if we were to to train you and
all it's already part of career development and all that

<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#228:1:B>
And it also would depend on your performance and what they they

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#229:1:A>
Uhm

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#230:1:B>
Consider I mean we have to look at your CEP lah

<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#231:1:B>
CEP is always moving

<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#232:1:B>
You know what is CEP or not

<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#233:1:B>
Current Estimated Potential

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#234:1:A>
Rising hopefully

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#235:1:B>

government's eyes all scholars have very high CEP future Perm Secs

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#238:1:A>

<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#239:1:B>
That kind of thing

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#240:1:A>
But uh I think that any investment will will entail some form
of risk lah

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#241:1:B>
Ya

<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#242:1:A>

goodbye

job you know

<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#263:1:B>
That that's the

<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#264:1:B>
Then from there then they'll determine the market value of the job

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-042#265:1:A>
