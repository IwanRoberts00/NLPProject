<h> <bold> Will the real grad stand up </bold> </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-002#2:1>
<p> By The end of today, a total of 5,729 people would have received their
degrees in this year' National University of Singapore convocation
exercise.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-002#3:1>
Among them are the upwardly-mobile who, legend has it, are
transforming the socio-political landscape with their high material
expectations, their social self-confidence and their anti-establishment
views.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-002#4:1>
This is one image of Singapore's educated youth.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-002#5:1>
Another is equally pervasive.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-002#6:1>
Our graduates are seen as listeners, hardworking and sensible
but lacking in imagination and spirit. </p>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-002#7:1>
<p> Both stereotypes, of what one survey firm called the <quote> Brat Pack
</quote> and the <quote> Frogs in the Well </quote> , have some truth to
them.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-002#8:1>
lt is pointless to ask which group the real graduate falls into,
as if a university produces only one type of person.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-002#9:1>
It is equally futile, and quite wrong, for their elders or their peers
to demand that graduates squash themselves into a mould.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-002#10:1>
But it is right to ask how each of these diverse individuals will
contribute to their society.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-002#11:1>
The graduate population is growing, but will remain a minority.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-002#12:1>
Having received the best education society could give them, graduates
should be conscious of their privilege and their responsibility. </p>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-002#13:1>
<p> Therefore, it would be a shame if the quiet, hardworking types were
oblivious to the needs of their neighbours; if what they called pragmatic
self-interest was really selfishness and greed.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-002#14:1>
Equally sad, if the more progressive ones were vocal only on matters
affecting themselves; if their openness was limited to finding new ways of
self-gratification.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-002#15:1>
Society calls on them to volunteer their leadership and expertise, at
the workplace, in social service, or in the fray of politics.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-002#16:1>
The call is an old one.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-002#17:1>
Will today's real graduate stand up and be counted? </p> </I>

<h> <bold> No right of way for road bullies </bold> </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-002#19:2>
<p> ROAD hooligans are adding a new dimension of danger on to Singapore
roads.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-002#20:2>
It seems that it is no longer enough to follow the highway code; now
one has to abide by mysterious rules set and enforced at whim by the bullies.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-002#21:2>
Nor is it enough to survive a collision between vehicles; one now has
to cope with any human confrontation that may follow.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-002#22:2>
Accidents, near-accidents and nonincidents are increasingly
turning nasty.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-002#23:2>
The bullies imagine their rights as road-users, even their very
manhood, threatened.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-002#24:2>
Brakes screech.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-002#25:2>
Abuses are hurled, punches, even helmets, thrown or weapons swung.
</p>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-002#26:2>
<p> What in the world is going on here?

<ICE-SIN:W2E-002#27:2>
For one, there is too much bad driving: dangerous cutting in and out
of lanes, non-use of indicator lights, overtaking on the left, road hogging
and tail-gating.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-002#28:2>
These are obvious irritants that could annoy even the milder of
roadusers and the Traffic Police must be more vigilant in ensuring that the
rules of the road are obeyed by all.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-002#29:2>
But poor driving is one thing, thuggery another.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-002#30:2>
And the recent spate of cases of intimidation, verbal abuse and
outright violence suggests a need for deterrent action to warn other
would-be bullies that this kind of behaviour will not be tolerated. </p>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-002#31:2>
<p> To be sure, the courts have dealt sternly with the cases that have come
before them.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-002#32:2>
That, plus the publicity given to the cases, may perhaps be
sufficient to give pause to potential bullies.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-002#33:2>
But it usually takes two sides to make a quarrel and in some of the
cases, it would appear that the miscreants were provoked or even
threatened in the first place.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-002#34:2>
And while they fully deserve the punishment they get, it does
not seem right that the other side should get off scot-free.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-002#35:2>
Civility and order on the road, all the more important as traffic
grows, can only be obtained if everyone abides by the rules.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-002#36:2>
They would be more inclined to do that if they know that punishment
for violations will be evenly meted out.

<h> <bold> Green roots of Singapore </bold> </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-002#38:3>
<p> THE amount of waste generated in Singapore continues to offend the
small number of environmentally conscious people here.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-002#39:3>
Some have appealed for a comprehensive recycling scheme.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-002#40:3>
This is a worthy goal, but before it can take off, Singapore's
budding environmental activists need to convince others not only of its need,
but also of its practicability.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-002#41:3>
In particular, how would it fit into existing structures and
institutions?

<ICE-SIN:W2E-002#42:3>
The widely held view of environmentalism as an idealistic
preoccupation of a few makes it especially important that the eco-activists
find domestic roots for a green Singapore. </p>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-002#43:3>
<p> This may not be as difficult as it seems.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-002#44:3>
Singapore already has an indigenous environmental tradition to
build on, even if it was never called that.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-002#45:3>
The state has cleaned streets, planted trees, kept out polluting
factories, treated sewage and cleaned rivers.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-002#46:3>
The success of these schemes, which addressed the environmental
problems as perceived at the time, depended on a combination of
public works, legislation and public education.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-002#47:3>
And these are the very elements needed for any nation-wide recycling
programme.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-002#48:3>
The precedents are encouraging. </p>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-002#49:3>
<p> Nor can environmentalists afford to ignore the private sector.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-002#50:3>
After all, the people at the frontline of environmentalism in
Singapore are really the rag-andbone men who make the rounds of residential
areas in search of recyclable paper.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-002#51:3>
Identifying the conditions that make this a profitable business
in Singapore - it is not so in many other cities - could well point the way
forward for environmentalists.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-002#52:3>
In turning Singapore's attention to new environmental
challenges, they need to build on the environmental tradition that
already exists. </p> </I>

<h> <bold> What a world to inherit </bold> </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-002#54:4>
<p> CHILDREN are the new international underclass.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-002#55:4>
When they do not die at birth, poor children are forced into early
adulthood without the physical and mental protection age brings, to work in
the marketplace, to fight wars, to help run drug rings, to go into
prostitution.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-002#56:4>
Venerated as the conscience and the future of the world, children are
born into a world without a conscience and a future, as it must seem to the
many Oliver Twists of today.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-002#57:4>
They suffer from poverty and crime not only in the developing
countries; children in the developed world, too, are scarred by
homelessness, loneliness and alienation.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-002#58:4>
Children do not have the vote, so their interests are not crucial to
politicians; kids cannot organise themselves, so they do not threaten the
state into ameliorative action.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-002#59:4>
The language of this underclass is a silence more awesome than words
can tell. </p>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-002#60:4>
<p> The lot of the Singapore child is far better.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-002#61:4>
Recognised as the only resource this country has, he is well fed,
housed, educated and generally well looked after.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-002#62:4>
Strong family ties ensure that he lives not just in a house but in a
home.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-002#63:4>
While some parents err on the side of softness, as others do on the
side of the rod, the general ethos is balanced.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-002#64:4>
There are juvenile problems, but they do not subvert the basis
of social life.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-002#65:4>
These are mercies whose worth is magnified many times over when
Singaporeans look at the world. </p>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-002#66:4>
<p> Today, more than 70 leaders from countries across the globe will
meet at the United Nations in New York to discuss the plight of children.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-002#67:4>
They should do so without politics intervening in the search for
solutions.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-002#68:4>
National governments, as well as the private organisations
which sometimes are the only hope of these tragic children, have much to do
to restore to the child his childhood - so that he can be a better father of
the man. </p> </I>
<I>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-002#69:5>
<h> <bold> Leaden answer </bold> </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-002#70:5>
<p> PERHAPS it was just a slip of the tongue.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-002#71:5>
If not, then Environment Minister Ahmad Mattar did himself and the
Government injustice by the way he answered a question in Parliament last
week on unleaded petrol.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-002#72:5>
He had just announced that the Government would promote its use in
Singapore.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-002#73:5>
It is a step that everyone is likely to applaud because, as he
reminded the House, studies have shown that exposure to high concentrations
of lead can do nasty things to people, especially children.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-002#74:5>
But the problem is that unleaded petrol costs more to produce.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-002#75:5>
And experience in other countries, including environmentconscious
Germany, shows that drivers will not voluntarily convert to the
cleaner fuel if it costs them more.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-002#76:5>
How, then, can Singapore's motorists be encouraged to make the
switch? </p>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-002#77:5>
<p> The answer, in Dr Mattar's words, is to <quote> create a price
differential in favour of unleaded petrol </quote> .

<ICE-SIN:W2E-002#78:5>
In plain language, make unleaded cheaper than leaded.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-002#79:5>
The question is how?

<ICE-SIN:W2E-002#80:5>
The obvious and most equitable way, one would have thought, is to
reduce the duty on unleaded, at least till such time that Singaporeans have
grown accustomed to using it and will continue to do so as a matter of
course.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-002#81:5>
True, it might mean a loss of revenue for the taxman.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-002#82:5>
But the increase in oil price since the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait has
already given the Government an unexpected windfall which should go some way,
perhaps even fully, to compensate for the loss.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-002#83:5>
Unfortunately, the Government does not look at it this way.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-002#84:5>
So along with the lowering of duty for unleaded petrol, it also
intends levying an additional duty on the leaded variety. </p>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-002#85:5>
<p> That might not be very objectionable if all cars in Singapore can switch.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-002#86:5>
Then those wilfully refusing to yield to the lure of cheaper
unleaded deserve to be hit by the extra tax.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-002#87:5>
But as Dr Mattar pointed out, this is not the case: some 10 per cent
or 32,000 of the petroldriven cars on the road today are older than seven
years and <it> cannot </it> use unleaded petrol.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-002#88:5>
Their owners are thus being penalised unfairly in the drive for
cleaner air, a point two MPs made.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-002#89:5>
Theoretically, one could easily defend this.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-002#90:5>
It is hardly the first time that a section of the population, through
no fault of its own, has had to suffer unfairness for the greater good of the
country.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-002#91:5>
Land owners, for instance, have periodically had their property
acquired, for road widening or re-development.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-002#92:5>
And pig farmers, not too long ago, had to give up their way of
life to make for a cleaner Singapore.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-002#93:5>
It may be unfair, but Singaporeans realise and can accept that this
is the way life is sometimes. </p>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-002#94:5>

<p> Sadly, Dr Mattar apparently did not think the MPs' objections were of
sufficient gravity.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-002#95:5>
His answer was a specious non-answer.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-002#96:5>
The <quote> majority </quote> of the affected cars,
he said, <quote> belong to the category of BMWs, the Mercedes and so
on.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-002#97:5>
And so I think they should have no problem in paying </quote>
.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-002#98:5>
This reply cannot but beg a host of further questions.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-002#99:5>
For example, what has a person's ability to pay got to do with
the issue?

<ICE-SIN:W2E-002#100:5>
Is one to conclude that in this instance, the underlying thinking is
one of soaking the rich?

<ICE-SIN:W2E-002#101:5>
If so, is the criterion ownership of certain brands of cars,
regardless of model or age?

<ICE-SIN:W2E-002#102:5>
Will it apply to areas other than duty on petrol?

<ICE-SIN:W2E-002#103:5>
What does he mean by " majority"?

<ICE-SIN:W2E-002#104:5>
What about the rest, the cheaper makes of cars?

<ICE-SIN:W2E-002#105:5>
Do their owners get a rebate?

<ICE-SIN:W2E-002#106:5>
But instead of asking these and more, the MPs seemed to think that
Dr Mattar's reply was amusing and laughed heartily at it.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-002#107:5>
But it is no laughing matter, either to owners of those big cars or
to Singaporeans who expect more from their MPs, especially now that they have
been grouped into committees to help them tackle issues more
effectively and in greater depth.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-002#108:5>
The opportunity had presented itself for MPs to demonstrate to
Singaporeans that they could be counted on to raise pertinent issues
and press home their arguments on ministers - and not let the latter get away
with wishy-washy answers.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-002#109:5>
Sadly, they let it pass. </p> </I>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-002#110:6>
<h> <bold> Rules to heed all concerns </bold> </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-002#111:6>
<p> FOR many young parents in Singapore, the daunting task of getting
their child into a top-rated school begins at birth or before, the
competitiveness of primary school admission being what it is.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-002#112:6>
For the past decade, parents and school administrators have
coped bravely, though not silently, with a tortuously complicated set of
rules which puts children into six sub-categories under three phases of
registration for school entry.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-002#113:6>
The planned revision of these rules, the details of which areeagerly
awaited, is therefore timely and welcome. </p> <X>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-002#X114:6>
<p> Entry to school in Singapore has been used since the 1960s as a tool of
population planning.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-002#X115:6>
First, this was an effective means of controlling the size of the
population increase in the stop-at-two era.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-002#X116:6>
Later, it was used for selective population control to enhance the
quality of the increase by encouraging the better educated both to procreate
and, if they already had a child, to have more children.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-002#X117:6>
This was the aim of the graduate mother policy.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-002#X118:6>
The last revision to the rules in 1987 came when the population
policy turned to exhorting young, bettereducated couples to have three or
more children if they could afford them.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-002#X119:6>
Singaporeans have been mostly responsive to the incentives and
disincentives wielded by the school admission criteria.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-002#X120:6>
They had themselves sterilised, either temporarily or permanently,
and had no more than two children.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-002#X121:6>
Later, graduate women began to have more children than just two
though it is uncertain if this was sufficient to offset the numbers of third,
fourth or fifth children born of less-educated women.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-002#X122:6>
Remnants of the earlier policies, though no longer relevant, had to
remain until their effects had worked themselves out of the system.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-002#X123:6>
These have complicated the current rules. </p>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-002#X124:6>
<p> Both the Minister and the Minister of State for Education have indicated
that the revised criteria would give greater weight to education than to
family considerations.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-002#X125:6>
Three criteria have been singled out: having a sibling in the
school of choice, having parents connected to the school and living near the
school.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-002#X126:6>
It is difficult to fault these criteria in themselves since they
promise parents an easier time, with less travelling and shuttling between
schools, and encourage parents to be more involved in school activities.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-002#X127:6>
They do focus on educational considerations in a broad sense and
they serve the interests of parents more than the demands of state planning.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-002#X128:6>
But there can be unwelcome effects to policies based too
simplistically on such criteria.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-002#X129:6>
Education policy-makers and professionals must know well that such
policies, in a system where schools vary greatly in the quality of education
they provide, may reduce the spread of educational opportunity to less
equitable levels than before. </p>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-002#X130:6>
<p> True, no set of rules, no matter how well it balances competing
interests, can please all parents, or serve the more immediate individual
convenience and preferences of parents as well as the larger interests of the
state.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-002#X131:6>
The criterion of connection to the school, for instance, is likely
to work to the advantage of the wealthy and the socially privileged: Hence
the fear already expressed by parents who do not belong to this class.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-002#X132:6>
School admission is, understandably, an emotional issue for the
majority.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-002#X133:6>
And yet there are no easy formulas to resolve the problem.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-002#X134:6>
Balloting, but within quotas, may be one way, but competitive entry
examinations for five-year-olds are, emphatically, not.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-002#X135:6>
Policy-makers will have to resist simplifying the rules merely to
make them easier to administer or more convenient for parents.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-002#X136:6>
It is correct to disregard, or at least give less weight to, social
policy considerations such as family size and educational qualifications of
parents, but criteria for entry to primary school must spread the best
educational opportunity as fairly as it is possible to manage.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-002#X137:6>
This will satisfy many, if not most, parents and ensure that more
of the country's talent is nurtured than would be in a system where privilege
pulls too much weight. </p> </X> </I>
