With nine days to go before the votes are cast the political
parties are losing no time in stating their campaign platforms

<ICE-SIN:S1B-045#2:1:A>
Just this afternoon four political parties held press conferences

<ICE-SIN:S1B-045#3:1:A>
Mr Goh Chok Tong defined the issue for the PAP

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-045#4:1:B>
I call this election so I remain the issue in the
constituencies to be contested I am con campaigning on the basis that my
style of open consultative government is a right one

<ICE-SIN:S1B-045#5:1:B>
You know my program they are pub it's published in the Next Lap

<ICE-SIN:S1B-045#6:1:B>
My principal programs within the Next Lap are Edusave Medifund Open
University Assistance Program to help the bottom ten percent of those living
in HDB flats

<ICE-SIN:S1B-045#7:1:B>
Whether we are in government now or not that's the issue in which we
will be contesting

<ICE-SIN:S1B-045#8:1:B>
Now I take on questions from uh the floor

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-045#9:1:C>
You talk about seeking a clear mandate from the people what do
you exactly mean by that

<$B> Well it's a matter of public perception I've been following the papers
quite a few people thought that uh a clear mandate means I must do better
than the last election

<ICE-SIN:S1B-045#10:1:B>
Some raise some mention figures of sixty-five percent others sixty
percent so it's a question of how the public perceive this clear mandate to
be

<ICE-SIN:S1B-045#11:1:B>
For myself I'm looking for an improvement over the last el
election's performance

<$D> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-045#12:1:D>
How does the PAP have to return to power

<ICE-SIN:S1B-045#13:1:D>
Going by what the opposition has said this is how they see that
fighting the election as in effect a by-election uh

<ICE-SIN:S1B-045#14:1:D>
How would the PAP pass its response to that particular strategy

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-045#15:1:B>
Well whether it's a general election or a by-election how they
want to fight it we are fighting on the basis that I'm the issue so you can
call it a by-election the fact remains that I am I am still the issue

<ICE-SIN:S1B-045#16:1:B>
My judgement is being now put to the test I judge it's a good time
to call election I judge that my leadership style is right for Singapore at
this moment

<ICE-SIN:S1B-045#17:1:B>
I believe in the program which I've announced so that's the issue
and it's something which I'm campaigning amongst the electorate to support

<ICE-SIN:S1B-045#18:1:B>
Now I think we should use the word mandate quite carefully because
the PAP is now in government so we've got a mandate to govern

<ICE-SIN:S1B-045#19:1:B>
The right term to use is endorsement

<ICE-SIN:S1B-045#20:1:B>
Before the election I was looking for a mandate now I'm looking for
an endorsement

<$E> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-045#21:1:E>
We're looking for a clear signal one which the voters
themselves will look at and say yes unambiguously this has expressed our will

<$F> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-045#22:1:F>
When you say you already have a a mandate a majority now you
need you want an endorsement and uh you need something better than last
election's performance would that be more than sixty-one point uh percent of
the votes

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-045#23:1:B>
Well in the last election we did sixty-three percent of the
valid votes cast so I'll be looking for performance in terms of something
better than sixty-three percent but uh you just can't pinpoint the figure
because perception is like love and if you have been loved how deep or how
deeply loved are you how do you measure it you see so it's a public
perception

<ICE-SIN:S1B-045#24:1:B>
Whether sixty-three is considered a strong endorsement and uh
number of seats won or lost I think there's a combination of factors the
quality of the results but when you see the results you will know whether it
is clear or not clear

<ICE-SIN:S1B-045#25:1:B>
If you are in love you know whether you are in love or not

<$E> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-045#26:1:E>
And if you have to measure it you can't be

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-045#27:1:B>
If you have to measure it yah you can't be in love you pretend
to be in love

<$F> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-045#28:1:F>
If you do not get the endorsement you're looking for or how
will that how will that affect your plans specifically your plans for calling
by-elections within twelve to eighteen months

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-045#29:1:B>
Well uh first let me clarify you know 'cos some reporters
thought that my last statement at a dialogue session at Moulmein was a bit of
a threat when I said that if I receive a weak signal I may have to go a
little slow on uh Medisave and Ed Medifund and Edusave

<ICE-SIN:S1B-045#30:1:B>
Now I believe in the program so even if I get a weak signal I will
still campaign with my colleagues with the public to implement the pro in the
uh the program

<ICE-SIN:S1B-045#31:1:B>
It must be I believe in them

<$G> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-045#32:1:G>
Uhm there was a BBC interview earlier uh last week which said
that if you won by a narrow margin there would be a groundswell within the
party for BG Lee to take over

<ICE-SIN:S1B-045#33:1:G>
Uh would you like to elaborate on that

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-045#34:1:B>
Well I think the foreign press they would always like to play
one against another which is why I have BG Lee here today to show that uh the
swell is with me

<$H> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-045#35:1:H>
Mr Goh I don't mean to be ? ? if the public would be
interested worst case scenario if let's say the PAP does lose all remaining
seats forty seats you say you would consider or should step down

<ICE-SIN:S1B-045#36:1:H>
If that's the case if that happens do you have a narrow parent who
is he and is he ready

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-045#37:1:B>
I have not contemplated such horrors

<ICE-SIN:S1B-045#38:1:B>
It must be because my judgement is that this is a good time to call
for election and I'm seeking you know a strong endorsement for my program so
that thought hasn't crossed my mind at all

<$E> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-045#39:1:E>
Furthermore the PAP has not had its steps it's one team and if
you will do that it's a rejection of the whole team not of one man

<$I> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-045#40:1:I>
Could you explain your approach to spending the reserves uh
and is it very different from the approach of the old government

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-045#41:1:B>
Now the spare reserves means to use up to consume reserves
that's not what we are going to do

<ICE-SIN:S1B-045#42:1:B>
What we have in mind is to use reserves for particular purpose

<ICE-SIN:S1B-045#43:1:B>
Now we are not going to use ten billion of our reserves we start
off with one billion for Edusave and thereafter the funds must be accumulated
from economic growth and future surpluses

<ICE-SIN:S1B-045#44:1:B>
We didn't want to wait to accumulate the one billion because we
thought education is a good thing start off immediately

<ICE-SIN:S1B-045#45:1:B>
Now this is using reserves it's not using up reserves it's not
spending reserves it's taking out one billion which is under the control of
Finance Ministry put aside into a dedicated account called Education
Endowment Fund or Edusave and that account will be managed by the Board of
Trustees concerned with education

<ICE-SIN:S1B-045#46:1:B>
The revenue from that account will be used for the students not the
principals

<ICE-SIN:S1B-045#47:1:B>
In other words we're trying to rear two golden geese one called the
Edusave goose the other one uh Medifund goose and you don't slaughter your
golden goose

<$E> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-045#48:1:E>
That's to prevent anybody from cutting their necks some more

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-045#49:1:B>
That's to prevent others cutting off the necks of the geese
but the eggs will be distributed that's what we are doing

<$I> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-045#50:1:I>
This is just a follow-up question uh if you're not using uh
the reserves as it were uh why is it important uh for you to to get a clear
mandate from from from the people

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-045#51:1:B>
Well uh it's not just just a mandate for a change in the way
of using reserves it's a mandate for the whole program and the program is a
major program it is a very big uh program a major initiative on my part in
aimed primarily at the pocket of population to level up the population

<ICE-SIN:S1B-045#52:1:B>
Over the last few years our program was aimed primarily at the able
the talented in society independent schools gifted program for very able
children income tax uh deductions for the professionals so I'm trying to
level up our society by having this program aimed in at the pocket of
population

<ICE-SIN:S1B-045#53:1:B>
I want to have an endorsement on the way I think on my philosophy
on the direction I'm taking and that involves using reserves for the two
funds but not using up reserves I will repeat that

<ICE-SIN:S1B-045#54:1:B>
The Next Lap is not just about uh Edusave or Medifund it's also
about the Arts how do we have a more vibrant cultural environment uh for
Singaporeans to express themselves

<ICE-SIN:S1B-045#55:1:B>
George has been thinking quite deeply on this issue so maybe you
may want to say a few works on this

<$J> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-045#56:1:J>
We want refreshing aspects of Mr Goh Chok Tong's leadership is
that he gives us more space to exercise our initiative to do the things which
we want to do and therefore to make more creative contributions to the larger
process

<ICE-SIN:S1B-045#57:1:J>
One important aspect which we need to overcome is how to increase
our charm at all levels

<ICE-SIN:S1B-045#58:1:J>
It may seem facile it may seem trivial but I would say that the
ability of the government or leaders of Singapore as a whole to be more
charming it's very important

<ICE-SIN:S1B-045#59:1:J>
It affects our ability to be creative and to create to market and
to encourage others to make use of our facilities to encourage others to come
to Singapore to encourage others to settle here

<ICE-SIN:S1B-045#60:1:J>
So the arts the creative industries are essential parts of this new
Singapore that we're talking

<ICE-SIN:S1B-045#61:1:J>
I mean charm is very important it's not just Edusave it's not just
Medifund it's not just the SCS because in this world that we are going into
power is more diffuse soft power is as important as hard power and our
ability to woo to charm to enthuse is very important and Mr Goh's leadership
in the Next Lap ushers in such a phase for Singapore

<$K> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-045#62:1:K>
Are you happy with the majority that this party asks for

<ICE-SIN:S1B-045#63:1:K>
Are you concerned that it could be perceived as a majority by
people because voters in the walk-over constituencies will never get a chance
to exercise their votes

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-045#64:1:B>
No personally I would have preferred more seats to be
contested because we have so many new candidates and there's nothing like uh
putting a new candidates through the paces but uh that's over so there's no
point talking about uh what it should be or should not be

<$L> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-045#65:1:L>
We will not take we will not take our voters for granted no we
should not

<ICE-SIN:S1B-045#66:1:L>
We'll work very hard we don't take them for granted we will not
take them for granted we'll work very hard to win their votes

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-045#67:1:B>
Uh that's correct because if you take your voters for granted
then uh they would also tell you that you have taken them for granted in a
very painful way right

<ICE-SIN:S1B-045#68:1:B>
Thank you

<$M> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-045#69:1:M>
The Workers' Party on the other hand ask why the elections are
being held so soon

<ICE-SIN:S1B-045#70:1:M>
Its main spokesman was J.B. Jeyaratnam who's disqualified from
contesting this election

<$N> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-045#71:1:N>
Why are they necessary at this particular point of time

<ICE-SIN:S1B-045#72:1:N>
Is the country facing an economic recession that the government has
to bring in drastic measures and so they think we'd better go back to the
people and explain to them

<ICE-SIN:S1B-045#73:1:N>
Or is there some na national you know calamity that is staring at
us in the face and for which the government wants to be prepared and
therefore wants the people to back to give them a mandate

<ICE-SIN:S1B-045#74:1:N>
We had you know I'm sorry to say just shibboleth from the PAP on
the need for this elections

<ICE-SIN:S1B-045#75:1:N>
As far as the party is concerned and particularly my concern is to
bring down the PAP's share of the vote

<ICE-SIN:S1B-045#76:1:N>
Now come on they're clearly going to be in the government and
there's no question of we taking over and I hope that on the first of
September we will see that the PAP's vote has slumped from sixty to fifty six
fifty seven

<$M> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-045#77:1:M>
Mr Jeyaratnam also touched on Medisave and Edusave

<$N> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-045#78:1:N>
Those are of course important issues and we will tell the
people that these all this Medisave Edusave are not really designed and meant
to help those who are unable to provide for themselves <X>

<ICE-SIN:S1B-045#X79:1:N>
For the Singapore Democratic Party Chiam See Tong repeated his
call for a strong opposition as the PAP has been returned to government he's
confident the SDP's strategy of contesting this election as a by-election can
work We believe we have succeeded In fact we have completely succeeded We
cannot have a better uh pronouncement on Nomination Day What can we expect
Forty contested seats That's the maximum we can have It's beautiful It all
works to our advantage at this point of time So up to this point of time we
are taking the SDP and the opposition are taking the initiative not uh
People's Action Party In the past they've always taken the initiative they've
introduced issues and we were all led by the nose and get dragged into
arguments with them on the issue which they have chosen In other words we
have gone to contest with them on the grounds and in the circumstances uh in
which they have chosen Of course we get slaughtered we get defeated but now
it's it's different It's no harm failing but we learn from our failures from
our lessons So we are taking them on now on our terms not their terms and I
believe the people of Singapore are behind us Well that's how the strategy
for some of the parties has been shaping up </X> </I>
