<h> REMNANTS OF AN ANCIENT PARADISE KHATIB BONGSU, HOME OF THE
BLACK-CROWNED NIGHT-HERONS </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-029#4:1>
The very houses that we live in, on any part of this island, were once
the rightful homes of an incredible variety of birds that flew wild and free.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-029#5:1>
I cannot visualise that the block of flats which I now live near the
fringe of Yishun New Town was, like a few other bird haunts in Singapore, an
age-old haven for teeming thousands of Black-crowned Night-herons, Purple
Herons and countless species of other wild birds.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-029#6:1>
My home is only 1 kilometre from Khatib Bongsu, the remnant of an
ancient paradise that once must have spread all over the coastal region of
Singapore.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-029#7:1>
It is my morning ritual before I leave for work, to gaze at the
remnant of this ancient marvel that spreads itself right before my eyes at my
front door.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-029#8:1>
Beyond lies the blue-green mountains of West Malaysia.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-029#9:1>
About a thousand Black-crowned Night-herons and a dozen of Purple
Herons adorn an almost forgotten cluster of ageless mangroves that stands
frozen on the edge of extinction, in the middle of a prawn pond next to a
Buddhist Temple.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-029#10:1>
No other bird sights - and this is certainly the last - in Singapore
holds such a unique spectacle as Khatib Bongsu where the Night-herons and
Purple Herons nest, feed and perform breath-taking acrobatic displays right
before our eyes, as if we are part of their family.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-029#11:1>
Every evening when I return home from work, I see them flying over my
flat to their coastal feeding grounds at Senoko, Punggol and possibly, even
across to West Malaysia.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-029#12:1>
Khatib Bongsu radiates a certain magic both in sight and sound to all
visitors.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-029#13:1>
The Night-herons and Purple Herons nest almost side by side,
competing for flying space.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-029#14:1>
The continuous woking and quacking of the birds echoing cries from
the dim mist of time produce a pleasant music that is soothing to the ears.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-029#15:1>
The only other known colony of the Black-crowned Night-herons in
this region is in Perak, West Malaysia.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-029#16:1>
Over my three-year period of photography of the Night-herons, I
realised that they nest at all times of the year, fetching and carrying
sticks throughout the daylight hours, especially during the first four hours
after sunrise.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-029#17:1>
The male Night-heron does the fetching of twigs and sticks to the
nest site and passes them over to the female which assembles the materials
with utmost care and perfection.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-029#18:1>
A home may take about two weeks to complete.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-029#19:1>
Two to three eggs are usually laid and fresh leaves are carried to
the nest after hatching to give it a soft padding.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-029#20:1>
The parents feed the young with regurgitated shrimps or small fish
and often, a hungry chick is an angry creature, pecking at the feeding adult
with its wide-opened bill, some forcing it to flee.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-029#21:1>
The female never leaves the nest until the growing chicks outgrow it,
and she is finally pushed out of the nest.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-029#22:1>
The young usually remain in the nest for about a month whereby it
will learn how to fly.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-029#23:1>
I once saw a young fall from its nest into the pond and, well, it
swam back safely to the mangroves!

<ICE-SIN:W2B-029#24:1>
Amazing though it may be, it must be nature's way of ensuring their
survival.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-029#25:1>
I have seen fairly young birds pair off even before they assume the
plumage of adulthood which is grey at the wings, dark on the head with a
white crest.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-029#26:1>
The juveniles, in contrast, take on a rather speckled brown
appearance.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-029#27:1>
Life begins in full bloom at dusk when their " woking" cries radiate
over the land.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-029#28:1>
They take off to their feeding grounds in flocks of ten, twenty or
more at a time, around the coastal region.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-029#29:1>
They return in the early hours of the morning and this period holds
the most exciting activities.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-029#30:1>
During the migratory months, Little Egrets from the surrounding
wetlands roost at their nesting haunts among the mangroves when they embark
upon their nightly pilgrimage to the coastal areas.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-029#31:1>
There seem to be an age-old understanding between these two species
of winged creatures.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-029#32:1>
Crows, Brahminy kites and occasionally other birds of prey eye upon
this rich concentration of young birds.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-029#33:1>
Needless to say, they provide an easy meal and the parents of the
Night-herons have to stay on guard against the natural predators.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-029#34:1>
Brahminy Kites sometimes commit acts of " infant robbery".

<ICE-SIN:W2B-029#35:1>
The crows come in organised gangs of up to 80 birds to harass the
nesting Night-herons, usually in the late mornings and evenings.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-029#36:1>
In the evening, the bulk of the Night-herons leave home for their
coastal feeding grounds.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-029#37:1>
nesting females sit tight until the young are old enough to learn how
to fly.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-029#38:1>
During this time the male is the important life-line for he brings
food to the nest.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-029#39:1>
Nest-building, feeding, aerial courtship displays and territorial
squabbles take up a lot of their time during the active hours of the morning.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-029#40:1>
The intense heat of the afternoon usually drive them to hide amongst
the thick mangrove foliage.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-029#41:1>
As evening falls, they become active again.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-029#42:1>
This cycle has governed their life since their very existence long,
long ago.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-029#43:1>
It has earned these nocturnal travellers the name, " Night-herons".

<ICE-SIN:W2B-029#44:1>
Besides the Black-crowned Night-herons, the other exciting community
is that of the Purple Herons.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-029#45:1>
A graceful bird, it soars the sky with its broad wings and is rather
inactive at night.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-029#46:1>
There are at least half a dozen nesting pairs of Purple Herons at
Khatib Bongsu and they occupy the higher tree tops which are located further
away from human presence as they ten very shy.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-029#47:1>
Like the Black-crowned Night-herons, the males are entrusted with the
tasks of stick-fetching.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-029#48:1>
The young stay in the nest till they are about three months old.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-029#49:1>
They will depend on their parents for food even after that, lingering
near their nest sites.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-029#50:1>
By the fifth month, they can fend for themselves and they follow
their parents to their favourite hunting grounds.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-029#51:1>
Soon they will be independent of their parents and like them, will
raise their own family in the mangroves of Khatib Bongsu.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-029#52:1>
<h> A LITTLE HIDING PLACE </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-029#53:1>
In the quiet stillness of a warm April day, looming high amongst the
gentle sway of the fronds, dangles the hanging homes of the Baya Weavers.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-029#54:1>
The warm mid-year wind is already here and while the wetlands echo
the silence of the bird habitats, now with only a few White-winged Terns in
their dark-breasted summer plumage which have refused to return to their
Northern home, the trees suddenly seem to come alive.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-029#55:1>
The Baya Weavers are yet again raising their new families.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-029#56:1>
Industrious and unrelenting males work throughout the daylight hours,
fetching long grass to make " helmet-shaped" nests to attract the females.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-029#57:1>
One male can build several nests to entice several mates
simultaneously nests.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-029#58:1>
Polygamy, after all, is a way of life for the survival of the
species.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-029#59:1>
Heavily dependent on grass seeds for their source of food, Baya
Weavers usually gather in colonies of up to 30 nests.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-029#60:1>
Woodpeckers peck and pound the dead tree trunks, adorning them with
an artistry of drilled holes of various dimensions.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-029#61:1>
Of the five species of Woodpeckers here, the smallest of them is the
Browned-capped Woodpecker, slightly shorter than a 15-cm ruler, with the
Cornmon Goldenback, Laced Woodpeck Banded Woodpecker and Rufous Woodpecker
varying between the sizes of 25 cm to 30 cm.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-029#62:1>
Woodpeckers are not the sole inhabitants of the dead tree trunks.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-029#63:1>
Competition for shell lead to other birds chasing them out of their
holes.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-029#64:1>
In some cases, the Collared Kingfishers, with their unmistakable
shrieking cries, too, make their homes on abandoned woodpeckers' homes.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-029#65:1>
Even the common Mynas sometimes rob the woodpeckers of their nests to
make them their own.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-029#66:1>
But the Barbets work on their own homes and we have two species here.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-029#67:1>
One, the Red crowned Barbet, is largely confined to forest habitats,
especially around our reservoir areas.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-029#68:1>
The other, the Coppersmith Barbet, is more easily located in nature
parks and the surrounding islands like St John's Island.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-029#69:1>
Red-crowned Barbets make rather hesitant " poop-poop" sounds,
followed by 10-15 " poops" while the Coppersmith Barbets emit a mellow and
monotonous " poop".

<ICE-SIN:W2B-029#70:1>
Now and then, we may find one or two Cockatoos flying over our nature
parks.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-029#71:1>
A pair used to make its home on top of a tree at Sentosa Island seven
years ago.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-029#72:1>
Very likely an escaped species, it has since adapted to the living
conditions in the wild here.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-029#73:1>
Our tree-dwelling birds are plentiful and they can be found almost
everywhere, especially in gardens and parks.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-029#74:1>
The Black-naped Oriole's strikingly brilliant yellow plumage with
side dark bands around the eye and an orange beak, makes it a colourful
handsome bird.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-029#75:1>
Its mellow whistling calls make soothing music even in the noisy
confusion of the city.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-029#76:1>
A fruit-eating bird, it is found wherever there are fruit trees
throughout the island.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-029#77:1>
Another common fruit-eating bird is the Philippine Clossy Starlings.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-029#78:1>
Their impressive black feathers change to a metallic dark blue when
caught in the sun at certain angles.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-029#79:1>
Coupled with the flaming red eyes, the bird takes on an impressive
appearance.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-029#80:1>
Yellow-vented Bulbuls, too, often compete for fruits in the trees
together with their distant cousin, the Olive-winged Bulbuls, a much rarer
bird.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-029#81:1>
Sunbirds, Flower-peckers and Ioras are usually found where there are
flowering trees and plants, especially so in isolated areas like forests and
the remaining undisturbed habitats.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-029#82:1>
Sunbirds and Flower-peckers are some of the most beautiful birds on
our island.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-029#83:1>
We have six species of sunbirds, all sized between 10 to 14 cm, of
which the now increasingly rare Crimson Sunbird is the most spectacular with
its brilliant crimson breast, a shining purplish forehead and tail.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-029#84:1>
Purple-throated Sunbirds and Crimson Sunbirds are not commonly found
throughout the island.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-029#85:1>
However, the Mandai Orchid Garden seems to be one of the few places
which these birds frequent.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-029#86:1>
The most commonly found of our sunbirds is the Olive-backed Sunbird
and they can even be encountered in the heart of industrial complexes
wherever there are flowering Callistemon, Erythrina or Russelia plants.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-029#87:1>
The Orange-bellied Flower-pecker and Scarlet-backed Flower-pecker
not only feed on nectar but on small insects as well.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-029#88:1>
<h> MUSIC EVERYWHERE </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-029#89:1>
Songs of birds are everywhere in the wild.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-029#90:1>
Up in the air, deep in the forests, down on the earth and deep in the
burrows.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-029#91:1>
Night and day, rain or shine our feathered friends never fail to
bring sweet music to our land.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-029#92:1>
The most familiar tune is that of the Spotted Dove or " merbok" as it
is locally called, with their rolling whistled " coorroo-a-coo", repeated
about eight times.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-029#93:1>
In the long grasses, shrubs and vegetations of our fast-vanishing
rural areas at Yishun, Sembawang, Changi and off-shore islands like Pulau
Ubin and St John's Island, thrive many species of small birds which make a
medley of sweet melodies.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-029#94:1>
The most commonly heard song of the grassland is that of the
Yellow-bellied Prinia that sings a lovely distinctive " chip-cheererere-up"
tune.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-029#95:1>
Occasionally, one also hears the rather coarse and halting utterances
of the Pied Fantail.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-029#96:1>
When pursuing insects it would sound like "
chup-chupchup-choo-woot-cheweet-choowoot".

<ICE-SIN:W2B-029#97:1>
And then, there are the Tailorbirds of which we have four species.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-029#98:1>
The Common Tailorbird would sing " chweep-chweep-chweep", the
Dark-necked Tailor bird produces a disyllabic " koo-chit koo-chit", the
Rufous-tailed Tailorbird calls " kuachi-kuachi-kuachi", while the Ashy
Tailorbird would make " pree, pree, pree".

<ICE-SIN:W2B-029#99:1>
But there is one sound which they all make when chasing insects and
that is " zit-zit".

<ICE-SIN:W2B-029#100:1>
The Lesser Coucal and Greater Coucal emit tunes quite similar to the
pronunciation of their names like 'hup-hup, t-t-tok" for the former and "
boop, boop boop" for the latter.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-029#101:1>
As a layman, it is quite impossible for us to identify the exact
bird by hearing their vocal cords, although it is quite unusual for someone
not to be able to make out the caws of the crows or the screeches of the
Mynas.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-029#102:1>
The melodious whistlings of the Magpie Robin hold such special magic
that they make just cannot be spelled out. <X>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-029#X103:1>
Tragically, their numbers have declined so badly there are only
about 20 left outside captivity.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-029#X104:1>
There may not be any songs of the Magpie Robin that are sung wild
and free anymore. </X> </I>
