Chapter 1 <h> Magic in Malay Myths </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-018#4:1>
Malinowski calls myths which endow the performance of magic with worth
and validity as myths of magic.(l) Central to this type of myths is a
conception of a world which makes no consistent demarcation between its
separate realms.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-018#5:1>
For example, Hikayat Merong Mahawangsa, a Kedah annals whose date of
authorship is unknown, opens with a magical world in which animals can speak
and interfere in the affairs of man, where rain, thunder and lightning can be
brought down at will and where arrows can turn into flame.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-018#6:1>
( 2)The well-known Malay chronicle, Sejarah Melayu, written most
probably in the latter half of the sixteenth century, relates the story of
Raja Suran descending into the ocean.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-018#7:1>
There he discovers a kingdom, marries a princess, and has children.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-018#8:1>
He returns from the ocean on a flying horse.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-018#9:1>
His three sons return to the Malay world riding a white sacred cow.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-018#10:1>
Their arrival at Bukit Siguntang Mahameru turns padi grains into
gold, leaves into silver and stems into gold alloy.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-018#11:1>
And from the spew of the cow emerges a man called Bat.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-018#12:1>
( 3) Free movement between heaven and earth is related in Hikayat
Hang Tuah, a court epic written in the early eighteenth century.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-018#13:1>
The text relates the story of a heavenly king who descends to earth
and marries a mortal princess.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-018#14:1>
The king and his consort later return to the heavenly kingdom,
leaving their son Sang Sapurba to rule the earth.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-018#15:1>
Sang Sapurba meets a princess whose origin is from the spew of a
white cow.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-018#16:1>
To inform his parents of his proposed marriage to thc magical
princess, Sang Sapurba commands one of his ministers to ascend to the
heavenly kingdom.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-018#17:1>
His parents frequently descend to earth to visit their grandchildren.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-018#18:1>
( 4) In the tale, Bukit Siguntang functions as the center of the
world where heaven and earth converge.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-018#19:1>
( 5) In the mythical world of the Malay historical narrative, the
manner of demarcating phenomena like heaven and earth, land and sea, man and
animal, animate and inanimate, the natural and the supernatural does not
conform to empirical observation.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-018#20:1>
The mode of thinking giving rise to such classification is described
by Ernst Cassirer as being governed by the " characteristic law of the
concrescence or coincidence of the members of a relation" ( 6) and is thus
indifferent to the various levels of objectivization, which are distinguished
by empirical thinking.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-018#21:1>
( 7) The law of the concrescence or coincidence of the members of a
relation referred to by Cassirer, in explaining a mythical mode of thinking,
is based or the law of sympathetic magic discussed by Edward Tylor and
developed by James Frazer.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-018#22:1>
Frazer' s theory of magic is relevant to our study of the Malay myths
of magic.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-018#23:1>
He distinguished between magic and religion as well as between magic
anc science.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-018#24:1>
Magic seeks to compel the world of the supernatural to do its
bidding.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-018#25:1>
The failure to get results is attributed to errors of procedure or to
a stronger counter - magic being brought to bear.(8) It involves the element
of coercion or constraint as opposed to religion, which involves the element
of propitiation or conciliation of powers superior to man, believed to direct
and control the course of nature and of human life.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-018#26:1>
( 9) Frazer is not the only one to make such a distinction between
magic and religion.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-018#27:1>
Van Baal notes that in all forms of magic, early investigators
noticed an element of compulsion or automatic effectiveness due to the
skilful manipulation of esoteric knowledge which has so little to do with
humility or dependence on supernatural beings.(10) Van Baal himself defines
magic as " ritual acts, preferably of a simple character, executed to promote
the realization of a concrete end".

<ICE-SIN:W2A-018#28:1>
ll On the distinction between religion and magic, he says: " The
actions of superhuman beings must be incalculable as such, and their power
necessarily invites an attitude of dependence among the believers, an
attitude flatly contradicted by a magician's reliance on strict procedure."

<ICE-SIN:W2A-018#29:1>
<h> ( 12)The Compounding of Magic and Religion </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-018#30:1>
In many Malay myths magic and religion are not distinguished.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-018#31:1>
The two elements seem to blend.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-018#32:1>
A good example of this is the myth on the conversion of Pasai and
Malacca to Islam.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-018#33:1>
In both cases both the rulers of Malacca and Pasai were converted to
Islam through dreams in which they met the Prophet Muhammad.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-018#34:1>
The description of the dream in Hikayat RajaRaja Pasai ( Pasai
Chronicles) is as follows: " He ( Merah Silu) saw a person standing, his chin
cupped in his hand; his eyes covered by his four fingers.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-018#35:1>
The person said, 'Merah Silu, recite the words of the profession of
faith.' 'I do not know how to recite them,' replied Merah Silu.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-018#36:1>
'Open your mouth,' said the person.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-018#37:1>
Merah Silu opened his mouth and the person spat into it.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-018#38:1>
The taste was rich and sweet.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-018#39:1>
Then he said to Merah Silu, 'Your name shall be Sultan Maliku'l
Saleh.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-018#40:1>
From now on your are a Muslim and will recite the words of the
profession of faith ....

<ICE-SIN:W2A-018#41:1>
In forty days' time a ship will arrive from Mecca.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-018#42:1>
The words spoken by the people on board and all their observances
which are in accordance with the institution of Islam, these you must follow
without deviation.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-018#43:1>
And you must obey all their instructions.' On waking, Merah Silu
discovered that he had been circumcized and was able to read the thirty
sections of the Quran without a single fault.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-018#44:1>
And the ship arrived to formalise the proselytization."

<ICE-SIN:W2A-018#45:1>
( l3) A similar myth I related in Sejarah Melayu.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-018#46:1>
( l4)These myths represent a fusion of magical and religious
elements.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-018#47:1>
Another example of the lack of distinction between magic and religion
is the myth concerning the origin of Malay rulers.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-018#48:1>
In Sejarah Melayu, the Malay rulers trace their lineage to two main
ancestors.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-018#49:1>
One is Raja Iskanda or Alexander the Great, a historical personality
alleged to have been religiously appointed by God to rule the kingdom on
earth,'(15) and the other Sang Sapurba, a magical ancestor who ascended from
the ocean.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-018#50:1>
The magical and the religious ancestors are included in the same
genealogy without an awareness of the contradiction between the two.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-018#51:1>
R.R.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-018#52:1>
Marett argues that magic has anti-social possibilities, as opposed to
religion which is always approved by the group.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-018#53:1>
He states that it is possible to treat magic as a general name for
all the bad kinds of trafficking with the occult and supra-sensible in vogue
in a given society, while conversely, religion may be taken to comprehend all
the good kinds of such trafficking.(l6) He further states that it is religion
that has all the organization to itself, because public approval affords it
every chance of free expansion.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-018#54:1>
Magic, on the other hand, as the enemy of organized cult and, indeed,
of the social organization as a whole, must lurk in dark places.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-018#55:1>
( l7)Garett's observation of magic, however, is true only for evil
magic'(18 which is usually practised in private.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-018#56:1>
This is not the case for public magic.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-018#57:1>
Public magic is considered beneficent magic practised in order to
secure benefits for the community as a whole.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-018#58:1>
It is usually employed for healing purposes or to promote human
activities like hunting, fishing, gardening and determining the weather.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-018#59:1>
In the Malay feudal courts, magic was given state recognition.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-018#60:1>
It was sanctioned by rulers, performed and practised in the court.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-018#61:1>
Magicians enjoyed high status in court life.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-018#62:1>
They were accepted as part and parcel of court life and encouraged to
exhibit their magical prowess.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-018#63:1>
For example a certain Saiyid, a man of Arab descent, helped a ruler
of Malacca defeat Siam by shooting an arrow from Malacca in the direction of
Siam, which by thought and desire was believed to have killed the king of
Siam.(l9) The act of sorcery in this instance was not practised in the dark
but in the open.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-018#64:1>
A certain Yogi performed magical acrobatics before Sultan Ahmad of
Pasai with his approval.(20) Sometimes Malay rulers were themselves portrayed
as magicians who demonstrated their magical abilities publicly to illustrate
their superiority over others.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-018#65:1>
Examples of this are seen in the story of Sultan Mansur, who dipped
his feet into the water which was then drunk by the ruler of China, which
cured the latter's skin disease,(2l) and of the myth of Sang Sapurba, who was
able to convert sea water into fresh water by dipping his feet in it.(22)

<ICE-SIN:W2A-018#66:1>
<h> The Law of Sympathy Underlying Magic </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-018#67:1>
It is generally believed by scholars that magic works according to
certain laws or is based upon an association of ideas.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-018#68:1>
ln this respect, magic is considered to be akin to science.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-018#69:1>
Frazer calls the law governing magic as the law of sympathy.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-018#70:1>
Two principles make up this law.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-018#71:1>
One is the law of similarity which gives rise to homeopathic or
imitative magic and the other the law of contact which underlies contagious
magic.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-018#72:1>
The law of similarity assumes that like equals to like or that an
effect resembles cause.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-018#73:1>
The law of contact assumes that a part is equal to its whole or that
things which have once been in physical contact with one another continue to
act on one another, even after the contact has been severed.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-018#74:1>
From the first principle, namely the law of similarity, the magician
infers that he can produce a effect he desires merely by imitating it.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-018#75:1>
From the second, he infers that whatever he does to a material object
will similarly affect those that the object has been in contact with,
regardless of whether it forms part of his body or not.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-018#76:1>
( 23)Examples of imitative magic at work are the myths concerning the
foundation of cities.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-018#77:1>
Pasai, Samudera and Singapura were named after a dog, an ant and a
lion respectively.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-018#78:1>
It is a mythical mode of reasoning which considers the display of
courage, strength and tenacity by these creatures not only propitious signs
but also as an argument that cities built on the very spots where the animals
appear will actually draw qualities exhibited by these creatures.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-018#79:1>
The reasoning runs follows: As the animals display positive
qualities, by principle of like producing like, so will the cities.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-018#80:1>
Logically speaking, there is no causal connection between the sudden
appearance of the animal, their display of positive qualities by the
creatures and the subsequent character of the cities.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-018#81:1>
However, it is the illogicality of magico - mythical thinking that
leads to such false association of ideas through the law of sympathy.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-018#82:1>
A similar mode of thinking can be discerned in Maharaja Dewa Sura,
the ruler of Pahang captured and imprisoned by the king of Malacca, when he
attributed the defeat of his country to the missing nail of his favourite
elephant.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-018#83:1>
Sejarah Melayu relates the following: " It happened one day, after
Maharaja Sura had been imprisoned for some while, that the elephant Ya
Kenyang was led past the prison-cage on his way down the river to be bathed.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-018#84:1>
Sri Maharaja Sura called him and when the elephant came to him, he
examined him and perceived that one of his nails was missing.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-018#85:1>
And he said, 'To think that after all these years this is the first
time I have looked at my own elephant like this.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-018#86:1>
No wonder I lost my country.'

<ICE-SIN:W2A-018#87:1>
( 24) In contagious magic, on the other hand, the whole and the part
share a contiguity that is in no way disturbed by separation.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-018#88:1>
A whole person can be reconstituted from one of his parts.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-018#89:1>
In a battle with a Malaccan warrior named Hang Tuah, Sang Winara, a
Majapahit warrior was slain by the former.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-018#90:1>
His decapitated head, still alive, fled from the village and was
rescued by four disciple warriors.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-018#91:1>
In a will he left his disciples, he ordered that his head be buried
at the foot of a mountain and be dug out after seven years.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-018#92:1>
He would then return to life.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-018#93:1>
( 25)The resurrection of the whole from the part also implies that
life force resides in different parts of the person. <X>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-018#X94:1>
Hikayat Raja-Raja Pasai relates how the soul or spirit of Princess
Betung was locked in a single thread of her golden hair.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-018#X95:1>
When Merah Silu, the ruler of Pasai, plucked it out during her
sleep, " blood poured out of the hole where the hair had been - white blood
which went on pouring out continuously.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-018#X96:1>
At last the flow of the blood stopped.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-018#X97:1>
But by that time the princess was dead.(26) Here the personality of
a being is considered indivisible, residing as a whole in each of its
parts.(27) </X> </I>
