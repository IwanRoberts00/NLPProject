<h> Preface </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-023#4:1>
A whole generation of Singaporeans is growing up with little idea of
the fecundity of the flora and fauna of their country.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-023#5:1>
Their familiarity is that of the concrete jungle.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-023#6:1>
Hence, the primary objective of this book is to increase the awareness
of what is still available in our natural environment; for with awareness
will come appreciation and respect for nature.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-023#7:1>
This book will provide information for those who take an occasional
nature hike or those who feel they must know more about the environment we
live in.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-023#8:1>
For those who have never ventured into the forests, let this book
serve as an eye-opener to the natural habitat.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-023#9:1>
The second objective is to plead for conservation of our natural
heritage, a pertinent issue in our land-scarce island and in a world fraught
with drought, floods, famine, pollution and other effects of environmental
abuse and degradation.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-023#10:1>
The third objective is to give financial support to the Nature
Society ( Singapore) ( NSS).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-023#11:1>
Much of the work in this book was carried out on the various outings
organised by the society with members who share a common dream - - that the
natural habitats and the rich wildlife be left undisturbed for future
generations.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-023#12:1>
This book does not attempt to provide details or exhibit the full
range of the species available.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-023#13:1>
These are adequately covered in some of the references listed and,
indeed, many species remain unidentified.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-023#14:1>
Although attempts are made to place the flora and fauna in the
habitats where they are generally found, being dynamic organisms, they can
also be seen in many different parts of the island.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-023#15:1>
There is, however, no substitute for viewing all this in the natural
state as no photograph can adequately convey the fascination of the moment.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-023#16:1>
Perhaps these pictures will help convey the complexity of the forms
and colours in nature and stimulate readers to explore for themselves what
Singapore has to offer.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-023#17:1>
Intrigued by what we see, we are often tempted to touch or collect.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-023#18:1>
It is our fervent hope that as readers discover for themselves the
flora and fauna here, they will learn to leave them in their natural state.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-023#19:1>
<h> Introduction </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-023#20:1>
Before the landing of Stamford Raffles in 1819, Singapore was a
largely uninhabited island with lush tropical rainforests and coastal
mangrove swamps.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-023#21:1>
The establishment of a trading post saw the introduction of
plantation crops like gambier, pepper, cloves, nutmeg, sugar cane and
pineapple, with thousands of hectares of the forest being cleared to make way
for their cultivation.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-023#22:1>
Rubber was experimented with and when the demand for it soared, as
much as 22,200 hectares were set aside for its cultivation.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-023#23:1>
Other forested areas were cleared for housing and recreational needs.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-023#24:1>
The destruction of forests often rendered the land useless for
cultivation.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-023#25:1>
Left unprotected, it bore the brunt of the erosive forces of rain
water, the nutrients were leached and the earth loosened and washed away.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-023#26:1>
Many of these areas degenerated into grassland.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-023#27:1>
Mangrove forests were similarly obliterated for industrial use.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-023#28:1>
In 1884 there were about 5,000 ha of forests.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-023#29:1>
From an island virtually covered with forest, today, only about 700
ha remain, 100 ha of primary forest and 600 ha mangrove forest.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-023#30:1>
Together with the secondary forest of the Central Catchment Area (
1,600 ha) and pockets in other parts of Singapore, they make up only 4.5% of
the island's land area.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-023#31:1>
It was fortunate that the present Bukit Timah Nature Reserve was less
accessible and spared from logging.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-023#32:1>
The forests of the Central Catchment Area were once heavily logged
but, with protection due to its importance as a water catchment area, much
has regenerated.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-023#33:1>
Careful and maximal use of land can help balance what should be
developed and what should be retained.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-023#34:1>
It is heartening that within the limited forested areas left in
Singapore, one can still marvel at the butterflies and birds in their
splendour of colours, still be awed by the myriad of insects and captivated
by the intricate forms and beauty of the plants, their fruits and flowers.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-023#35:1>
However, much has been irretrievably lost.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-023#36:1>
Destruction and fragmentation of the forests spelled extinction for
many species of animals that lost their natural habitats.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-023#37:1>
Unless we all try to protect and save what remains, there is no
guarantee that the wildlife left in Singapore will not just vanish overnight
as a result of callous thought and with the din of bulldozers.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-023#38:1>
The tropical rainforest is one of the richest natural environments in
the world.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-023#39:1>
The animal and plant life in the forests have taken hundreds of years
to evolve and are irreplaceable.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-023#40:1>
The valuable natural habitat must be retained to support the
ecosystem within which the wildlife strikes a complicated and symbiotic
balance.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-023#41:1>
Many insects depend on plants for their survival.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-023#42:1>
Nectar of flowers is consumed by butterflies, bees and wasps; leaves
are devoured by grasshoppers, while caterpillars, cicadas and bugs extract
the sap from branches and stems, and larva of beetles and scorpions live
around tree trunks.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-023#43:1>
In the process, insects help to pollinate the flowers, thus
propagating the plants.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-023#44:1>
Fruits are eaten by birds and mammals which disperse the seeds so
that future plant generations can be established in more distant areas.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-023#45:1>
Fauna and flora make complimentary demands on each other and this
delicate equilibrium is maintained by the endless cycle of nature.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-023#46:1>
The marine ecosystem is also in danger.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-023#47:1>
The reclamation that has reshaped Singapore's coastline has destroyed
and seriously degraded marine life.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-023#48:1>
The high level of sedimentation as a result of land-filling is
obvious to those who dive.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-023#49:1>
This reduces sunlight penetration, and sunlight is a prerequisite for
coral growth.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-023#50:1>
At 6 metres, the reef slopes still exhibit good growth but beyond
that, there is none.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-023#51:1>
Studies in recent years reveal that there is a great diversity of
marine life that still thrive despite the odds, mostly around the southern
islands like Pulau Hantu and Pulau Semakau.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-023#52:1>
The very processes of development that ensures progress and greater
convenience in our lives, ironically, also hastens our doom.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-023#53:1>
The deleterious effects that accompany modern technology cannot be
ignored: toxic discharge from factories, the fumes of cars and the tons of
refuse disposed daily.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-023#54:1>
These degrade the water and air quality which further disrupt the
delicate food chain.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-023#55:1>
It makes one wonder in the face of relentless assault on the
environment, how long can human civilization survive?

<ICE-SIN:W2A-023#56:1>
Although there is currently a growth of environmental consciousness
that is heightened by the increasing depletion of the ozone layer and the
unrestrained destruction of the tropical rainforests, these crucial facts can
become mere catch-phrases with an over-familiar ring.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-023#57:1>
Recycling projects have not had the overwhelming support that they
should.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-023#58:1>
We sit back, waiting, either hoping for the ozone hole to heal or for
the ozone layer to be obliterated before we begin to act.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-023#59:1>
We watch forests being decimated and, until it is all gone, we will
never appreciate its importance.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-023#60:1>
Singapore has a population of 3 million and this number is increasing
to a target of 4 million.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-023#61:1>
Housing, food and social demands will consume even more land, further
depleting the natural habitat.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-023#62:1>
Although man-made gardens and parks help complement the green belt or
corridor, sustaining insects and some smaller species of wildlife, they
cannot sustain the island's rich fauna, particularly the larger mammals that
are threatened most with extinction.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-023#63:1>
It is important that we ensure the survival and continuance of the
ecosystems of the Bukit Timah Nature Reserve, the open grasslands, the
forests of the water catchment areas, the mangrove and freshwater swamps and
the marine and coral communities.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-023#64:1>
This natural habitat is our heritage.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-023#65:1>
It is a delicate and precious habitat threatened by irresponsible
actions.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-023#66:1>
The pictures in this book demonstrate the uniqueness of the life
around us, helping us to reflect on the inhabitants of our natural habitat.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-023#67:1>
<h> Ours to Protect </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-023#68:1>
With the world's population expected to double to 10 billion by 2050
( ST 14/5/91), what then lies ahead for future generations?

<ICE-SIN:W2A-023#69:1>
Uncontrolled population growth is one of the principal causes of
environmental degradation and habitat loss.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-023#70:1>
Development and environment imposes limits on each other.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-023#71:1>
In Singapore, it is no different.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-023#72:1>
Having achieved a standard of living near that of a developed nation,
we should now recognize the importance of conservation.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-023#73:1>
Although our forests are but a minuscule part of all the forests in
the world, its loss would be more profound considering that it is all we have
left.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-023#74:1>
Many new species of plants and animals are continually being
discovered here and around the world, but with constant erosion of natural
habitats, these will be extinct before we can even record or study them.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-023#75:1>
The Periwinkle plant from Madagascar, used in drugs for the treatment
of leukaemia and Hogkin's disease, is an example of the invaluable potential
of the forest to medical science.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-023#76:1>
The White Costus ( wild ginger) contains ingredients used in
contraception.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-023#77:1>
Pain relief from many common ailments is in the form of a widely used
drug, Aspirin.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-023#78:1>
This was first discovered in the bark of the Willow tree.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-023#79:1>
Cyclosporin, a drug that revolutionized organ transplants is
extracted from fungi.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-023#80:1>
The possibility of a forest tree ( Bintangor) being used to combat
Aids is still actively being studied.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-023#81:1>
Many other forest plants have been used as herbal cures.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-023#82:1>
The vaccine to cure leprosy was only possible by incubating the
bacilli in a mammal found in South America, the armadillo.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-023#83:1>
Other mammals may offer solutions to many perplexing medical
problems.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-023#84:1>
However, if their numbers are small, it will not avail them to
medical research, putting to rest any hope for finding a cure.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-023#85:1>
Their loss will be our loss.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-023#86:1>
It is heartening to note that the efforts of the Nature Society to
save natural habitats have not been in vain.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-023#87:1>
The acceptance by the Government of the Society's Master Plan, almost
in its entirety, augurs well for wildlife in Singapore ( ST 1/6/91).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-023#88:1>
The diversion of the proposed Mass Rapid Transit line to preserve the
rich bird haven at Senoko is a positive and committed move in nature
conservation ( ST 20/6/91 ) .

<ICE-SIN:W2A-023#89:1>
However, the proposal by the Public Utilities Board to develop golf
courses at the central catchment areas ( Sunday Times 28/4/91) is a
regression.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-023#90:1>
Animal population levels must be of sufficient numbers to ensure
their survival and permanence.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-023#91:1>
Already numbers have dwindled, and with further encroachment of
forest reserves, the future looks bleak.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-023#92:1>
When the natural habitat is destroyed, a whole ecosystem with its
vast array of life-forms is forever extinguished.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-023#93:1>
It is a tragedy that parts of this supposedly " protected" forest,
much revered through the years, may be bulldozed to meet the increasing
demands for golfing.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-023#94:1>
It would have made more sense to use less important, non-forested
sites.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-023#95:1>
Trees which took decades to grow and develop can be wantonly felled
within minutes.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-023#96:1>
The removal of these trees will reduce the water-holding capacity of
the forest and the resulting rapid run-off of rainwater can cause serious
erosion and flooding.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-023#97:1>
Well-manicured golf links, although green and soothing, support
little wildlife, and chemical fertilizers and insecticides that control pests
on the golf course may drain into and pollute the water catchment areas.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-023#98:1>
Already the access of small, ground-dwelling mammals from the BTNR to
the central water catchment forest areas and vice versa, have been severed by
the expressway which traverses them.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-023#99:1>
Even aboreal creatures are being affected by this development.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-023#100:1>
The Flying Lemur does not actually fly but glides and, without the
benefit of tall intervening trees from which it takes flight off and lands
on, it risks being stranded at vulnerably low levels.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-023#101:1>
Preserving some of the tall trees on either side of the expressway
would have benefited this endangered mammal.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-023#102:1>
In addition to this threat, the Flying Lemur is still being hunted
by poachers for consumption in traditional medicine although its efficacy is
unproven.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-023#103:1>
Indeed, many people have never seen a Flying Lemur as it cannot
survive in captivity.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-023#104:1>
The glimpse in this book may be the only one you will ever see. <X>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-023#X105:1>
The trapping of wildlife, especially mammals, to satisfy jaded but
insatiable appetites must not be condoned.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-023#X106:1>
Some of these mammals are kept as pets and it seems that the more
endangered the species, the more appealing it is to own.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-023#X107:1>
Others fall victim to poachers - - like the large numbers of flying
foxes which were trapped and brutally clubbed to death in the Central
Catchment Area ( The New Paper 6/6/91).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-023#X108:1>
Although the National Parks Act affords protection to the flora and
fauna in some sites, enforcement is difficult as there is insufficient
policing.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-023#X109:1>
Poachers have become bolder, openly defiant and fully aware that
there is little chance of being prosecuted.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-023#X110:1>
This is particularly true of bird poachers.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-023#X111:1>
Ironically, bird appreciation in this region, which takes the form
of bird-singing contests, has encouraged poaching.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-023#X112:1>
Many songbirds are captured from the wild and it is a wonder that
they still sing mellifluously despite being caged.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-023#X113:1>
Some of the popular song birds are the Magpie Robin and the
White-rumped Sharma.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-023#X114:1>
The former was once reported to be the most common bird in
Singapore but now only a few pairs exist in the wild.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-023#X115:1>
The latter has been virtually trapped out of existence.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-023#X116:1>
Although already banned, the use of mist nets for trapping birds
still persists.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-023#X117:1>
In 1991 alone, about 1.4 million birds were imported while 350,000
were exported ( ST 7/10/91).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-023#X118:1>
Moreover, there is an alarmingly high mortality rate within the
trade - a tragic waste.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-023#X119:1>
The lack of suitable nesting sites is another problem faced by the
birdlife of Singapore.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-023#X120:1>
The few existing sites are in relatively inaccessible and
unfrequented areas, but the eggs and nestlings are still vulnerable to
predators, including man.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-023#X121:1>
Also, when more land is cleared for development, the natural
feeding and breeding grounds of the birds becomes increasingly scarce.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-023#X122:1>
This displaces them to inhospitable areas which adversely affects
their propagation, threatening their very existence.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-023#X123:1>
An example is the very colourful Red Junglefowl which is threatened
with extinction by poaching and developments around Pulau Ubin.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-023#X124:1>
Worldwide, birds are squeezed out of areas where they rightfully
belong due to habitat loss - surely supremacy of the vast deserves more
ground support.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-023#X125:1>
Many migrant birds like egrets, bitterns, Common Kingfisher,
Japanese Sparrowhawk, Barn Swallow, Blue-tailed Bee-eater will have less
places to which to migrate.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-023#X126:1>
Last year, the Himalayan Griffon made a rare and brief visit here
to escape the especially cold winter.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-023#X127:1>
The few who saw it were held spellbound by its massive wing span
and majestic flight. </X> </I>
