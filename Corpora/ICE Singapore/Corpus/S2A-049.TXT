<ICE-SIN:S2A-049#1:1:A>
Now I had elected to speak from here uh for the simple reason
that I do not have any transparencies to show

<ICE-SIN:S2A-049#2:1:A>
Now the final exam in N U S is really an institution

<ICE-SIN:S2A-049#3:1:A>
And I think for even those of us who may not have been educated here
we know that as a fact I think uh if not before then by the time you reach uh
this point in the uh seminar series you have known that

<ICE-SIN:S2A-049#4:1:A>
Now the students in the days when the final exam is the only
yardstick by which they are measure

<ICE-SIN:S2A-049#5:1:A>
I think they are caught between two resignations

<ICE-SIN:S2A-049#6:1:A>
Let me explain

<ICE-SIN:S2A-049#7:1:A>
Before the exam their motto seems to be or they are rather resign to
the fact that the sooner you fall behind the longer you have to catch up

<ICE-SIN:S2A-049#8:1:A>
So they operate on that principle and indeed it's a very well uhm uh
established principle

<ICE-SIN:S2A-049#9:1:A>
Because from July anywhere from July until uhm February you have a
lot of time to catch up right if you fall behind soon enough

<ICE-SIN:S2A-049#10:1:A>
And after the exam they are resign to the fact that uh

<ICE-SIN:S2A-049#11:1:A>
And I quote from somewhere education is what's survives when what
has been examined has been forgotten right

<ICE-SIN:S2A-049#12:1:A>
Because then it's too late to do anything anyway so might as well
uh resign yourself to that

<ICE-SIN:S2A-049#13:1:A>
Now this uh very strange phenomena of placing the final exam as the
focal point of the year

<ICE-SIN:S2A-049#14:1:A>
And in some sense the whole uh three or four years that N U S
student have uh to spend uh at this campus uh produce a really uh unique set
of problems for people on both sides of the examination

<ICE-SIN:S2A-049#15:1:A>
Now I speak not as an educationist and and really I do not have uh
very profound thoughts on the subject

<ICE-SIN:S2A-049#16:1:A>
But I speak as a person who has come through the system uh mostly
on the side of the staff

<ICE-SIN:S2A-049#17:1:A>
Because my my own education is largely not from N U S and uh I hope
to share some of those with you now

<ICE-SIN:S2A-049#18:1:A>
Now after have the students have gone through about three of those
final exams or in some cases four

<ICE-SIN:S2A-049#19:1:A>
I'm sure many of them could almost reside the examiner's injunction
from the microphone right it goes something like blah blah blah blah blah
blah

<ICE-SIN:S2A-049#20:1:A>
And and then it ends with something like expulsion from the
university right

<ICE-SIN:S2A-049#21:1:A>
And then after a while I say you may start now

<ICE-SIN:S2A-049#22:1:A>
I think it's something like that right

<ICE-SIN:S2A-049#23:1:A>
That's what I you call anyway and and then they bury their head
right into their examination paper and they keep going

<ICE-SIN:S2A-049#24:1:A>
Now why why why do they sit through that and what are the
justifications for having the exam

<ICE-SIN:S2A-049#25:1:A>
In the group discussion that we had just now to my surprise passion
do run high uh on why we had examinations and not other form of assessment

<ICE-SIN:S2A-049#26:1:A>
Uhm or rather why are no other forms of assessment use more
profitably in our educational process

<ICE-SIN:S2A-049#27:1:A>
And the discussion already <unclear> word </unclear> run to
national objectives how we want to play in the big league and so on to
philosophical issues and the technical terms that come out baffle even me you
know

<ICE-SIN:S2A-049#28:1:A>
Because I'm not one of those that understand all the normatives
summative <unclear> word </unclear> and whatever uh uh procedures that are
going on examination

<ICE-SIN:S2A-049#29:1:A>
But let me say uh in defence of the final exam since uh I have to
that the common denominator principle plays a large part and I I firmly
believe in it

<ICE-SIN:S2A-049#30:1:A>
The idea is that the level the the plain field should be level
because if you allow uhm the staff members to do their own assessment then we
know all the problems that can come out of it

<ICE-SIN:S2A-049#31:1:A>
I mean I come from the Business Administration Faculty and we do
have some continuous assessment components and I must confess that they are
some irregularities that uh would not be so prominent in the final

<ICE-SIN:S2A-049#32:1:A>
Let me just quote a few

<ICE-SIN:S2A-049#33:1:A>
When you have quizzes that are set and not at the same time and on
the same place uh you are bound to have some problems with uhm the standards
being different because you know N U S students are so well-informed

<ICE-SIN:S2A-049#34:1:A>
They operate in a in a a market of perfect information coming from
my faculty

<ICE-SIN:S2A-049#35:1:A>
If you give an exam at two o'clock you cannot repeat the same exam
at four o'clock you know

<ICE-SIN:S2A-049#36:1:A>
Otherwise they you know you most of the students will get one
hundred per cent

<ICE-SIN:S2A-049#37:1:A>
So because of that you have real problems and then of course you
know in the final exam when you grade questions when you are going through
the scripts you do not know who are answering the questions unless they use
special kind of colour ink or something to signal to you

<ICE-SIN:S2A-049#38:1:A>
But that is usually not the case for continuous assessment you do
know except perhaps you make them quizzes uh you do know the and and uh
students are not very happy about that

<ICE-SIN:S2A-049#39:1:A>
Yes you can imagine

<ICE-SIN:S2A-049#40:1:A>
And of course uhm if you conduct quizzes as we do during tutorial
groups they are actually very distinct possibility of student cheating

<ICE-SIN:S2A-049#41:1:A>
Sometimes you could almost tell that they are cheating it's just
that you couldn't put quite your finger on it

<ICE-SIN:S2A-049#42:1:A>
Because you know if they are not really caught red-handed really
that's the problem

<ICE-SIN:S2A-049#43:1:A>
And in the final exam much of this is eliminated because everybody
sits on a a presumably identical uh chair and they during that three hours
perform and then they walk out and everybody can can see that it's quite fair

<ICE-SIN:S2A-049#44:1:A>
Or is it quite fair

<ICE-SIN:S2A-049#45:1:A>
Now let me just mention then in the next few minutes some of the
problems that are real and not so much theoretical

<ICE-SIN:S2A-049#46:1:A>
First of all we assume the examiner care about setting a good exam
or even a fair exam

<ICE-SIN:S2A-049#47:1:A>
Uh what do you mean by good

<ICE-SIN:S2A-049#48:1:A>
Well we have some exposition on that issue uh during uh Doctor
Pang's uh session and also actually in our group discussion

<ICE-SIN:S2A-049#49:1:A>
We have to clarify for student the content expectation right

<ICE-SIN:S2A-049#50:1:A>
I mean even that sometimes is not done very well uh from my
personal experience

<ICE-SIN:S2A-049#51:1:A>
And the fact that the final exam is actually conducted after the
various uhm significant student evaluation process

<ICE-SIN:S2A-049#52:1:A>
By that is the time and we are evaluated by students right

<ICE-SIN:S2A-049#53:1:A>
The fact that the final exam is after that actually have some
bearing on the way it's conducted

<ICE-SIN:S2A-049#54:1:A>
I mean this again I speak from personal experience because somehow
or other is like they they don't have a they don't have the final say you
have the final say right

<ICE-SIN:S2A-049#55:1:A>
Okay that's one point

<ICE-SIN:S2A-049#56:1:A>
Secondly there is always the charge that uh it's not a good idea to
put all the eggs in one basket and we we know all the problem with that

<ICE-SIN:S2A-049#57:1:A>
And thirdly there is uh the mechanics of how the exam is uhm
conducted

<ICE-SIN:S2A-049#58:1:A>
Now we talk about a level playing field but you know some student
happen to sit below the air-conditioner

<ICE-SIN:S2A-049#59:1:A>
And you you know I have one student who actually was near freezing
this time and and you know she said that you know I was feeling so cold so I
searched around

<ICE-SIN:S2A-049#60:1:A>
In the end I just switched off that particular air-conditioner for
her okay

<ICE-SIN:S2A-049#61:1:A>
Now if she didn't do well she has a good reason not to do well
right

<ICE-SIN:S2A-049#62:1:A>
And you know that students that are nearer the entrance actually
might get anything up to one minute more to read the examination

<ICE-SIN:S2A-049#63:1:A>
You all know that because it takes a long time to walk from one end
of World Trade Centre to the other end

<ICE-SIN:S2A-049#64:1:A>
And when collecting the papers and this is something that I raised
with the Registrar's Office actually uh once when I was a young energetic
lecturer

<ICE-SIN:S2A-049#65:1:A>
That the the students uh many students do not honour the rule of
put down your pen or stop writing now whatever the the instructor said

<ICE-SIN:S2A-049#66:1:A>
And they keep writing because they know that nobody get penalised
for it

<ICE-SIN:S2A-049#67:1:A>
They get the a a back look I mean from the person collecting that's
about it

<ICE-SIN:S2A-049#68:1:A>
And I I feel that things can be done about it but but this is a
real problem

<ICE-SIN:S2A-049#69:1:A>
And thirdly with technology so advance today or rather lastly you
have problem with calculators

<ICE-SIN:S2A-049#70:1:A>
Now the typical Registrar Office personnel or the typical
invigilator cannot tell the difference between a calculator with only four
functions and one that has one megabite of memory

<ICE-SIN:S2A-049#71:1:A>
And at the level where I'm teaching it makes a lot of difference
let me tell you that

<ICE-SIN:S2A-049#72:1:A>
And then there is the grading system

<ICE-SIN:S2A-049#73:1:A>
Now we know uh that the examiner is under very great pressure to
finish all the scripts right

<ICE-SIN:S2A-049#74:1:A>
And uh at one time we have got six hundred and sixty student taking
Statistics in second year

<ICE-SIN:S2A-049#75:1:A>
And to finish that in a short time is a not a easy thing to do

<ICE-SIN:S2A-049#76:1:A>
And so all the concomitant problems about consistency and all that
all comes in

<ICE-SIN:S2A-049#77:1:A>
And these are real problems too ah

<ICE-SIN:S2A-049#78:1:A>
Uhm and then marks recordings can uh contain mistake in that

<ICE-SIN:S2A-049#79:1:A>
We've seen those happening and then uh the grade adjustment is not
consistent

<ICE-SIN:S2A-049#80:1:A>
I mean there is a case uh of uhm a course having about twenty-five

<ICE-SIN:S2A-049#81:1:A>
As in one year and the following year has over two hundred As
because of some <unclear> word </unclear>

<ICE-SIN:S2A-049#82:1:A>
So let me uh then come to the last point then

<ICE-SIN:S2A-049#83:1:A>
Really the problem one of the main problem of examination as uh it
is conducted in this university for for the final exam is that student have
really no way of uh having any feedback from the final exam

<ICE-SIN:S2A-049#84:1:A>
The feedback is really only one way

<ICE-SIN:S2A-049#85:1:A>
So we talk about trying to make the examination a learning process

<ICE-SIN:S2A-049#86:1:A>
I mean in theory it's a a good thing to be able to aim for but for
many students really it's the bottleneck they all have to go through

<ICE-SIN:S2A-049#87:1:A>
Now what can be done to solve some of these problem

<ICE-SIN:S2A-049#88:1:A>
Now that would of course take another half-an-hour but I won't uh I
would spare you that

<ICE-SIN:S2A-049#89:1:A>
I think one possibility is to make it a practice a for at least for
the subjects uh which are are what is term objective for the examiner to pose
some kind of sketches how things should be solved immediately after the exam
on the notice board

<ICE-SIN:S2A-049#90:1:A>
Because I I feel that the learning uh process is incomplete ha if a
person went through three hours trying to solve some problems and they're
never told what the answer was

<ICE-SIN:S2A-049#91:1:A>
Of course for certain things you can't I mean trying to comment on
some Shakespeare sonnets for instance

<ICE-SIN:S2A-049#92:1:A>
I mean there is no model answer to that I could well understand

<ICE-SIN:S2A-049#93:1:A>
But certain things the answers are clear and we must give the
student a chance to look at what they are now before they forget it before
they can say

<ICE-SIN:S2A-049#94:1:A>
And I quote again educationist what survives when what has been
examined has been forgotten

<ICE-SIN:S2A-049#95:1:A>
We don't want them to say that all the time do we

<ICE-SIN:S2A-049#96:1:A>
Thank you

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-049#97:1:B>
Well as you know my assignment is continuous assessment

<ICE-SIN:S2A-049#98:1:B>
I would not have any big uh statement to make or big theorem or
theory to advance

<ICE-SIN:S2A-049#99:1:B>
Uh what I want to talk about will be some problems uh connected
with my own personal experience

<ICE-SIN:S2A-049#100:1:B>
And for that purpose I think it'll be useful if I give if I say a
few words about where which department I come from and so on a bit about the
department

<ICE-SIN:S2A-049#101:1:B>
I'm from the Department of Mathematics

<ICE-SIN:S2A-049#102:1:B>
This department is a very big one with something like hundred and
five staff members and we teach about four hundred sorry four thousand two
hundred undergraduate students every year <X>

<ICE-SIN:S2A-049#X103:1:B>
Some of our courses are huge more than six hundred students and
our tutorial groups may be as big as twenty-five students involving perhaps
as many as eight tutors covering forty-two tutorial groups or for the same
course </X> </I>
