<I>

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-034#1:1:A>
I think I agree with Dr Thurow that uhm entrepreneurship isn't
is to a certain degree I think irrelevant to discussion of the Singapore
economy

<ICE-SIN:S1B-034#2:1:A>
Uhm I think what we need really is not so much more talk about
entrepreneurship per se

<ICE-SIN:S1B-034#3:1:A>
I don't think you can actually legislate entrepreneurship

<ICE-SIN:S1B-034#4:1:A>
You can't uh bring it about with more management programmes

<ICE-SIN:S1B-034#5:1:A>
Uh I think what we need more is to talk about whether in the next
lap we will have the kind of creativity the crine of kind of independent
thinking that uh the whole population needs to achieve

<ICE-SIN:S1B-034#6:1:A>
If we are going to achieve the next lap and if that is the case I
think entrepreneurs will will come out and uh the MNCs will also benefit
better so I'm not too sure whether by focussing on whether entrepreneurship
is dead or alive

<ICE-SIN:S1B-034#7:1:A>
We are really focussing on whether the economy is going to do better
or not <X>

<ICE-SIN:S1B-034#X8:1:A>
Martin </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-034#9:1:A>
Well I think we need more creative thinking in the next lap

<ICE-SIN:S1B-034#10:1:A>
Whether the creative thinkers are going to be entrepreneurs or
working in MNCs I think we need more of that in the next lap because in the
next lap with more emphasis on brain services

<ICE-SIN:S1B-034#11:1:A>
If the type of people we're going to have in Singapore are are not
going to be more creative in their thinking then they're not even going to do
well in MNCs <X>

<ICE-SIN:S1B-034#X12:1:A>
Martin </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-034#13:1:B>
Well uhm yes I think Singapore do need entrepreneurs

<ICE-SIN:S1B-034#14:1:B>
And uhm if you want to be an entrepreneur you ask yourself or let's
say you have an idea and you say well I decide that uh I don't want to work
for MNCs anymore and that I want to be my own boss

<ICE-SIN:S1B-034#15:1:B>
Uh is that the only reason you want to be an entrepreneur ask
yourself

<ICE-SIN:S1B-034#16:1:B>
Uhm if the reason is that uh perhaps you want to uhm have greater
freedom okay as some people do or perhaps you want to see the result of your
own achievement in terms of seeing the growth of the company that you set up
or you would want to uhm have recognition uhm there are number of reasons or
perhaps you want to be very rich one of these days okay <X>

<ICE-SIN:S1B-034#X17:1:B>
Martin </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-034#18:1:B>
Well if you become an entrepreneur or try to become an
entrepreneur because it's glamourous or because everybody else seems to be
doing it I think that's the reason to be to be one

<ICE-SIN:S1B-034#19:1:B>
Uhm perhaps you are not so focussed

<ICE-SIN:S1B-034#20:1:B>
That's that's quite important to be quite focussed in what you want
to do <X>

<ICE-SIN:S1B-034#X21:1:B>
Martin </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-034#22:1:A>
Yah I think you have state entrepreneurship already existing
very much in Singapore <X>

<ICE-SIN:S1B-034#X23:1:A>
Martin </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-034#24:1:A>
What if you have to ask yourself whether you are needed in
considering whether you you want to be an entrepreneur or not than I think
you shouldn't be an entrepreneur to begin with <X>

<ICE-SIN:S1B-034#X25:1:A>
Martin </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-034#26:1:A>
I think there's room for you in the domestic economy

<ICE-SIN:S1B-034#27:1:A>
I think Singapore is a tracheotomized economy you've got the MNC
sector you've got the large uh government link companies and the large public
listed companies and then you have a rather small domestic sector

<ICE-SIN:S1B-034#28:1:A>
I think there's quite a lot of room for entrepreneurship within the
domestic sector

<ICE-SIN:S1B-034#29:1:A>
As to whether you can make that jump from being a small time
essentially city oriented economy as Dr Thurow said

<ICE-SIN:S1B-034#30:1:A>
Whether you can make that leap to becoming even more national
regional entrepreneur I think that is a very good question to ask <X>

<ICE-SIN:S1B-034#X31:1:A>
Martin Dr Thurow Martin Dr Thurow Martin </X>

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-034#32:1:C>
Well my view is that uh the government's stand on the role of
the entrepreneur or entrepreneurship in Singapore is not explicit and if you
look for the clues the clues are there in terms of where they gonna be
allocating resources in the next lap you know with regard to uh Singapore's
economy

<ICE-SIN:S1B-034#33:1:C>
But unless the stay is made more explicit it is very difficult for
the other tier in the economy to response ie the institutions uh aided
professional bodies the organisation and so forth <X>

<ICE-SIN:S1B-034#X34:1:C>
Martin </X> <X>

<ICE-SIN:S1B-034#X35:1:C>
Dr Thurow </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-034#36:1:A>
If I could add to that I think I think uhm in the problem of
entrepreneurship really is like when you mention failure it's like dealing
with the problem impotence

<ICE-SIN:S1B-034#37:1:A>
It's dealing with the problem of failure in that sense and it's
also problem of attitude

<ICE-SIN:S1B-034#38:1:A>
You've got to be more relaxed about your failure

<ICE-SIN:S1B-034#39:1:A>
You've got to be more relaxed about the overall environment the
social culture environment the educational environment the regulatory
environment

<ICE-SIN:S1B-034#40:1:A>
Well it's very uh it's very odd to be on one hand very anxious
about failure and be very anxious about and very uptight about uh whether
we've promoting entrepreneurship enough or not

<ICE-SIN:S1B-034#41:1:A>
And exatly like dealing with impotence you just got to be more
relaxed as a society as a whole relaxed about failure relaxed about many
other things that we have including regulations

<ICE-SIN:S1B-034#42:1:A>
And when that kind of attitudinal environment exist then I think
entrepreneurship will arise on its own accord

<ICE-SIN:S1B-034#43:1:A>
I don't think you can structure it and and mandate and and order it
to come about <X>

<ICE-SIN:S1B-034#X44:1:A>
Martin </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-034#45:1:B>
Well I think a lot depends on the individual alright

<ICE-SIN:S1B-034#46:1:B>
If you are strong enough alright and uh that your inclination and
your ambition is that you want to make it and that you take that important
step and all you see is that you want to make it and the very thought of
failure should be right at the back of your the far end at the back of your
mind

<ICE-SIN:S1B-034#47:1:B>
Okay take that plunge

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-034#48:1:C>
Here I would agree with uh with Rachel totally

<ICE-SIN:S1B-034#49:1:C>
I I think in the Singapore context this is gonna be very difficult
to change the environment in terms you know the low tolerance for failures

<ICE-SIN:S1B-034#50:1:C>
At the end of the day it has got to be with you the entrepreneur
<X>

<ICE-SIN:S1B-034#X51:1:C>
Martin </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-034#52:1:A>
Now I I would disagree I would disagree with that view totally

<ICE-SIN:S1B-034#53:1:A>
I think we should not take it as a given that Singapore society is
going to have this high level of intolerance for failure we should take it as
a given and therefore we just praise uhm and try to nurture those
entrepreneurs who have made it

<ICE-SIN:S1B-034#54:1:A>
I think history has shown that a lot of entrepreneurs will finally
become successful were not successful initially

<ICE-SIN:S1B-034#55:1:A>
And I think the the the the crux of the problem really is with the
educational system uhm an educational system which on one hand I think we
should certainly we should certainly promote meritocracy we should give a lot
of attention to achievement orientation but there should not be that
collorary stigma attached to failure

<ICE-SIN:S1B-034#56:1:A>
I think in educational system today we have a lot of young people
who at a very age already think they're washed out and they're failures

<ICE-SIN:S1B-034#57:1:A>
Luckily I think educational system is changing today so that those
people who are not like to <unclear> word </unclear> that much uh to do that
well in in grades and academically now probably can find other areas where
entrepreneurial flair can be developed

<ICE-SIN:S1B-034#58:1:A>
They can go to fashion school

<ICE-SIN:S1B-034#59:1:A>
They can do a lot of other things which previously they could not
do

<ICE-SIN:S1B-034#60:1:A>
But you know I think a lot of it starts from young

<ICE-SIN:S1B-034#61:1:A>
If you're going to be risk averse when you're young if you are
scared to try things because you think if you fail your peers are going to
look down upon you uh society is going to look down upon you and that happens
to you when you're a teenage what are you going to be like at the age of
thirty

<ICE-SIN:S1B-034#62:1:A>
There will be very few Rachel Swees around <X>

<ICE-SIN:S1B-034#X63:1:A>
Martin Dr Thurow Martin </X>

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-034#64:1:C>
Well I guess uh you have to do a number of things you know

<ICE-SIN:S1B-034#65:1:C>
First is you got to sit down and think through it

<ICE-SIN:S1B-034#66:1:C>
And uh I would advise uh you to think about uh where you are right
now and give due consideration to the best case worst case scenario and uh
you know if it makes sense to you uh after due delineation have been
exercised push on with it <X>

<ICE-SIN:S1B-034#X67:1:C>
Martin </X>

<ICE-SIN:S1B-034#68:1:C>
Well I'm talking about okay thinking about things like you know how
are you going to market it

<ICE-SIN:S1B-034#69:1:C>
I'm thinking about uh you know who who will who will buy your you
know your new uh product <X>

<ICE-SIN:S1B-034#X70:1:C>
Martin </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-034#71:1:A>
Crazy absolutely crazy <X>

<ICE-SIN:S1B-034#X72:1:A>
Martin </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-034#73:1:A>
Well maybe if you were a PhD in Zoology first okay and genetic
engineering and everything else maybe I would say okay

<ICE-SIN:S1B-034#74:1:A>
I'll take a little look at it but I would say I'll be a little bit
doubtful that you could hybridise the chicken and the duck anyway <X>

<ICE-SIN:S1B-034#X75:1:A>
Martin </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-034#76:1:A>
Good good for you <X>

<ICE-SIN:S1B-034#X77:1:A>
Martin </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-034#78:1:A>
It'll help a little bit <X>

<ICE-SIN:S1B-034#X79:1:A>
Martin </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-034#80:1:B>
Have you done a survey of the market as to whether people
would want to consume products like that

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-034#81:1:A>
That's right

<ICE-SIN:S1B-034#82:1:A>
Who likes eating chucks you know what I call due <unclear> word
</unclear> <X>

<ICE-SIN:S1B-034#X83:1:A>
Martin </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-034#84:1:B>
Alright What are the potential what are the potential market

<ICE-SIN:S1B-034#85:1:B>
I mean who are your target audience so to speak and uhm what kind
of return do you expect of it <X>

<ICE-SIN:S1B-034#X86:1:B>
Martin Dr Thurow Martin </X>

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-034#87:1:C>
You need resources <X>

<ICE-SIN:S1B-034#X88:1:C>
Martin </X>

<ICE-SIN:S1B-034#89:1:C>
I think there are a lot of them <X>

<ICE-SIN:S1B-034#X90:1:C>
Martin </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-034#91:1:A>
I think there's a difference

<ICE-SIN:S1B-034#92:1:A>
I think that the example you took of entrepreneurship highlights I
think a misconception of what successful and unsuccessful entrepreneurship
could be

<ICE-SIN:S1B-034#93:1:A>
I think that for every one chuck inventor like you there are
probably ten thousand other people who have think they have designed a better
mouse-trap a better hair-styling lotion or whatever

<ICE-SIN:S1B-034#94:1:A>
These are the the product entrepreneurs that thinkers and the
inventors

<ICE-SIN:S1B-034#95:1:A>
I think the ratio of success for these people actually is very very
small

<ICE-SIN:S1B-034#96:1:A>
But the other kind of entrepreneur which is likely to be able to
succeed I think a bit better is probably the more practical kind perhaps
people who work in an MNC an not one person three four people from an MNC
come out of MNC and then provide an <unclear> word </unclear> already
existing type of service or product probably at a cheaper price with an
improvement

<ICE-SIN:S1B-034#97:1:A>
So you don't have that uh that sort the rather more romantic idea
of the entrepreneur the Thomas Addison who invents the lightbulb I think
that's really too romanticised

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-034#98:1:C>
What I would call organisation sponsered <X>

<ICE-SIN:S1B-034#X99:1:C>
Martin </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-034#100:1:A>
Uhm I think you should go to your uncle your grandfather
every other rich relative you have because seriously if you got a chuck idea
uh especially that has got to do animals which is another big problem
altogether because you're dealing with a lot of other intangibles and even
creating a computer

<ICE-SIN:S1B-034#101:1:A>
Uhm I don't think any venture <unclear> word </unclear> is really
going to finance you so hope you have a rich uncle and or marry somebody very
rich

<ICE-SIN:S1B-034#102:1:A>
That's the only way you're going to get your money <X>

<ICE-SIN:S1B-034#X103:1:A>
Martin Dr Thurow Martin </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-034#104:1:A>
But I think there is a very fundamental quantitative
difference between this chuck and Ben and Jerry's ice-cream because the Ben
and Jerry ice-cream is an incremental innovation

<ICE-SIN:S1B-034#105:1:A>
It's providing a product that's already very well-known with
manufacturing processes that are also very well-known

<ICE-SIN:S1B-034#106:1:A>
It's creating a market niche for itself within an already very
large market the US ice-cream market and it's creating a different kind of
product

<ICE-SIN:S1B-034#107:1:A>
So in in that sense if you didn't create a chuck if you found a
new way of making Hainanese chicken rice that was better quality uh then I
may be willing to finance you but my concern is that this chuck is quite
different from Ben and Jerry's ice-cream

<ICE-SIN:S1B-034#108:1:A>
It's a totally new product that has never been tried out before
<X>

<ICE-SIN:S1B-034#X109:1:A>
Martin Dr Thurow </X>

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-034#110:1:C>
I think there're two ways

<ICE-SIN:S1B-034#111:1:C>
One would be to look for venture capital funds that are purely
venture capital funds <X>

<ICE-SIN:S1B-034#X112:1:C>
Now the one problem with that is that many of these funds have
very high uh hundle criteria for return on investments and they also have a
short pay back period They've got to be able to cash out of your investment
within five years or so So there's a lot of stress on you if you get a pure
venture capital fund On the other hand you've also got very large companies
insurance companies some of the GLCs operating enterprises that have got
investment arms and I think these investments arms are in many ways better
partners Uh on one hand they bring to you not just money nor just
professional expertise in terms of pretty professional expertise but they
also bring to you a lot of connections that they may have in their own
operating ventures Uh and in this respect I think one should consider not
just getting money from banks nor just pure venture capital funds but finding
an actual operating partner to go into business with you </X> </I>
