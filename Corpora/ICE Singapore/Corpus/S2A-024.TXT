<ICE-SIN:S2A-024#1:1:A>
Now good afternoon to all of you President of the Arts Club and
Arts Club committee members colleagues the Deanery and freshmen and friends

<ICE-SIN:S2A-024#2:1:A>
Well I should very fresh people because we mustn't be too gender you
know specific

<ICE-SIN:S2A-024#3:1:A>
Well you have come really to the largest faculty of course the the
President of the Arts Club has said that that the faculty is second to none
but we can claim to be certainly the largest faculty on this campus with
something like four thousand four hundred students uh three hundred and forty
academic staff another ninety to hundred uh non-academic staff

<ICE-SIN:S2A-024#4:1:A>
So we really are a very large faculty certainly the largest in terms
of students

<ICE-SIN:S2A-024#5:1:A>
And student welfare student education training is our business

<ICE-SIN:S2A-024#6:1:A>
So we are again welcoming you to this uh Faculty of the University

<ICE-SIN:S2A-024#7:1:A>
I know that uh you've been exposed to a number of welcomes already
but never mind this is the month of of when you're just uh coming in and
you're most welcome

<ICE-SIN:S2A-024#8:1:A>
Now I'll like to just also say that the Deanery reflects the Faculty
as a whole

<ICE-SIN:S2A-024#9:1:A>
Even among my colleagues I'm from the History Department the
Vice-Deans are from Geography and Political Science the Sub-Deans from
Economics and Statistics and from Social Work and Psychology

<ICE-SIN:S2A-024#10:1:A>
So we represent already five departments and several subjects
because you can see that some of the departments are double-barrel
departments with a couple of subjects

<ICE-SIN:S2A-024#11:1:A>
Now we have act actually eleven departments now we have twelve but
Mass Com became a programme

<ICE-SIN:S2A-024#12:1:A>
The Department of Mass Com was transferred to the second university

<ICE-SIN:S2A-024#13:1:A>
But we continue with the Mass Communication Programme in this
faculty

<ICE-SIN:S2A-024#14:1:A>
So we've got eleven departments and we've got four Faculty
Programmes together with a new programme being offered by the Department of
English Language and Literature namely Theatre Studies

<ICE-SIN:S2A-024#15:1:A>
So things are happening

<ICE-SIN:S2A-024#16:1:A>
We have not just a large faculty but a faculty which comes with a
lot of intellectual activity a lot of interesting activity

<ICE-SIN:S2A-024#17:1:A>
Now we're an arts faculty so remember this we want to cultivate not
simply uh personality but really the artistic sides of your personality

<ICE-SIN:S2A-024#18:1:A>
And this is something we want to develop not just giving
information but to encourage the imagination

<ICE-SIN:S2A-024#19:1:A>
This is what art is about

<ICE-SIN:S2A-024#20:1:A>
But more than that we are also a faculty of arts and social
sciences

<ICE-SIN:S2A-024#21:1:A>
So there's that element of really seeking to be a bit more
scientific about things

<ICE-SIN:S2A-024#22:1:A>
Although it's social science there's that element in it trying to
uh be more precise to use more quantitative methods and not just using
imagination

<ICE-SIN:S2A-024#23:1:A>
So we want to anchor it in more specific uh inquiries

<ICE-SIN:S2A-024#24:1:A>
Uh this is not to say that the humanities are you know rather
free-floating and the science the social sciences are rather hard

<ICE-SIN:S2A-024#25:1:A>
No there's a blend of it but in your first year you're doing three
subjects

<ICE-SIN:S2A-024#26:1:A>
So you have a chance to uh combine arts and social sciences if you
wish and not only also uh this kind of combination but remember combine
combining certain subjects with programmes which are multi-disciplinary

<ICE-SIN:S2A-024#27:1:A>
I'm talking about European Studies South-East Asian Studies
Linguistics which are supposed to be multi- and even inter-disciplinary

<ICE-SIN:S2A-024#28:1:A>
And in the case of the Studies Programmes and the Studies
Departments remember that also that element of language which you are able to
pick up

<ICE-SIN:S2A-024#29:1:A>
So we are really very proud and very happy that we have an
opportunity opportunity to offer you such a variety of riches uh in terms of
intellectual activity and stimuli

<ICE-SIN:S2A-024#30:1:A>
Now of course you'll be very uh still finding your feet I mean
subjects actually but be assured that most students are able to get some of
their top choices

<ICE-SIN:S2A-024#31:1:A>
Most of them most of you so be encouraged

<ICE-SIN:S2A-024#32:1:A>
However if you do have difficulties do try to be a bit uh
adventurous a bit more adaptable and be prepared to make a few little changes
uh in your thinking so that you can uh maybe pick up something which is new

<ICE-SIN:S2A-024#33:1:A>
And from our little research we found that don't worry those who
even were given you know subjects which didn't really feature in their first
three choices managed to do well enough

<ICE-SIN:S2A-024#34:1:A>
And very few of those who have to do supplementaries and fail
really were those who you know just couldn't cope with the subjects they're
given

<ICE-SIN:S2A-024#35:1:A>
So there's no real correlation uh between those who had their first
choices and doing extremely well in them or those who did not get their
choices and doing badly in them so be encouraged

<ICE-SIN:S2A-024#36:1:A>
But if you have problems we have uh the department uh to give
advice as well as members of the Deanery especially the Vice-Dean Dr Lee Boon
Hiok and also our our our Faculty Associate Mrs Ann Wee

<ICE-SIN:S2A-024#37:1:A>
They're here to really advise you to help you

<ICE-SIN:S2A-024#38:1:A>
I always say that the Vice-Dean is not a terrible person unlike the
dedication <unclear> word </unclear> / designation <unclear> word </unclear>
/ delegation <unclear> word </unclear> 'Vice-Dean' you know who's out to to
look out for vices and or something like that

<ICE-SIN:S2A-024#39:1:A>
No nothing like that

<ICE-SIN:S2A-024#40:1:A>
The Vice-Dean is and and the Vice-Deans in fact are both
Ad-Vice-Deans

<ICE-SIN:S2A-024#41:1:A>
They give good advice uh on certain matters and both of them are
very intimately involved in helping student matters in in student matters

<ICE-SIN:S2A-024#42:1:A>
Not not just one

<ICE-SIN:S2A-024#43:1:A>
Professor Lee Boon Hiok give uh more you know advice about course
enrolments and combinations and so on but uh Dr Victor Savage is our Liaison
with the Arts Club and Societies and he tells me to give a little bit of
encouragement to you all

<ICE-SIN:S2A-024#44:1:A>
Of course you are practially ipso facto members of the Arts Club
but be encouraged also to join uh some societies uh the ones which you feel
can be of most help uh to you

<ICE-SIN:S2A-024#45:1:A>
But also be a bit adventurous

<ICE-SIN:S2A-024#46:1:A>
Join other societies even if you're not reading a particular
subject

<ICE-SIN:S2A-024#47:1:A>
So you get a wider exposure to the range with we offer in our
faculty

<ICE-SIN:S2A-024#48:1:A>
Well these are just some words of encouragement at this stage
because you will hear a lot of things being said a lot of information that
you might even get uh intellectual con constipation of some sort

<ICE-SIN:S2A-024#49:1:A>
Terrible you know just can't digest all these things

<ICE-SIN:S2A-024#50:1:A>
But try to take stock try to pause at times reflect and don't let
uh it become systems-overload and all the alarm bells start ringing

<ICE-SIN:S2A-024#51:1:A>
Don't worry just try to uh pause at times take stock of what uh is
being offered

<ICE-SIN:S2A-024#52:1:A>
Don't just consult seniors but also attend lectures for yourselves
to see what the courses are about before you try to make your choices such
choices as you have

<ICE-SIN:S2A-024#53:1:A>
But nonetheless be encouraged at this time

<ICE-SIN:S2A-024#54:1:A>
Don't be you know despondent because there're always people who are
around who can help you

<ICE-SIN:S2A-024#55:1:A>
Well on that note I again warmly welcome you to the faculty on
behalf of my colleagues and I wish you every success in your time with us

<ICE-SIN:S2A-024#56:1:A>
Thank you </I>

We also have quite a number of special guests in the audience but I
I'm afraid I can't introduce all of them

<ICE-SIN:S2A-024#77:2:B>
There's so many of them but certainly they're very important people
in the administration whom you should also meet during the tea

<ICE-SIN:S2A-024#78:2:B>
We're very happy that they are represented here

<ICE-SIN:S2A-024#79:2:B>
Now I'll like to just say a short word of this tea and why we've
organized it

<ICE-SIN:S2A-024#80:2:B>
Well this is intended of course mainly for newcomers although
sometimes we have gatecrashers from the other years because they've they've
come to know what the tea is about

<ICE-SIN:S2A-024#81:2:B>
It's a welcome tea especially for freshers but we also welcome old
friends and we also have invited first year lecturers and visiting professors
to join us

<ICE-SIN:S2A-024#82:2:B>
So you see some people who are <unclear> word </unclear> here only
for one year as well as those who teach the first years uh meeting us in this
tea

<ICE-SIN:S2A-024#83:2:B>
This is a good meeting point because in Singaporean style it's a
eating point

<ICE-SIN:S2A-024#84:2:B>
Where there're eats there're also meets

<ICE-SIN:S2A-024#85:2:B>
Now we also want to use this opportunity to honour to recognise to
honour our prize winners our students who have well in their studies as well
as society and club people who have helped in student life

<ICE-SIN:S2A-024#86:2:B>
So this is an opportunity to just say Thank you a very big Thank
you to them

<ICE-SIN:S2A-024#87:2:B>
Now in this connection I want to associate myself with the Arts
Club President in congratulating the Club and those who were particularly
involved in the making of the Faculty float which as Lincoln reminded you won
a silver medal in the competition yes yesterday

<ICE-SIN:S2A-024#88:2:B>
So thanks again Arts Club and all the helpers who made the float

<ICE-SIN:S2A-024#89:2:B>
I'll like also uh on this very first occasion when I address all of
you together to mention that we have introduced two new programmes this year

<ICE-SIN:S2A-024#90:2:B>
One is an undergraduate programme and that is the Art the Theatre
Studies Programme which is offered by the Department of English Language and
Literature for the first time and we want to congratulate the department for
doing so and to welcome all those of you who are registered for Theatre
Studies

<ICE-SIN:S2A-024#91:2:B>
And then the second programme is a postgraduate programme and that
is the Masters in Public Policy which is managed by the Centre of Advanced
Studies and under its Director Professor Ong Jin Hui

<ICE-SIN:S2A-024#92:2:B>
This is a again a first for our Faculty and we've very much uh
looked forward to welcoming people from not only Singapore but people from
the ASEAN countries

<ICE-SIN:S2A-024#93:2:B>
They've come to join us and even beyond from Mexico

<ICE-SIN:S2A-024#94:2:B>
So we're very happy for the Faculty that we have this programme
running for the first time this this session

<ICE-SIN:S2A-024#95:2:B>
I'd like also to make little comments about Mass Communication

<ICE-SIN:S2A-024#96:2:B>
Again I think that many of you if not most are aware that while
Mass Communication has been transformed from a department to a programme <X>

<ICE-SIN:S2A-024#X97:2:B>
This is because it was felt that uh for the sake of not dividing
resources between the two universities it should should be more or less
centralized in the Nanyang Technological Tech Technological University
Nonetheless we have uh obligation to our students in Mass Communication so
last year and again for this year we've taken in a first year intake for Mass
Communication so it's not not not it's no longer a department it is a very
vibrant programme of the Faculty and uh Director of the Programme Professor
Eddie Kuo is simultaneously Dean of the School of Communication Studies NTU
which will receive it's first intake next year So this is just to explain the
little change but nonetheless we are very much assured the students are
assured that things will go on as usual You will graduate with NUS degrees So
we're very happy that this will not really affect resources being/been given
to the Mass Communication students and staff So I thought this would be
important to explain Now a word to the freshies a special word Now we want
want to congratulate those who have made it because for everyone who has been
accepted into the two universities four or five have been turned away So
those of you who have come in you're very fortunate and we want to warmly
welcome and congratulate you on coming into NUS and to our Faculty We also
would like to say that it's a bit be bewildering to be a member a student in
the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences because there are eleven departments
and four Faculty Programmes one Department Programme and so on and so many
other subjects which have been offered including an import of Mathematics
from the Science Faculty But I'll like to assure you that we have a
embarrassment of riches not of poverty to contend with Now you may not always
have the subjects of your choice but we'll try and give you uh perhaps your
first choice at least of two or three of your choices as far as possible but
at this stage I want to counsel a little bit of flexibility on your part
Please don't be too disappointed if you don't get all the three subjects of
your choice But we'll try our best to accomodate uh you in at least uh your
your top two choices So this is just a word to all of you because in trying
to be fair to some we might be unfair to so many others So I trust you'll
understand our constraints and on your part exercise a little bit of uh
flexibility and adaptability as you come in for the first year But
nonetheless may I in advance wish you every success in your studies and your
ECA uh on this campus Now in conclusion I'll like to thank especially the
Faculty's Social Committee and the Arts Club people who've helped in
organizing this welcome tea and now what else remains We're going to eat soon
but there remains also to give out the prizes and I want to in in advance
congratulate all of the prize winners and those who have contributed to the
Faculty and then after that of course we can all have tea together Thank you
</X> </I>
