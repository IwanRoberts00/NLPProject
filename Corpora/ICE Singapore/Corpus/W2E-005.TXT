<h> <bold> Wealth sharing S'pore-style </bold> </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-005#2:1>
<p> FOR those who believe that massive give-aways are a panacea for the poor,
a sobering reminder is to be found in Finance Minister Richard Hu's keynote
address at an economics conference on income distribution held here last
week.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-005#3:1>
He said Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union which at tempted
total elimination of income inequalities have ended up in economic atrophy
and social disorder.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-005#4:1>
Since all countries could profit from each other's experience in the
complex subject of income distribution, Dr Hu recounted how Singapore
succeeded in tackling the problem by empha sising equality of
opportunity and equity of re ward, rather than equality of income. </p>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-005#5:1>
<p> With little land and other resources, Singapore was constrained from
redistribution via direct progressive taxation or generous subsidies.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-005#6:1>
Also, at the beginning there was little to redistribute as mass
unemployment, crowded and unsanitary housing and low per capita income were
the order of the day.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-005#7:1>
The only thing that the Government could give away was a conducive
framework for job creation.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-005#8:1>
This it did by structuring a pro-business strategy that
attracted investors.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-005#9:1>
The jobs rolled in.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-005#10:1>
Where others sought to tackle inequali ties with hand-outs,
Singapore did with jobs.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-005#11:1>
Equally important in this strategy is the practice of meritocracy
which greatly fostered upward mobility and has bscome a powerful spur to
economic endeavour and new enterprise, underlining that equity of reward
not only effectively redis tributes income but ensures that the momentum
for job creation and, therefore, growth continues. </p>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-005#12:1>
<p> While Singapore's strategy did not provide for consumption subsidies, it
does allow help in asset accumulation.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-005#13:1>
Low-cost housing, provided some times through acquisition of
land from private owners at below market price, enabled a major
redistribution of assets.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-005#14:1>
The scheduled upgrading of HDB housing where the Government will pay
&dollar;2 for every
&dollar;1 put in by the owner will redistribute wealth further.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-005#15:1>
The redistribution does not stop at mortar and bricks.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-005#16:1>
By continuing to invest heavi ly in education, in and outside of
the workplace, everyone is given a chance to accumulate human capital through
the acquisition of new skills.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-005#17:1>
With this " human capital", workers will be better able to negotiate
a more equitable share of an enter prise's income with the providers of
traditional capital.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-005#18:1>
This again redistributes wealth, but not without effort on the part
of those receiving it.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-005#19:1>
But then this is what equity of reward is about.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-005#20:1>
You get equal opportunity to acquire the capital.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-005#21:1>
You invest it.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-005#22:1>
You get rewards commensurate with the value of your capital.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-005#23:1>
The integrity of capital, which makes savings meaningful, has been
maintained by a low inflation regime. </p>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-005#24:1>
<p> Now if Singapore's approach to redressing in equalities is a bit
hard-headed, it nevertheless is not heartless.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-005#25:1>
For although the emphasis remains <quote> from each his contribution
and to each his own reward </quote> , it recognises that there will always be
some - like the aged poor and otherwise under privileged - who will need
help.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-005#26:1>
Economic suc cess may reduce demand for Government-subsi
dised basic health care and education but such facilities will remain easily
available to those in need.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-005#27:1>
However, reflecting the ethos of self-help in the system, the
Government expects private con tributions for the care of the
under-class, just as it expects cost sharing from those who want the
Government to gild the lily by way of art and culture.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-005#28:1>
As First Deputy Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong said at the reopening of
the National Museum last week when the question of Govern ment aid for
museums was raised: the Govern ment's priority would always be to
satisfy the people's material aspirations. </p>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-005#29:1>
<p> This then is Singapore's experience in wealth sharing.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-005#30:1>
The formula may not work for everyone but because it has worked well
for Singapore, there must be something in it of benefit to coun tries
which choose to emulate what has been done here through selective adaptation.
</p> </I>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-005#31:2>
<h> <bold> Poorer without Gatt </bold> </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-005#32:2>
<p> FOR all the dire warnings of the catastrophe that would follow a collapse
of the current trade talks going on in Brussels, it may be assumed that the
world will still go on.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-005#33:2>
As some experts have noted, it is not politicians and governments
that trade but private businesses.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-005#34:2>
And, increasingly, they are making cross-border investments and
forging multilateral co-operative ties that will boost inter national
trade whatever politicians decide.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-005#35:2>
Never theless, governments can make things easier or more
difficult for businesses.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-005#36:2>
And there can be little doubt that it would be a poorer world if this
week's talks, the culmination of four years of intensive negotiations, end in
failure.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-005#37:2>
The benefits of free trade are obvious.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-005#38:2>
The establishment of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (
Gatt) in 1947 and the reductions in tariffs achieved under its auspices have
greatly stimulated world trade and brought prosperity to the countries that
have abided by its rules. </p>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-005#39:2>
<p> The latest round of talks, the most ambitious ever will determine how
nations deal and co-oper ate with each other in a world that is no
longer divided by the Cold War and in which economic strength will
increasingly matter more than guns and missiles.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-005#40:2>
Without new agreement on a clear set of trade rules, the bickering
and threats and counter-threats among the major trading nations in recent
years can only grow worse.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-005#41:2>
Developing countries like Singapore that have been able to grow under
Gatt could flounder without continu ing access to the rich Western
markets.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-005#42:2>
The poor er nations, in particular the debt-ridden Africans and
Latin Americans and the East Europeans now struggling towards a market
economy, stand to suffer most if the talks fail.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-005#43:2>
Without access to Western markets, they cannot hope to succeed and
will only slide further into debt and poverty. </p>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-005#44:2>
<p> The social disorders that must inevitably follow threaten not only them
but the rich nations as well.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-005#45:2>
At the very least, there will be even more people than ever from the
poor countries making their way to the rich lands for jobs and opportunities.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-005#46:2>
As before, the rich countries will no doubt try to ward off the worst
and along the way salve their conscience by providing financial assistance.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-005#47:2>
But the continuing, in some cases worsening, pov erty among many
aid recipients shows the limita tions of handouts.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-005#48:2>
Generosity in admitting their exports works far better.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-005#49:2>
According to a recent World Bank study, developing countries would
gain twice as much as they receive in foreign aid if the rich nations would
remove their barriers on agriculture alone.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-005#50:2>
Consumers in the rich nations would benefit greatly too.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-005#51:2>
According to OECD estimates, it is costing them some US&dollar;147 billion a
year to protect their relatively few but well-off farmers against imports.
</p>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-005#52:2>
<p> Rationally then, all arguments are in favour of freer trade in
agriculture.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-005#53:2>
Ironically, however, it is disagreement on this very issue that
threatens the whole liberalisation package.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-005#54:2>
The United States and its allies in the so-called Cairns group of
farm exporters, which include four Asean na tions, have warned that they
will walk away from the talks unless the European Community agrees to deep
cuts in its agricultural price supports, subsidies and market barriers.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-005#55:2>
There is disagree ment too on a multitude of other issues,
including the extension of Gatt rules to cover the fast-growing trade
in services, two-fifths of which happens to be accounted for by the EC.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-005#56:2>
Here, it is the US, which demanded the extension in the first place,
which is acting as villain.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-005#57:2>
It now wants to exclude certain key sectors such as aviation,
shipping and telecommunications from Gatt rules.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-005#58:2>
The EC, not surprisingly, has hit out at the Americans for this, but
the blame game does no one any good.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-005#59:2>
With out major concessions by all the key parties, and very
quickly too, there will not merely be no new trade order to look forward to.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-005#60:2>
There may be no order at all; and the result could be trade dis
putes that would make today's squabbling look like a tea party. </p> </I>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-005#61:3>
<h> <bold> When wealth gets in the way </bold> </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-005#62:3>
<p> A REFRIGERATOR, a washing machine and a video cassette recorder.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-005#63:3>
Do these add up to being comfortably off?

<ICE-SIN:W2E-005#64:3>
If so, it appears that the majori ty of Singaporeans have indeed
arrived.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-005#65:3>
Accord ing to figures released by Deputy Prime Minister Lee
Hsien Loong in Parliament on Monday, more than 70 per cent of Singapore
households possess these consumer durables, owned by less than half of
households 20 years ago.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-005#66:3>
He gave other figures too, all of them indicative of the dramatic
prog ress that Singaporeans in all income groups have made.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-005#67:3>
Together, they are an effective counter point to remarks made
during a recent seminar by university don Tan Kong Yam that an impor
tant segment of the population, the 20 per cent or so who may be
characterised as the upper-middle class, is caught in a " middle class
squeeze". </p>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-005#68:3>
<p> Dr Tan, vice-dean of the business administra tion faculty of the
National University of Singa pore, maintained that the top 10 per cent
of in come earners had no grouses as their incomes were pegged to
developed country rates and could afford anything they wanted.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-005#69:3>
The lower 70 per cent were content to enjoy the benefits of heavy
government subsidies, in housing, health care and public transport.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-005#70:3>
A happy political alliance be tween the " HDB heartland" class
and the 10 percent elite ensured that the durability of this sys tem
continues, Dr Tan surmised.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-005#71:3>
But, he went on, there was also the upper middle class who were not
so happy: They aspired to something more than public housing and public
transport but were thwarted from attaining this by the superior pur
chasing power of the top 10 per cent.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-005#72:3>
It was these people who were most likely to vote with their feet, Dr
Tan said. </p>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-005#73:3>
<p> Brigadier-General ( Res) Lee's figures, and the comments he made on the
subject, are a reminder that, whatever the merits of Dr Tan's theory, it is
ridiculous to think of the upper middle class in Singapore as a deprived
group.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-005#74:3>
As BG Lee noted, even millionaires could use Singapore's subsidised
services if they chose, except for public housing - which is open to 95 per
cent of the population.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-005#75:3>
And while some of those eligible might feel HDB flats beneath them,
many supposedly well-to-do for eigners, the Japanese in particular,
would only be too happy if they could have anything as good, and on the terms
Singaporeans acquire them.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-005#76:3>
So if there is a middle class squeeze, it is not ground ed on
fact but on expectations and perception.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-005#77:3>
And therein lies the problem.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-005#78:3>
It is probably no where near as large as Dr Tan made out.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-005#79:3>
Indica tions are that many Singaporeans, especially the young,
no longer see the good life in terms solely of such things as ownership of
private property, fancy cars or membership in country clubs.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-005#80:3>
In creasingly, they measure their well-being and sta tus by
acquiring art work, designer clothes, for eign holidays or dining well -
and are well able to indulge these. </p>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-005#81:3>
<p> However, there can be little doubt that there are also many Singaporeans
who do hanker after big cars, a house with a garden and more.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-005#82:3>
And for all that their incomes have risen year after year, along with
everyone else's, the prices of their dream acquisitions have risen much
faster and are thus out of reach.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-005#83:3>
Human beings being what they are, it probably does no good - to point
out that this is inevitable given Singapore's limited size, or to remind them
that they are far better off than their counterparts in Japan, or even the
United States where real incomes have stagnated for two decades and
university graduates with working wives find that they cannot afford the same
houses their blue-collar parents had.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-005#84:3>
How many would actually be driven to emigrate is debatable.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-005#85:3>
But the mismatch between their expec tations and their ability
to meet them is some thing that requires government attention.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-005#86:3>
To dis miss it out of hand would be to feed their unhappiness
and discontent. </p> </I>

<h> <bold> Growth Advocate </bold> </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-005#88:4>
<p> Each rung up the economic ladder from develop ing country to newly
industrialising economy and onward to developed nation becomes increasingly
difficult to attain.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-005#89:4>
It is not only that the scale of economic activities is larger, the
nature of the operations more complex andco-ordination of de
cisionmaking among various parties more intri cate. <X>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-005#X90:4>
The unity of purpose among the population in according the same
priority to economic growth also becomes harder to hold together.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-005#X91:4>
As Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong noted last Thursday at the
Economic Development Board's 30th anniversary dinner, the circum stances
in Singapore are no longer as desperate as in the Sixties when the threat of
a 100,000-strong army of unemployed was breathing the urgency of growth down
everybody's neck.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-005#X92:4>
There is now more room, and sometimes temptation, to argue for
policies on non-economic grounds, even if it means trading off some growth.
</p>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-005#X93:4>
<p> This " we have arrived" syndrome that accompanies economic success is not
entirely bad.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-005#X94:4>
It makes the country kinder and gentler; more
environmentally-conscious, and more supportive of the arts.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-005#X95:4>
But as Brigadier-General ( Res) Lee stressed, the decisions to
trade off economic growth for other social objectives should be made with the
full understanding and acceptance of the implications, and not in the vague
hope that no cost is involved.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-005#X96:4>
To tot up the costs and keep them at the forefront of everybody's
mind, an unswerving advocate of economic growth is needed.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-005#X97:4>
So far, the EDB has played the role of growth advocate to the hilt,
pushing hard to get the entire population to go for growth and helping the
Government to focus all its policies on promoting growth.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-005#X98:4>
As Dr Goh Keng Swee said, without the EDB, some foreign investors
would still have come here.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-005#X99:4>
But many more would not even have considered Singapore, or been
aware of what it had to offer. </p>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-005#X100:4>
<p> The EDB is a perfect counterpoise to the advocates of other social
objectives.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-005#X101:4>
Through its network of overseas offices, it has its pulse on what
the foreign investors really need and what windows of opportunity are being
missed if the pursuit of other social objectives were to pull the shutters
down.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-005#X102:4>
Attaining developed country status will be put out of Singapore's
reach if even the EDB succumbs to the blandishments to take it easy on
economic growth, for the sake of other social objectives.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-005#X103:4>
That is when everyone starts to kid himself that there is no cost
involved.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-005#X104:4>
There will also be no more Texas instrument-like investments taking
off within 50 days, however efficient the civil service continues to be.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-005#X105:4>
The bedrock of Singapore society is continued economic success.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-005#X106:4>
Without that, it cannot pay for gracious living or a cleaner
environment.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-005#X107:4>
The most important lesson the EDB should draw from its past 30
years of contributions to Singapore's economic success is that it must be
steadfast in making the case for the highest sustainable economic growth to
the Government, even if on occasion it might find itself a lone voice crying
in the wilderness for growth. </p>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-005#X108:4>
<p> The EDB must preserve the boldness of its dreams and its role as the
Government's leading entrepreneur.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-005#X109:4>
Three new areas of focus have been outlined by BG Lee for the
board.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-005#X110:4>
One is to promote depth and breadth in those industries that are
niches for Singapore, such as the Winchester disk drive industry.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-005#X111:4>
Another is for the EDB to go international, building on its
operational headquarters programme, its international direct investment
programme and the Growth Triangle project.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-005#X112:4>
The third focus is on contributing to Singapore's manpower
development by building up the existing EDB training centres and institutes
into centres of excellence for core skills, and by tapping the board's
well-established international network to attract overseas talent.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-005#X113:4>
How to keep these new economic objectives high on the agenda of the
Next Lap, amidst the clamour of other non-economic objectives, is the
challenge ahead for the EDB. </p> </X> </I>
