<I>

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-010#1:1:A>
Okay let's get started

<ICE-SIN:S1B-010#2:1:A>
Uhm I'm going to give you a handout

<ICE-SIN:S1B-010#3:1:A>
It's uh there's uh those are the things you're going to 
do today

<ICE-SIN:S1B-010#4:1:A>
I don't know how you're feeling today

<ICE-SIN:S1B-010#5:1:A>
Not too good for me I've got a sore finger uh

<ICE-SIN:S1B-010#6:1:A>
Okay let's get started

<ICE-SIN:S1B-010#7:1:A>
We're going to talk about uh working with parents today 
and uh this
going to be very important because when you go to the primary schools you'll
be working a lot with parents a lot more than when you are in secondary
school alright

<ICE-SIN:S1B-010#8:1:A>
So we're going to look at different aspects of uh 
parent-teacher
relationship and why is it important to establish good relationship with
parents okay

<ICE-SIN:S1B-010#9:1:A>
Do you think you could get settled down and yah

<ICE-SIN:S1B-010#10:1:A>
Okay so uh to start off we want to talk about the 
different types
of uh school-home relationships

<ICE-SIN:S1B-010#11:1:A>
Uhm I re I think most of us are from different types of 
schools uhm
perhaps government schools and others the uh the government-aided school

<ICE-SIN:S1B-010#12:1:A>
So there are actually different types of relationships 
that these
schools have with the family or with parents uh only like to suggest that the
very first type of school is what 'keep out' you know

<ICE-SIN:S1B-010#13:1:A>
This this school will probably say hey you know we we 
run the
business we know all about education so you just do your parenting at home
and leave us alone alright keep out

<ICE-SIN:S1B-010#14:1:A>
So I I think you might have seen signs around in 
schools that say 'Parents
must not enter the school premises unless the the alright

<ICE-SIN:S1B-010#15:1:A>
And there are some other schools called usual school 
and these are
the school that say 'Okay if you wanna come in you are welcome but if you
want if you don't want to come to school that's alright too

<ICE-SIN:S1B-010#16:1:A>
I mean we've called upon you and you don't want to come 
that's fine

<ICE-SIN:S1B-010#17:1:A>
If you want to come that's fine too usual type

<ICE-SIN:S1B-010#18:1:A>
And then of course there are the P-T-A school
parent-teacher association

<ICE-SIN:S1B-010#19:1:A>
Uhm I think a number of schools in Singapore have taken 
this kind
of approach now but mainly I think the pity is that most of them <unclear>
word </unclear> to fund raising

<ICE-SIN:S1B-010#20:1:A>
You know they are referring to curtains ah wanna donate 
money to
build the swimming pool and things like that

<ICE-SIN:S1B-010#21:1:A>
That's about it alright

<ICE-SIN:S1B-010#22:1:A>
And of course there are the true community schools 
where uh surely
you read the report about the new Raffles Girls' school where they're going
to have uh open up the school premises for computer classes <unclear> word
</unclear> in the evening alright where they're going to welcome parents in
to uhm conduct courses for the students in there okay that's a community
school

<ICE-SIN:S1B-010#23:1:A>
So when you go to school the next time you're going to 
see for
yourself what what what kind of school do you think your school falls under

<ICE-SIN:S1B-010#24:1:A>
What category does it fall under okay

<ICE-SIN:S1B-010#25:1:A>
So that's that's just to start you off with types of 
home-school
relationship

<ICE-SIN:S1B-010#26:1:A>
Uhm let's see why is it important to establish good 
parent-teacher
relationship interaction

<ICE-SIN:S1B-010#27:1:A>
You know when the parents come to school uhm they they 
actually see
how the school operates especially the primary school they like to but they
keep them out isn't it

<ICE-SIN:S1B-010#28:1:A>
In primary one they are not allowed to go in but they 
they still
peep through the windows and see what's happening

<ICE-SIN:S1B-010#29:1:A>
So they can see the learning environment and they can 
know what's
the school programs are

<ICE-SIN:S1B-010#30:1:A>
They they they can look at the notice board and see uh 
what sort of
<unclear> word </unclear> programs there are what sort of E-C-A activities
there are alright

<ICE-SIN:S1B-010#31:1:A>
What sort of medium programs and all okay

<ICE-SIN:S1B-010#32:1:A>
So they can actually see uh how teachers teach 
sometimes or maybe
in talking to the teachers they can know what sort of teachers there are in
school uh what sort of approaches they use and things like that

<ICE-SIN:S1B-010#33:1:A>
And very importantly the third point sometimes you may 
have set
some kind of work for students especially weaker ones and you would like them
to be supervised by their stu uh by their parents at home

<ICE-SIN:S1B-010#34:1:A>
So that's when you need parents to supervise and make 
sure that
their children have done the appropriate homework the the assigned homework
alright

<ICE-SIN:S1B-010#35:1:A>
And sometimes the parents will ask you in school uh 
when they talk
with the teachers in in the process of talking with the teachers they can
learn something about how important the parental role is just a guidance and
supervision

<ICE-SIN:S1B-010#36:1:A>
Not only in academic areas but in the others in social 
emotional
development <unclear> word </unclear> right

<ICE-SIN:S1B-010#37:1:A>
And of course parents can make some significant 
significant
contributions to the school

<ICE-SIN:S1B-010#38:1:A>
Ah not sure whether you re have read articles about uh 
schools like
St Nicholas

<ICE-SIN:S1B-010#39:1:A>
Have you read anything about the art where they 
actually ask
parents to come in to talk on certain programs

<ICE-SIN:S1B-010#40:1:A>
Is anybody familiar with that kind of uh interaction 
that St
Nicholas school has

<ICE-SIN:S1B-010#41:1:A>
Do you know what what they do

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-010#42:1:B>
<unclear> word </unclear>

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-010#43:1:A>
Yah they did

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-010#44:1:B>
<unclear> word </unclear>

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-010#45:1:A>
<unclear> word </unclear>

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-010#46:1:B>
Singapore teach uh to teach courses

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-010#47:1:A>
To teach courses I see

<ICE-SIN:S1B-010#48:1:A>
Now what sort of courses can you

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-010#49:1:B>
Story-telling

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-010#50:1:A>
Ah okay story-telling

<ICE-SIN:S1B-010#51:1:A>
Oh parents are involved with reading program

<ICE-SIN:S1B-010#52:1:A>
They actually break the children into small groups and 
parents come
in to read to the kids or they help out in help help out in library work and
things like that okay

<ICE-SIN:S1B-010#53:1:A>
And I think they do something about gardening too right

<ICE-SIN:S1B-010#54:1:A>
So that's an avenue you can tap parents' expertise

<ICE-SIN:S1B-010#55:1:A>
Okay so we say that parents need teachers because 
parents can see
all these things happening but teachers also need parents because they can
use parents to be a member of the teaching team

<ICE-SIN:S1B-010#56:1:A>
It means uh whatever aspect in school the parents can 
go back and
supervise their children alright

<ICE-SIN:S1B-010#57:1:A>
I'm not sure whether you're familiar with this term 
called
contracting

<ICE-SIN:S1B-010#58:1:A>
Sometimes when the kids come to see you and this kid uh 
not very
well-disciplined so you wanna have a contract some kind of a time-table
alright to say that hey watch less of TV and spend that two hours doing Maths
something like that

<ICE-SIN:S1B-010#59:1:A>
You know when you see the parents and you may wanna 
give that
contract with the time-table that kind of thing

<ICE-SIN:S1B-010#60:1:A>
Will you please supervise your child every night for 
two hours
alright

<ICE-SIN:S1B-010#61:1:A>
So the parents can be a member of the teaching team and 
then they
can provide supportive and extend <unclear> word </unclear> experiences
meaning if they can actually <unclear> word </unclear> their children out in
perhaps assessment work you know other <unclear> word </unclear> activities
at home

<ICE-SIN:S1B-010#62:1:A>
What sort of uh educational toys they can buy for their 
children

<ICE-SIN:S1B-010#63:1:A>
Okay and then by doing that you you hope to see a 
snowball effect

<ICE-SIN:S1B-010#64:1:A>
Other parents see that hey uh these parents are 
actually <unclear>
word </unclear> quite involvement with their children's work maybe we should
do likewise or or maybe we should get other parents together and and and come
together to school and uh and help out in the school management or other
school committee alright

<ICE-SIN:S1B-010#65:1:A>
So I hope you can see uh the importance of P-T 
interaction from
there but very often more often than not you hear about complaints about
parents right

<ICE-SIN:S1B-010#66:1:A>
Later on we will talk about problem parents okay and 
how to handle
them

<ICE-SIN:S1B-010#67:1:A>
Okay so after stating the importance of uh P-T 
interaction what are
the ways we can ensure that this kind of interaction work out

<ICE-SIN:S1B-010#68:1:A>
I'm not sure whether you might have some ideas

<ICE-SIN:S1B-010#69:1:A>
I'm sure you can think of meet the parents right

<ICE-SIN:S1B-010#70:1:A>
Did your parents ever go to your school when you were 
in school

<ICE-SIN:S1B-010#71:1:A>
How many of you how many of your parents did

<ICE-SIN:S1B-010#72:1:A>
None of you <O> laughs </O>

<ICE-SIN:S1B-010#73:1:A>
I think they've this thing called Meet the Parents and 
they've lots
of concerts where they invite parents right

<ICE-SIN:S1B-010#74:1:A>
Uh I don't know how many of your parents went to school

<ICE-SIN:S1B-010#75:1:A>
Okay this some of the ways to establish good 
relationship with the
to make the school as a welcoming place

<ICE-SIN:S1B-010#76:1:A>
Uh well as <unclear> word </unclear> says inviting 
school lah you
know facilitating this inviting environment

<ICE-SIN:S1B-010#77:1:A>
Are there things around parents can walk in and see 
that they know
that they are welcomed alright

<ICE-SIN:S1B-010#78:1:A>
They'll talk about I know the oversea they talk about 
parents' room
they even have special bulletin boards for parents you know when they can
hold up some information for parents

<ICE-SIN:S1B-010#79:1:A>
I'm not sure whether this is done in Singapore I don't 
think any
school has a parent room

<ICE-SIN:S1B-010#80:1:A>
I'm not sure if the new A-C-S has a parent room I doubt 
it

<ICE-SIN:S1B-010#81:1:A>
Anyway the idea is to welcome parents coming in

<ICE-SIN:S1B-010#82:1:A>
They could for school assembly

<ICE-SIN:S1B-010#83:1:A>
You may think that these are very western ideas but uh 
there'll be
some there may be some of them which you can modify and and think about

<ICE-SIN:S1B-010#84:1:A>
In the west they talk about morning coffee then uhm you 
know I
think this is done in Singapore where parents help out in outings organising
outings and taking the children out

<ICE-SIN:S1B-010#85:1:A>
Very much so <unclear> word </unclear> because they 
they need
adults around to supervise the children maybe one adult to five children
<unclear> word </unclear> small ones you know

<ICE-SIN:S1B-010#86:1:A>
So I think parents uh can be asked to fork out there

<ICE-SIN:S1B-010#87:1:A>
Okay so these are some of the ways and some very 
specific ways
would be uh written communication where there are class bulletins there there
are newsletters especially for parents got to bring the facts there

<ICE-SIN:S1B-010#88:1:A>
Now I was in the hospital last time <O> laughs </O>

<ICE-SIN:S1B-010#89:1:A>
Yah okay so there are there are special newsletters for 
parents
involve parents in <unclear> word </unclear> in school and future events and
uh some achievements of students there and things like that lah okay

<ICE-SIN:S1B-010#90:1:A>
Uh as far I know <unclear> word </unclear> A-C-S has 
one Report
Express

<ICE-SIN:S1B-010#91:1:A>
Not sure about other schools

<ICE-SIN:S1B-010#92:1:A>
Have you come across any

<ICE-SIN:S1B-010#93:1:A>
I think Heng Boys has one too primary school I because 
my nephew is
from that school

<ICE-SIN:S1B-010#94:1:A>
I think they have one <unclear> word </unclear>

<ICE-SIN:S1B-010#95:1:A>
Do you know of any other primary schools that give 
letters to
parents yeh Cedar 'A' yeh

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-010#96:1:C>
<unclear> word </unclear>

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-010#97:1:A>
Oh it's alright

<ICE-SIN:S1B-010#98:1:A>
There are one of those

<ICE-SIN:S1B-010#99:1:A>
It's a primary school or second primary school is it

<ICE-SIN:S1B-010#100:1:A>
Oh that's good ya

<ICE-SIN:S1B-010#101:1:A>
So the idea is that if there is a this channel of 
communication
with parents letting the parents know about what's happened in school alright

<ICE-SIN:S1B-010#102:1:A>
And uh school report annual report <unclear> word 
</unclear>

<ICE-SIN:S1B-010#103:1:A>
Not sure every student gets it but in some schools 
they do

<ICE-SIN:S1B-010#104:1:A>
School magazines you know alright

<ICE-SIN:S1B-010#105:1:A>
And besides these uh avenues of written communication 
there are al
also a lot of informal discussions that can be carried out but the idea is
that the teachers must not feel threatened

<ICE-SIN:S1B-010#106:1:A>
You know sometimes when parents come in teachers can 
feel a bit
threatened

<ICE-SIN:S1B-010#107:1:A>
What do you want

<ICE-SIN:S1B-010#108:1:A>
Why did what do they complain you know

<ICE-SIN:S1B-010#109:1:A>
And what what do you really want from me

<ICE-SIN:S1B-010#110:1:A>
Uh I I at the other side of the coin some parents also 
feel that
whenever teachers call about it must be that little Tommy is misbehaving
alright

<ICE-SIN:S1B-010#111:1:A>
Uh so you have to establish this kind of understanding 
that uh we
don't call upon you just because there's some problem right

<ICE-SIN:S1B-010#112:1:A>
So that's why these uh morning coffees and uh uh uh at 
evening
just to meet the parents not just to talk about results you know

<ICE-SIN:S1B-010#113:1:A>
Very often at meet-the-parents sessions you you hand 
in your
report book uh and very often you give your report only when the parent come
comes along isn't it

<ICE-SIN:S1B-010#114:1:A>
And we want to make sure that those who fail are the 
parents of
those student who fail must turn up alright

<ICE-SIN:S1B-010#115:1:A>
No but I think the the kind of <unclear> word 
</unclear> uh
<unclear> word </unclear> perpetuate the kind of thinking in parents okay

<ICE-SIN:S1B-010#116:1:A>
So sometimes you get uh whole conferences where 
parents <unclear>
word </unclear> I'm saying that certain schools that arrange for talks and
sessions like uh parenting style and how to be an assertive parent how to
bring up your child gracefully whatever is <X>

<ICE-SIN:S1B-010#X117:1:A>
There are such talks around <unclear> word </unclear> 
and then of
course your informal contact Sometimes you will need to interview the parents
You're talking about counselling contexts now uh where you want to find out a
lot more about how the children are a child is like he's at home So you may
want to set up parental interview Okay and uh working with parents in a small
groups like maybe on a specific for specific problem maybe there are some
kids with uh problem with the inthing now is obesity ya Terrible <unclear>
word </unclear> you're a member of the fattish club ya they should say
something like a health club or trimming club ya Maybe their children with
that kind of problems alright And and so you might want to get them to
generate and discuss how to help them help their child with this problem
alright Uhm for specific interest groups And just to reach out to the working
parents you may want to think about evening informal evenings Uh it's not
terribly good to have uhm meeting with parents on Saturday morning I mean not
everybody Well we have to work on Saturday morning Some parents have to work
on Saturday mornings too Maybe a Friday evening or something like that And a
very important tool is really home visitation We're talking about home
visitation and the counselling technique We're going to link it with what
you've done last week counselling Uh what do you do when you go when you have
to go to a child's home What what can you actually see when you go to
someone's home I'm very tempted to do that exercise Maybe I'll have Why don't
you talk to your the person next to you alright and and just tell the person
<unclear> word </unclear> just about your describe your room to that person
or your house You can talk about what kind of painting <unclear> word
</unclear> on the wall whether you have shelves or posters whether you have
karaoke sets <unclear> word </unclear> </X> </I>
