<h> THE NATION-PORT </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-004#2:1>
The story of the port is really the story of Singapore.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-004#3:1>
The existence of Temasek and the arrival of Stamford Raffles are of
such momentous importance to the history and economic development of
Singapore that they form part of every child's education.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-004#4:1>
Even visitors get to know about it when they come to Singapore.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-004#5:1>
This familiar tale has been told and retold so many times that the
role of the port in the Singapore success story is often taken for granted.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-004#6:1>
That our nation began and thrived as a port is hardly in dispute.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-004#7:1>
Everybody knows that Singapore had its humble beginnings as a riverine
port on the banks of the Singapore River.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-004#8:1>
What is not so widely known is that the Port of Singapore is now as
vital - if not more so - to the nation's prosperity as it was before.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-004#9:1>
If the port began as the country's ricebowl, it has now evolved to
scoop up generous helpings of grain as well.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-004#10:1>
When it comes to the port, one cannot help but use superlatives.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-004#11:1>
With 600 ships anchored in the harbour at any one time and one
leaving the port every seven minutes, Singapore has been the world's busiest
port since 1982.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-004#12:1>
Cargo volume has steadily increased and in 1989, the port handled a
staggering 173 million tonnes of cargo.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-004#13:1>
This busy and modern port continues to grow at a frenetic pace,
regularly chalking up record figures which have turned it into one of the
world's largest container ports.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-004#14:1>
In 1989, it reached a new milestone of handling 4.36 million TEUs (
containers calculated in twenty-foot equivalent units).

<ICE-SIN:W2B-004#15:1>
This works out to 38 containers handled every hour a vessel is
alongside a berth, with a vessel turning around in 10 hours.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-004#16:1>
The port is fast expanding its container services: in the second half
of the 1980s, it has recorded an average container growth rate of 25 per
cent.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-004#17:1>
In addition to being the world's busiest port in terms of shipping
tonnage, Singapore remains the top bunkering ( ship refuelling) port in the
world, supplying nearly 11 million tonnes of bunkers to vessels every year.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-004#18:1>
This is a benefit, no doubt, of being also the third largest oil
refining centre in the world.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-004#19:1>
But despite these impressive figures, many Singaporeans still retain
an image of portworkers as tanned coolies balancing sacks of grain on their
shoulders, as portrayed in popular paintings of the Singapore River.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-004#20:1>
This is a perception arrested in time which, hopefully, will be
updated by this volume commemorating Singapore's silver jubilee.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-004#21:1>
The commissioning of Tanjong Pagar Terminal ( TPT) in 1972 was an
important milestone for the port.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-004#22:1>
On its tenth anniversary, TPT handled the magical one millionth TEU
from the mv Neptune Garnet ( left).

<ICE-SIN:W2B-004#23:1>
It was also in 1982 that Singapore became the world's busiest port.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-004#24:1>
Preceding page: This 19th century woodcut records the harsh
conditions of the earliest coolies.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-004#25:1>
They worked more than 15 hours a day for meagre wages.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-004#26:1>
Today's portworkers are among the most productive in Singapore.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-004#27:1>
And their efficiency does not go unrewarded since they are generously
paid.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-004#28:1>
After all, they have to be well-trained and computer-literate to work
in a high-tech port which makes extensive use of state-of-the-art technology,
as befits a port serving a nation bent on becoming a City of Excellence in
the 21st century.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-004#29:1>
A global port for a global technopolis, this is what the Port of
Singapore aims to be.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-004#30:1>
Sprouting from an initial cluster of dusty godowns on the southern
seafront, it has evolved to include other sections of the coast as well.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-004#31:1>
Its present 15 kilometres of wharves, taking up seven per cent of the
island's coastline, make it truly a nation-port.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-004#32:1>
Much more important than size, though, is the current scale and
diversity of port operations.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-004#33:1>
Many Singaporeans think that the port merely handles imports and
exports, bringing consumer goods into the country and sending off the
products of our industries.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-004#34:1>
Highly efficient and competitive with the best ports in the world,
the Port of Singapore is an invaluable national resource.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-004#35:1>
It functions more like a one-stop shipping and distribution centre
ringed by " distriparks" or zones of modern warehouses sited close to the
port terminals.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-004#36:1>
And with the growing sea-air trade, the world's busiest port is
linked by fast expressways to Changi, one of the world's busiest airports.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-004#37:1>
Looking ahead, the managers are well prepared to take the port into
the next century.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-004#38:1>
From containers to cruises to maritime conferences, this
multi-faceted nation-port is gearing up for exciting new developments such as
freight futures, ship management and ship broking services which will enhance
its role as a premier maritime centre.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-004#39:1>
Hence, from a broader perspective, the port and the nation are
inseparable as future growth in the port will be in tandem with Singapore's
development as a global economy.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-004#40:1>
Just as Singapore works hard to attract investments of talent and
technology to fuel its dynamism, the port shines like the brightest beacon to
attract ships.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-004#41:1>
This held true in the very beginning just as it does today, and it
will still hold true in the future.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-004#42:1>

<h> DARK SEAS, BRIGHT LIGHTS </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-004#45:1>
It is a clear, moonlit night, and the stars beckon to the traveller.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-004#46:1>
The mv ( motor vessel) Eastern Highway slices smoothly through a
slightly choppy South China Sea towards her destination.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-004#47:1>
The crew on deck are eager to reach shore, but for the moment, they
are just enjoying the serenity of the night.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-004#48:1>
Weeks earlier, the 153-metre multi-deck car carrier collected a
consignment of new Japanese cars before setting sail from Hiroshima.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-004#49:1>
Unknown to the car carrier, another vessel is steaming several
nautical miles in her wake in the darkness.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-004#50:1>
Headed in the same direction, the mv Audinet is coming from the Gulf
of Thailand, after having lifted anchor at Bangkok.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-004#51:1>
At about the same time, but a peninsula away, the mv Neptune Garnet
is travelling effortlessly along one of the busiest shipping channels in the
world.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-004#52:1>
The Strait of Malacca is calm except for occasional swells as the sea
heaves its bosom and shimmers in the moonlight.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-004#53:1>
It is a perfect night for star-gazing, an activity which mariners of
yore had to undertake in order to check sailing directions.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-004#54:1>
But now on the brightly-lit bridge of this container ship, Captain
Parvez confirms that she is on course as scheduled with a reading of the
ship's compass.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-004#55:1>
It has been a long haul for the master and crew and they will be glad
for a well-earned rest soon enough.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-004#56:1>
Suez has been the Neptune Garnet's last port of call; the container
ship has then voyaged through the Arabian Sea, across the vast expanse of the
Indian Ocean and the Bay of Bengal.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-004#57:1>
Such a passage across the open seas was not undertaken by the mv
Equator, a coaster better suited to transporting cargo in bags and crates
from port to port in the region.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-004#58:1>
Sailing from almost the opposite direction, from Sipitang in Sabah,
she will soon be docking to pick up her next shipment of consumer goods.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-004#59:1>
Unsighted by the Equator is the mv Roda Perkasa, which at the moment
appears only as a tiny speck of light in the faraway distance.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-004#60:1>
The bulk carrier is a bigger vessel which started her journey at
Tanjong Priok, near Jarkarta.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-004#61:1>
Literally in the dark, from different points of the compass, all five
ships are being drawn as if by a giant invisible magnet towards the world's
busiest port.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-004#62:1>
From the north steams the Audinet with a combination of containerised
cargo and crated rubber and textiles; from the south, the Roda Perkasa is
ferrying cement clinker from Indonesia; from the east, the coaster Equator is
laden with local produce, mainly cocoa beans and pepper; from the northeast
chugs the Eastern Highway like a seaborne carpark with her decks of
motor-cars.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-004#63:1>
Finally the Neptune Garnet, the biggest of the five vessels, is
approaching from the northwest with sealed containers carrying goods which
range from machinery to foodstuffs.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-004#64:1>
Above: This l9th century woodcut depicts coaling activity at night.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-004#65:1>
The coolies worked in pairs, hauling 160 lb bags of coal on their
bare shoulders.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-004#68:1>
As the five ships converge steadily on Singapore, the majority of the
population slumbers on, blissfully unaware of the night visitors or that
another 100 ships will arrive in our waters before daybreak.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-004#69:1>
Nor are they aware that more than 38,000 ships from over 700 shipping
lines visit our nation-port every year.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-004#70:1>
On board the ships, however, crew members are most aware of the next
stopover in Singapore, which some historians believe got its name from the
19th century usage of " singgah" and " pura", meaning " the city where one
breaks one's journey".

<ICE-SIN:W2B-004#71:1>
In anticipation, some even go on deck to scan the horizon.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-004#72:1>
To ships on the open sea, Singapore is very brightly lit at night, a
welcome beacon that can be detected by weary travellers even beyond the
distant horizon.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-004#73:1>
From as far out as 15 nautical miles, you can see the glow of the
city at night.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-004#74:1>
About 10 nautical miles away, the lights of tall buildings,
especially those on the east coast, are visible.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-004#75:1>
In fact, making a good first-time impression with a royal visitor was
how Singapore got its name.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-004#76:1>
According to the Sejarah Melayu ( Malay Annals), the title " Lion
City" was inspired by a legendary encounter between a Sumatran prince and the
noble beast on our sandy shores.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-004#77:1>
Like all vessels travelling into Singapore waters, these five ships
will dock at one of the five modern wharves or terminals, as they are now
called.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-004#78:1>
Tanjong Pagar Terminal handles containerised cargo such as computers
and garments.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-004#79:1>
General cargo, such as local produce and foodstuff, is loaded and
unloaded at both Keppel and Pasir Panjang, the latter specializing also in
coastal cargo.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-004#80:1>
Jurong is the port of call for ships transporting dry bulk cargo, for
instance cement and grain.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-004#81:1>
Cars come into the country at Sembawang, which also handles other
high volume cargo, such as timber for example.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-004#82:1>
And at the berth, each vessel is guaranteed a fast, efficient
round-the-clock service so that she can be turned around and be on her way as
soon as possible.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-004#83:1>
Time, as they say, is money and the Port of Singapore Authority (
PSA) has perfected the art of satisfying its customers to an exact science.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-004#84:1>
There is no other way to describe the non-stop buzz of computers,
high-tech machines and the talented, trained staff who run the system like
clockwork, or the zeal applied to employee productivity as measured by "
turnround time" or " number of containers handled per vessel hour".

<ICE-SIN:W2B-004#85:1>

The master of the Neptune Garnet knows that everything has been
meticulously planned down to the very last detail long before his ship
breaches the port limits.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-004#89:1>
Everything actually began five days ago when the ship owners, Neptune
Orient Lines, applied for a berth at Tanjong Pagar Terminal through PORTNET,
a computer network set up by the PSA to cut down paper transactions and
streamline its operations.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-004#90:1>
Within hours, the schedule for the container yard crane was drawn up.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-004#91:1>
Space was allocated for containers destined for the Neptune Garnet.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-004#92:1>
Over the next two days, all the documentation was completed; the
export containers were stuffed at the container freight station and
transhipment containers from other ships were positioned in the yard to speed
up the loading on board the vessel.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-004#93:1>
The computerized Berth Allocation System has also automatically
triggered off orders for pilots and tugboats to be assigned to the vessel.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-004#94:1>
Hence, as the Neptune Garnet steams smoothly through the Phillip
Channel in the early morning hours, Master Parvez is waiting on the bridge,
ready to receive the PSA pilot, Mr TK Tay, at the Eastern Boarding Ground.
<X>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-004#X95:1>
His job is to guide the vessel into port.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-004#X96:1>
The first thing Mr Tay does as he comes on board is to check the
condition of the ship and discuss the berthing manoeuvres with the master.
