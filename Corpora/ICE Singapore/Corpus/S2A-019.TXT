<ICE-SIN:S2A-019#1:1:A>
We certainly don't want to lose Fandi Ahmad not with only
eighteen minutes of play gone by

<ICE-SIN:S2A-019#2:1:A>
Abbas Said has uh come down to Fandi's mid-field role momentarily
and allowed Fan uh Sundram Moorthy to take his place upfront

<ICE-SIN:S2A-019#3:1:A>
So Singapore playing with ten men now

<ICE-SIN:S2A-019#4:1:A>
Nazri well charged in

<ICE-SIN:S2A-019#5:1:A>
Malek

<ICE-SIN:S2A-019#6:1:A>
Kin Hong clears it

<ICE-SIN:S2A-019#7:1:A>
Kadir wins it Abbas

<ICE-SIN:S2A-019#8:1:A>
Good click on by Lim Chong Kim and nice ball played outside by Radi
Martin

<ICE-SIN:S2A-019#9:1:A>
Kian Wee will chase for this

<ICE-SIN:S2A-019#10:1:A>
He keeps it in play well done

<ICE-SIN:S2A-019#11:1:A>
Paced by Saswa nice move onto David Fariszuan but Malek steps in

<ICE-SIN:S2A-019#12:1:A>
I must say that the Kedah coach has certainly done his homework

<ICE-SIN:S2A-019#13:1:A>
Oh that's a nice sign Fandi Ahmad indicating that he's a okay and
ready to come back onto the pitch of play

<ICE-SIN:S2A-019#14:1:A>
Jang Jung is charging in

<ICE-SIN:S2A-019#15:1:A>
Oh nice little flick on by V Sundram Moorthy

<ICE-SIN:S2A-019#16:1:A>
A lot of shirt tugging on the referee didn't see it

<ICE-SIN:S2A-019#17:1:A>
Good play by Sundram though magnificent skill under the face of
pressure

<ICE-SIN:S2A-019#18:1:A>
Abbas Said just wasn't there

<ICE-SIN:S2A-019#19:1:A>
The cross came in a little bit too early but Abbas deciding to
cross it back again

<ICE-SIN:S2A-019#20:1:A>
Alistair Edwards is good on the shot

<ICE-SIN:S2A-019#21:1:A>
Well blocked out that time by Lee Kian Ong but certainly there was
some shirt tugging on the part of uh Faridza Ismail

<ICE-SIN:S2A-019#22:1:A>
But there are some space now for Kadir Yahya

<ICE-SIN:S2A-019#23:1:A>
Good tackle and the ball goes out and a throw in for Singapore and
the referee will have to check on the shirt tugging and all the indecent play
at the moment

<ICE-SIN:S2A-019#24:1:A>
We should call it from Faridza Ismail he has certainly been pulling
Sundram back and coming in with very very high challenges

<ICE-SIN:S2A-019#25:1:A>
Sundram turned on and says serve you right

<ICE-SIN:S2A-019#26:1:A>
Big blast at right at his chest

<ICE-SIN:S2A-019#27:1:A>
Don't fool around with me

<ICE-SIN:S2A-019#28:1:A>
You can't with that sort of service though by Kadir Yahya

<ICE-SIN:S2A-019#29:1:A>
Nazri will win this one

<ICE-SIN:S2A-019#30:1:A>
Good play by Nazri

<ICE-SIN:S2A-019#31:1:A>
Faridza Ismail comes in with another big challenge and Singapore
get their second corner of the evening and they're coming closer now fired up
by the Kallang roar here

<ICE-SIN:S2A-019#32:1:A>
Certainly the best support in South-East Asia and that we can
certainly find at the National Stadium

<ICE-SIN:S2A-019#33:1:A>
A corner kick for Singapore Malek Awab will take this one

<ICE-SIN:S2A-019#34:1:A>
Few players waiting at the penalty box ready to pounce and it's Lim
Tong Hai

<ICE-SIN:S2A-019#35:1:A>
Wow a goal by Lim Tong Hai magnificent

<ICE-SIN:S2A-019#36:1:A>
He came in late he ran from deep <unclear> word </unclear> and if
you still can't forgive Lim Tong Hai for what he did in the SEA Games I tell
you there must be something wrong with you

<ICE-SIN:S2A-019#37:1:A>
What a goal by Tong Hai magnificent run from deep <unclear> word
</unclear>

<ICE-SIN:S2A-019#38:1:A>
The ball was very inviting hanging in the air by Malek Awab

<ICE-SIN:S2A-019#39:1:A>
The goalkeeper came up with a challenge but Tong Hai didn't care
two hoots at all about Ahmad Sobri

<ICE-SIN:S2A-019#40:1:A>
He went he banged a header in and what a goal that was for
Singapore

<ICE-SIN:S2A-019#41:1:A>
One nil with one twenty-one minutes of play gone by

<ICE-SIN:S2A-019#42:1:A>
A goalkeeper claimed that Sundram Moorthy was blocking and he ran
up free to the referee afterwards to say that Sundram was blocking his view
and obstructing him but the referee says no goal

<ICE-SIN:S2A-019#43:1:A>
Kedah attack straight away oh look who's there again Lim Tong Hai
fired up by this evening and even more so now with that goal

<ICE-SIN:S2A-019#44:1:A>
And the Singapore defenders covering for each other so well

<ICE-SIN:S2A-019#45:1:A>
Can almost <unclear> word </unclear> coming back again in the team

<ICE-SIN:S2A-019#46:1:A>
Team spirit is very high and Nazri Nasir is on a high himself

<ICE-SIN:S2A-019#47:1:A>
And some space now for Malek Awab as the Kedah defenders move
forward to try to reduce the deficit and get the equaliser

<ICE-SIN:S2A-019#48:1:A>
Good ball in fact sight

<ICE-SIN:S2A-019#49:1:A>
No support though and yet he's taken shot from an acute angle

<ICE-SIN:S2A-019#50:1:A>
Well a good build-up and a nice counterattack from Singapore

<ICE-SIN:S2A-019#51:1:A>
The Kedah players now will have to move up front and try to get a
goal back and that will allow some of Singapore's ball players more room to
move especially players like Sundram Moorthy Fandi Ahmad and Alistair Edwards

<ICE-SIN:S2A-019#52:1:A>
It's the second goal of the season

<ICE-SIN:S2A-019#53:1:A>
Fandi Alistair trying to work something in the air here for
Singapore

<ICE-SIN:S2A-019#54:1:A>
It's still in the air the ball's not down yet

<ICE-SIN:S2A-019#55:1:A>
Finally it is brought down by Lee Kian Hong the lion <unclear> word
</unclear> take control of things for Kedah

<ICE-SIN:S2A-019#56:1:A>
And Kedah players are certainly coming in very hard on the
Singapore players Malek getting it up

<ICE-SIN:S2A-019#57:1:A>
Ought to be fair and to give credit to the Kedah coach Robert
Alberts

<ICE-SIN:S2A-019#58:1:A>
He has done his homework and he has done tried every mean and
trying another five Singapore's white flank even to uh shirt tugging which
they've done on to Sundram Moorthy

<ICE-SIN:S2A-019#59:1:A>
There he is Robert Alberts the Dutch coach

<ICE-SIN:S2A-019#60:1:A>
Left to be seen especially in the game against Selangor

<ICE-SIN:S2A-019#61:1:A>
Never write a side off just like that least of all Kedah

<ICE-SIN:S2A-019#62:1:A>
Mohamud Sobri hasn't had very good experiences here at the National
Stadium that's his eleventh goal conceded on this ground

<ICE-SIN:S2A-019#63:1:A>
The Kallang wave just urging the team on Sundram will chase for
this

<ICE-SIN:S2A-019#64:1:A>
Good work by Sundram Moorthy he wins a throw in very smart play

<ICE-SIN:S2A-019#65:1:A>
Oh considering that he's been so unfairly treated by his opponents
this evening I think Sundram has come up very well to the challenge so far

<ICE-SIN:S2A-019#66:1:A>
Malek Awab with a long throw

<ICE-SIN:S2A-019#67:1:A>
Alistair Edwards takes it on his chest fires a back kick to no
effect though

<ICE-SIN:S2A-019#68:1:A>
Tong Hai confidence coming back in him the way he controlled the
ball

<ICE-SIN:S2A-019#69:1:A>
Jang Jung nice little ball turning defend into attack straight away
and look at the time the referee had to stop it but he allows play to go on

<ICE-SIN:S2A-019#70:1:A>
Fandi Ahmad with some space now

<ICE-SIN:S2A-019#71:1:A>
Well he was a a little bit apprehensive with a shot

<ICE-SIN:S2A-019#72:1:A>
At first he decided to take it down <unclear> word </unclear> when
the defender came to him he was uh a little shaken by the sight of the
defender in front of face and just decided to have a blast at goal that went
wide

<ICE-SIN:S2A-019#73:1:A>
Radi Martin loses control over the ball

<ICE-SIN:S2A-019#74:1:A>
Sundram gets it once again kicked from behind but the referee saw
nothing of it

<ICE-SIN:S2A-019#75:1:A>
A very poor decision coming from the Selangor referee

<ICE-SIN:S2A-019#76:1:A>
And that time for no reason a foul on the Kedah player he's called
it

<ICE-SIN:S2A-019#77:1:A>
Malek had to come up to clear helping Kadir Yahya a little bit on
his defensive duties

<ICE-SIN:S2A-019#78:1:A>
Fariza Ismail very closely watching Sundram Moorthy

<ICE-SIN:S2A-019#79:1:A>
Game is not over yet for Singapore

<ICE-SIN:S2A-019#80:1:A>
Radi Martin has the ball and some space now

<ICE-SIN:S2A-019#81:1:A>
Jang Jung comes back

<ICE-SIN:S2A-019#82:1:A>
He has been the player of the match so far Jang Jung doing so very
well in defence

<ICE-SIN:S2A-019#83:1:A>
He's cut all of the Kedah crosses and passes into the Singapore
penalty area

<ICE-SIN:S2A-019#84:1:A>
That's his zone and he's taking the real command of it

<ICE-SIN:S2A-019#85:1:A>
Fandi good play despite uh adversity then

<ICE-SIN:S2A-019#86:1:A>
Alistair Edwards will try to run at goal

<ICE-SIN:S2A-019#87:1:A>
Good work here by Alistair Edwards showing nice burst of pace

<ICE-SIN:S2A-019#88:1:A>
Abbas Said with Oahbumi right in front of him decided not to take
any chances at all with the challenge and risk and injury

<ICE-SIN:S2A-019#89:1:A>
Sawas coming back <unclear> word </unclear> is so very strong in
the air and that time Sawas does well

<ICE-SIN:S2A-019#90:1:A>
Malek Awab though incharacteristically losing the ball

<ICE-SIN:S2A-019#91:1:A>
Good work by Kedah Nice one-touch football that finally cleared

<ICE-SIN:S2A-019#92:1:A>
Saban not a very good clearance

<ICE-SIN:S2A-019#93:1:A>
Fandi decided to come in and look at the referee indicating that
that was a leg raised but no foul was given

<ICE-SIN:S2A-019#94:1:A>
Kadir will have to clear he does it superbly

<ICE-SIN:S2A-019#95:1:A>
Abbas Said now with Oahbumi in front of him

<ICE-SIN:S2A-019#96:1:A>
Heels of ball from the Nigerian and definitely a foul a tackle
coming so high Abbas Said is really <unclear> word </unclear> at the moment
working and Oahbumi Adigon receives a yellow card

<ICE-SIN:S2A-019#97:1:A>
So two Kedah players on a yellow card Oahbumi and Lee Kian Hong
both defenders

<ICE-SIN:S2A-019#98:1:A>
That should at least check on their high tackles now

<ICE-SIN:S2A-019#99:1:A>
Certainly good news for Singapore Alistair does well with a header

<ICE-SIN:S2A-019#100:1:A>
Sundram good screening of the ball releases Alistair Edwards and
Hadith Martin trying to ease the pressure a little bit on the Kedah defender
who's deciding the clear the ball and give it out for a throw in to Singapore

<ICE-SIN:S2A-019#101:1:A>
Half an hour play gone by one nil to Singapore

<ICE-SIN:S2A-019#102:1:A>
Good ball by Sundram to Malek but Malek's cross was easily headed
out by Adigon

<ICE-SIN:S2A-019#103:1:A>
Fandi Ahmad trying to weave his way round to players

<ICE-SIN:S2A-019#104:1:A>
That dance ended though with a tackle on him

<ICE-SIN:S2A-019#105:1:A>
Kadir Yahya and Fandi will now come in

<ICE-SIN:S2A-019#106:1:A>
Good play by Fandi

<ICE-SIN:S2A-019#107:1:A>
Abbas Said has some space decided to take on the control instead
of using Sundram Moorthy

<ICE-SIN:S2A-019#108:1:A>
A lot of players falling down the pitch is a little slippery and
at the same time both teams coming in with crunching tackles

<ICE-SIN:S2A-019#109:1:A>
They're not allowing players any time on the ball at all

<ICE-SIN:S2A-019#110:1:A>
A real fierce competitive football game we have here a delightful
one as well

<ICE-SIN:S2A-019#111:1:A>
Sundram good ball control releases Abbas a first time cross

<ICE-SIN:S2A-019#112:1:A>
Malek heading it back

<ICE-SIN:S2A-019#113:1:A>
Nazri now with some space

<ICE-SIN:S2A-019#114:1:A>
Is he gonna shoot

<ICE-SIN:S2A-019#115:1:A>
No he tries to use Alistair Edwards in the penalty box

<ICE-SIN:S2A-019#116:1:A>
Good tackle by Lim Tong Hai

<ICE-SIN:S2A-019#117:1:A>
Here's Malek Awab

<ICE-SIN:S2A-019#118:1:A>
Fandi now turns

<ICE-SIN:S2A-019#119:1:A>
No support

<ICE-SIN:S2A-019#120:1:A>
Oh what a pass exquisite ball by Fandi Ahmad

<ICE-SIN:S2A-019#121:1:A>
How did he spot Malek Kawab

<ICE-SIN:S2A-019#122:1:A>
Malek's cross though was a little bit disappointing but the way
Fandi spotted Malek his vision there was impeccable

<ICE-SIN:S2A-019#123:1:A>
That's certainly good spell for Singapore Sundram oh the tackle
coming in so hard again

<ICE-SIN:S2A-019#124:1:A>
That's magic for you Sundram Moorthy

<ICE-SIN:S2A-019#125:1:A>
A ball inside was actually a very good one cause Abbas Said made a
very late one but well read though by Addi Boon

<ICE-SIN:S2A-019#126:1:A>
Sawas heading it into space

<ICE-SIN:S2A-019#127:1:A>
Nakitin win chase back and win it but only for a short while

<ICE-SIN:S2A-019#128:1:A>
I don't know what Ng Tiong Kim had in mind then but he certainly
didn't tug Fandi out

<ICE-SIN:S2A-019#129:1:A>
Offside it would have been anyway

<ICE-SIN:S2A-019#130:1:A>
They shouldn't give a ball away in mid-field so easily like what
Nazri did

<ICE-SIN:S2A-019#131:1:A>
A reprieve over them because it's a throw in for Singapore much to
Kedah's dismay

<ICE-SIN:S2A-019#132:1:A>
They were hoping that the referee would see it the other way

<ICE-SIN:S2A-019#133:1:A>
Twelve minutes of play left in the first half Singapore lead by a
Lim Tong Hai goal to nil

<ICE-SIN:S2A-019#134:1:A>
Abbas leaving it for Fandi

<ICE-SIN:S2A-019#135:1:A>
Good work by Fandi and Abbas

<ICE-SIN:S2A-019#136:1:A>
Nice little combination Abbas' ball was uh more strange than
anything else

<ICE-SIN:S2A-019#137:1:A>
Jang Jung the heart of every clearance

<ICE-SIN:S2A-019#138:1:A>
Nazri heading the ball back to Malek Awab and uh some trouble for
awhile until Tong Hai steps in to clear

<ICE-SIN:S2A-019#139:1:A>
And despite some uh good play by Kedah in mid-field believe it or
not Abdul Malek hasn't been tested yet and they haven't had a shot at goal

<ICE-SIN:S2A-019#140:1:A>
So considering that I mean Singapore's doing very well defensively
especially in particular Jang Jung

<ICE-SIN:S2A-019#141:1:A>
Nakitin once again doing very well with the jump

<ICE-SIN:S2A-019#142:1:A>
Oh good skill but that finish was disappointing

<ICE-SIN:S2A-019#143:1:A>
A good play by Peter Nakitin showing us what he can do on the air
and on the ground

<ICE-SIN:S2A-019#144:1:A>
And he is again on the ball stirring it upfront

<ICE-SIN:S2A-019#145:1:A>
He knows that his strikers would do the leap ball but with strike
falls on Fandi Abbas Malek Alistair and Sundram we certainly do have a lot of
confidence in them

<ICE-SIN:S2A-019#146:1:A>
Some names so long will strike fear in any defences heart

<ICE-SIN:S2A-019#147:1:A>
Oh nice flick by V Sundram Moorthy Sawasdi Matha Dazuki with some
space and room to take a shot

<ICE-SIN:S2A-019#148:1:A>
The finishing product though was very disappointing

<ICE-SIN:S2A-019#149:1:A>
Jang Jung easily done

<ICE-SIN:S2A-019#150:1:A>
Sundram hastily who is quite bothered by the challenges dished out
on him this evening Sundram

<ICE-SIN:S2A-019#151:1:A>
Fandi squeezing pass two players and releasing Malek Awab

<ICE-SIN:S2A-019#152:1:A>
That's definitely a foul and uh a yellow card it should be because
Malek was on the way to the byline <X>

<ICE-SIN:S2A-019#X153:1:A>
That should have been a yellow card a foul on any who's brought
the referee <unclear> word </unclear> the Singapore player down off the ball
incident And the referee has decided to uh allow Radi Martin struck free and
the Kedah player should be thanking his lucky starts for that Singapore goal
do have a free kick from that and another chance to score Tong Hai's in the
penalty box trying to get his grace Sundram Alistair as well A free kick
though by Abbas was floated too close to Ahmad Sibri No one shutting down Lim
Chong Kim at the moment That's Sawas </X> </I>
