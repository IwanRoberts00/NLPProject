<h> 1 GROWING VEGETABLES IN SINGAPORE? </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2D-013#4:1>
Growing of vegetables in one's own garden is a common hobby for many
households in the west.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-013#5:1>
It is usual for housewives to harvest their own fresh potatoes,
cabbages and other vegetables from their backyards for family consumption or
even to give away to friends.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-013#6:1>
One may argue that such a hobby is only possible in the west where the
compounds of their premises are large and space can be allocated for the
establishment of a vegetable garden.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-013#7:1>
Except for a few fortunate households which have relatively large land
areas, can we in Singapore indulge in such a hobby?

<ICE-SIN:W2D-013#8:1>
The answer is a definite 'yes'.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-013#9:1>
Establishing a backyard vegetable garden does not require a big piece
of land.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-013#10:1>
You can begin with a small area of about 5 m2 ( 1m by 5 m plot or any
other dimensions).

<ICE-SIN:W2D-013#11:1>
This plot is ideally manageable for a hobbyist, whilst also adequate,
to grow a reasonable amount of vegetables to satisfy part of the vegetable
needs of the family.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-013#12:1>
This means that such a plot can be established in the backyards of
most terrace houses, semi- detached houses and bungalows.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-013#13:1>
Even in condominiums and HDB apartments, growing of some leafy
vegetables may be possible at the balcony if a proper trough is installed and
if there is adequate sunlight ( the trough with the vegetables must be
exposed to the morning or afternoon sun for at least 4 to 5 hours a day).

<ICE-SIN:W2D-013#14:1>
A fibre glass trough will be ideal as it is light and does not add
too much load to the building structure.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-013#15:1>
The emphasis of this handbook, however is on the establishment of
backyard vegetable plots on landed properties.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-013#16:1>
I am fortunate to have a compound house and the contents of this book
are entirely based on my experiences of " farming" a backyard garden.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-013#17:1>
Although you would still need to purchase various types of vegetables
to satisfy everyday needs, it is a wonderful experience for you to be able to
go to the backyard to harvest your own vegetables; to wash and to cook them
immediately for the dinner table.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-013#18:1>
One can enjoy the real 'freshness' from these fruits of one's labour.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-013#19:1>
Besides, it keeps the gardener fit and healthy through the
performance of physical activities and the outdoor lifestyle associated with
gardening.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-013#20:1>
What then are the areas within the house premises which can be used
for the establishment of a vegetable plot without affecting the aesthetics of
the garden and other landscape features?

<ICE-SIN:W2D-013#21:1>
Some of the possible sites that can be set aside for a vegetable plot
are shown below.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-013#22:1>
If well maintained, such a vegetable plot can also serve as a
decorative feature within the house garden.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-013#23:1>
CHILLI Scientific Name: Capsicum annuum L

<ICE-SIN:W2D-013#24:1>
<h> 1 Establishment of Plant </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2D-013#25:1>
The common red chillies can easily be grown at a corner of your
vegetable plot or within planting pots.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-013#26:1>
Two or three plants will be more than adequate for your kitchen
needs.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-013#27:1>
Both methods of cultivation require the initial sowing of seeds
within a pot filled with a soil and compost mixture in the proportion of 2:1.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-013#28:1>
There is no need to specially purchase chilli seeds as those taken
from red or dried chillies purchased from your wet market can be used.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-013#29:1>
The seeds are sown in pots and lightly raked into the soil.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-013#30:1>
The soil is then watered daily.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-013#31:1>
The seeds will germinate in a matter of 7 to 10 days.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-013#32:1>
If you want the chilli plants grown within the vegetable plot, the
seedlings can be transplanted with the aid of a hand trowel about 5 weeks
after sowing.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-013#33:1>
However, if it is intended to establish the plant in the pot, then
the other weaker seedlings should be thinned out and only the most sturdy
ones are left to continue their growth to maturity.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-013#34:1>
Manure the plants lightly ( about 5 g per plant) after the thinning
process.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-013#35:1>
<h> 2 Management </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2D-013#36:1>
Chilli plants are hardy and grow well either in the pots or within
the vegetable plot, especially if the soil is well manured.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-013#37:1>
In order to encourage branching of the plant so that more fruits can
be borne, the terminal buds of some of the branches should be nipped off.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-013#38:1>
The plants will begin to bear flower, about 1/2 months from the time
of sowing.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-013#39:1>
The soil around the chilli plants should continue to be lightly
forked with a hand fork to improve soil aeration.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-013#40:1>
For those chilli plants grown in a pot, some compost should be added
to improve the quality of the soil to sustain good growth.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-013#41:1>
<h> 3 Pests and Diseases </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2D-013#42:1>
The most common pest of chilli plants is the white fruit fly.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-013#43:1>
The adults normally reside on the underside of leaves.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-013#44:1>
As there are only a few plants, frequent inspection and removal of
the infested leaves may control the insect to some extent.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-013#45:1>
If the whole plant is heavily infested, it is advisable to remove the
plant and dispose of it in a sealed plastic bag.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-013#46:1>
There should then be a short interval before another chilli plant is
cultivated.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-013#47:1>
As there may only be one or two chilli plants, it would not be
beneficial to treat them with pesticides.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-013#48:1>
As for diseases, viral infection of the young leaves can be common.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-013#49:1>
Infected leaves assume a smaller size than the normal leaves and they
appear wrinkled and curled.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-013#50:1>
But the plant does not normally die.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-013#51:1>
Indeed such symptoms can sometimes be masked with more intensive
manuring and improvement of the soil.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-013#52:1>
Treated in this manner, the plants can still bear chilli fruits.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-013#53:1>
<h> 4 Harvesting </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2D-013#54:1>
The first green fruit can be harvested about 3 to 4 weeks from
flowering and if red chillies are preferred, the fruits will have to be left
to mature on the plants.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-013#55:1>
Chilli plants will continue to produce an abundance of fruits for a
period of 4 to 5 months if the are well maintained.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-013#56:1>
BlTTER GOURD Scientific Name: Momordica charantia L

<ICE-SIN:W2D-013#57:1>
<h> 1 Establishment of Plant </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2D-013#58:1>
As this plant is a climber, it needs space for its abundant vines to
trail healthily.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-013#59:1>
We should not grow more than two plants, otherwise they will be
difficult to manage.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-013#60:1>
It is suggested that 2 seeds be sowed at each end of the vegetable
bed.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-013#61:1>
This is done by digging a 3 cm hole in the soil with the fingers, and
covering the hole with the soil after dropping in the seed.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-013#62:1>
Remove 1 seedling if both seeds germinate at the two locations.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-013#63:1>
The seeds lie for about 7 to 8 days before germinating.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-013#64:1>
<h> 2 Management </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2D-013#65:1>
The vegetable bed should be watered once a day and the bed is to be
kept free of weeds.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-013#66:1>
Being climbing plants, they need the support of a netting.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-013#67:1>
A simple netting can be woven using ordinary raffia strings.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-013#68:1>
Mesh size can be about 10 cm by 10 cm.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-013#69:1>
One side of the netting can be tied onto a fence ( if there is one
adjacent to the planting bed) while the other can be supported by some wooden
slats.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-013#70:1>
The bitter gourd plants will send out their tendrils ( climbing
structures) when they are about 18 to 20 days old and the young climbers will
have to be guided up the netting with the aid of a small stick.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-013#71:1>
Lightly manure ( about 20 g per plant) the plants by broadcasting
some granular fertilizers to boost their growth.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-013#72:1>
The plants are fast growing and they will soon cover the netting.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-013#73:1>
Should the planting bed become compacted, lightly fork the soil,
especially around the collar of the plants.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-013#74:1>
The plants start to fruit about 45 to 50 days from the time of
sowing.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-013#75:1>
Continue manuring.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-013#76:1>
As the vines form a thick 'mat' on the netting, weeds are suppressed
due to the lack of sunlight.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-013#77:1>
Hence, there is really very little to do in maintaining this plant.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-013#78:1>
<h> 3 Pests and Diseases </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2D-013#79:1>
No serious pests and diseases are encountered except for some leaves
being chewed up by ladybird beetles.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-013#80:1>
These can be left without need of treatment as the damage is minimal.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-013#81:1>
The occasional snails do not attack this plant at all, probably
because the leaves may be too bitter!

<ICE-SIN:W2D-013#82:1>
<h> 4 Harvesting </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2D-013#83:1>
Many small gourds will appear at various axils ( where the leaves
branch out) along the vine.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-013#84:1>
As they grow, they will hang down below the netting.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-013#85:1>
It is indeed a beautiful sight to see the hanging gourds.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-013#86:1>
The gourds are ready for harvesting when they turn light green and by
this stage, the fruits may reach about 30 to 40 cm in length.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-013#87:1>
Two plants alone may yield some 25 gourds over a period of 6 to 8
weeks.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-013#88:1>
To protect the fruits from being damaged by fruit flies which lay
their eggs in the fruits, many growers do wrap their gourds with old
newspapers.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-013#89:1>
While this may be slightly tedious, it is a precaution worth taking.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-013#90:1>
The netting used for supporting the plants can be saved for
subsequent use when the harvest is over.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-013#91:1>
<h> 5 Some Common Beliefs </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2D-013#92:1>
Many people shy away from planting bitter gourd because they are of
the notion that subsequent crops of other vegetables grown in the same place
will be bitterish in taste.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-013#93:1>
This is absolutely untrue.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-013#94:1>
From my experience, lady's fingers planted after a bitter gourd crop
produce equally sweet and tender fruits.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-013#95:1>
IV) BACKYARD FRUITS

<ICE-SIN:W2D-013#96:1>
PAPAYA

<ICE-SIN:W2D-013#97:1>
Scientific name: Carica papaya L

<ICE-SIN:W2D-013#98:1>
Propagating Material: Seeds

<ICE-SIN:W2D-013#99:1>
<h> Establishment and Management </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2D-013#100:1>
The seedlings are normally grown in pots first.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-013#101:1>
When they are about 15 cm tall, they can then be transplanted into
your garden.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-013#102:1>
A planting hole about 1 m deep must be dug and backfilled with a
good quality top soil and compost mixture.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-013#103:1>
It would also be advantageous to add more of such soil mixture to
form a mound about 30 cm in height over the planting hole.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-013#104:1>
This is to encourage surface drainage as papaya plants do not thrive
in water-logged soil.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-013#105:1>
The seedlings should initially be manured with about 15 g of
fertilizer per plant once a month, and this should subsequently be increased
to about 30 g per plant monthly.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-013#106:1>
A precaution though; fertilizer granules should not be applied too
near to its tree trunk as it may cause the stem to rot.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-013#107:1>
A lot of variations do occur in papayas, hence seeds taken from a
sweet fruit do not guarantee offsprings that can bear equally sweet fruits.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-013#108:1>
LIME OR LIMAU ICASTURI

<ICE-SIN:W2D-013#109:1>
Scientific name: Citrus microcarpa Bange

<ICE-SIN:W2D-013#110:1>
Propagating Material: Stem

<ICE-SIN:W2D-013#111:1>
<h> Establishment and Management </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2D-013#112:1>
Good quality grafted saplings can be purchased from the Primary
Production Department's demonstration farm at Lim Chu Kang.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-013#113:1>
The sapling can be planted either in a dragon jar filled with good
quality soil/compost mixture or it can be planted in a prepared 1 m deep
planting hole.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-013#114:1>
The planting hole must then be backfilled with good quality soil/
compost mixture.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-013#115:1>
The sapling establishes itself rather fast and grafted ones normally
start to bear fruit early.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-013#116:1>
The plant must be frequently manured with about 20 g of fertilizer
once every 4 to 6 weeks to sustain its sturdy growth and a bountiful fruit
produce.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-013#117:1>
The plant is not susceptible to many pests or diseases, except the
occasional blackish appearance of sooty moulds.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-013#118:1>
Spraying with fungicides can prevent this problem.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-013#119:1>
A lime plant can be a good source of fresh lime juice, to quench
your thirst or to give flavour to a variety of food.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-013#120:1>
BANANA

<ICE-SIN:W2D-013#121:1>
Scientific name: Musa sp

<ICE-SIN:W2D-013#122:1>
Propagating Material: Suckers

<ICE-SIN:W2D-013#123:1>
<h> Establishment and Management </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2D-013#124:1>
Many varieties of bananas are available for planting.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-013#125:1>
The selection depends on your preference.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-013#126:1>
A sucker ( young soot growing from the base of a matured plant )
planted in a prepared 1 m planting hole can lead to the establishment of a
vigorous clump.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-013#127:1>
Banana plants grow better if the base is mulched with organic
materials.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-013#128:1>
Through a bi-monthly application of 30 to 40 g of fertilizer, the
colony of banana plants can produce bunches of bright yellow harvests in due
course.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-013#129:1>
For the clump to remain neat and aesthetically pleasing within the
home garden, all dry leaves should be removed. <X>

<ICE-SIN:W2D-013#X130:1>
A common pest found in our garden is the banana leaf-roller, which
is actually a caterpillar.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-013#X131:1>
These caterpillars can be easily handpicked and then discarded.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-013#X132:1>
One caution: bananas should not be planted on the same spot
continuously as they may attract the build-up of diseases such as the Panama
Disease. </X> </I>
