<ICE-SIN:S2A-056#1:1:A>
Okay

<ICE-SIN:S2A-056#2:1:A>
Welcome to all of you

<ICE-SIN:S2A-056#3:1:A>
Ah today I will exaggerate more on the PC side because now PC ah
become more and more popular

<ICE-SIN:S2A-056#4:1:A>
So of course <unclear> word </unclear> and we hope in Singapore ah
have a PC right so we will consider more of this

<ICE-SIN:S2A-056#5:1:A>
So introduction to the computer

<ICE-SIN:S2A-056#6:1:A>
Okay now to a computer I can see here

<ICE-SIN:S2A-056#7:1:A>
This is computer right

<ICE-SIN:S2A-056#8:1:A>
So this is not black box is a white box

<ICE-SIN:S2A-056#9:1:A>
Now for all those laymen not technical incline actually it's just a
magic black box

<ICE-SIN:S2A-056#10:1:A>
You put something in and something will come out right

<ICE-SIN:S2A-056#11:1:A>
You you press one key the picture will come out see

<ICE-SIN:S2A-056#12:1:A>
I I press a key here then another picture will come out right

<ICE-SIN:S2A-056#13:1:A>
It look very impressive <unclear> word </unclear> just like
magicians okay

<ICE-SIN:S2A-056#14:1:A>
So actually computer ah break down convert round the CPU

<ICE-SIN:S2A-056#15:1:A>
That's the most important thing

<ICE-SIN:S2A-056#16:1:A>
That is comparable to our brain

<ICE-SIN:S2A-056#17:1:A>
So so that is computer brain

<ICE-SIN:S2A-056#18:1:A>
It's a CPU and maybe consist of what you call ALU is Arithmetic and
Logic Unit

<ICE-SIN:S2A-056#19:1:A>
That means it can do Arithmetics and it can do some low level
logically <unclear> word </unclear> logical decision-making okay

<ICE-SIN:S2A-056#20:1:A>
Then <unclear> word </unclear> controller

<ICE-SIN:S2A-056#21:1:A>
Controller just like a traffic-controller

<ICE-SIN:S2A-056#22:1:A>
So if you want to read something from somewhere the controller will
advise the computer what to do so

<ICE-SIN:S2A-056#23:1:A>
If you want to read from floppy-disk it will read from floppy-disk

<ICE-SIN:S2A-056#24:1:A>
If you want to write to something some device it will write to some
other device

<ICE-SIN:S2A-056#25:1:A>
Whenever to show onto the screen it will show on the screen

<ICE-SIN:S2A-056#26:1:A>
So controller will do all the controlling

<ICE-SIN:S2A-056#27:1:A>
Now then the computer need what you call memory So when you go and
buy a computer for example if you ask how much memory you have right

<ICE-SIN:S2A-056#28:1:A>
So the basic configuration for example for eighty and 386 machine

<ICE-SIN:S2A-056#29:1:A>
For example the basic one will come up with about six hundred forty
K but some will come with one meg or even two meg or four meg

<ICE-SIN:S2A-056#30:1:A>
But whatever increase in the memory you'll have to pay for it

<ICE-SIN:S2A-056#31:1:A>
It's not free right

<ICE-SIN:S2A-056#32:1:A>
Now so we've the internal memory

<ICE-SIN:S2A-056#33:1:A>
The function of the controller is to retrive and store data
<unclear> word </unclear> from the storing devise

<ICE-SIN:S2A-056#34:1:A>
By storage devise for example here this one we have quite a number
of storage devises inside here We got hard disk in here we have a floppy-disk
in here

<ICE-SIN:S2A-056#35:1:A>
So this is a storage devise

<ICE-SIN:S2A-056#36:1:A>
So the controller will control all these things and it will
communicate between input and output devise

<ICE-SIN:S2A-056#37:1:A>
So this one is output devise

<ICE-SIN:S2A-056#38:1:A>
These two the keyboard and the mouse is input device okay so it
will control all the these function and it will communicate between the ALU
and memory

<ICE-SIN:S2A-056#39:1:A>
For example computer need to do some calculations they need
information

<ICE-SIN:S2A-056#40:1:A>
The information is stored in the memory

<ICE-SIN:S2A-056#41:1:A>
So the job of coordinating all these effort is done by ALU and
controller okay

<ICE-SIN:S2A-056#42:1:A>
Then you can execute instructions written in a programme so
computer will do a very fantastic job but one at a time

<ICE-SIN:S2A-056#43:1:A>
Now computer unlike human being <unclear> word </unclear>

<ICE-SIN:S2A-056#44:1:A>
My personal opinion computer can never replace human being because
no doubt we talk about computer intelligent artificial intelligent but
actually all those intelligent are human intelligent

<ICE-SIN:S2A-056#45:1:A>
Human put into the programmes so they become process of certain
degree of intelligent but it's all from human

<ICE-SIN:S2A-056#46:1:A>
So without man the computer cannot work right

<ICE-SIN:S2A-056#47:1:A>
Then the control of operation of ALU do all the arithmetic function
do logi logical decision-making So the function of ALE occurs as the name
imply it do arithmetic operations it perform logical operation for example by
logical operation means what

<ICE-SIN:S2A-056#48:1:A>
Suppose you are calculating say sales commission for example so if
you make monthly sales below five thousand no sales commission so it's zero
right so your commission will be zero

<ICE-SIN:S2A-056#49:1:A>
But if you make monthly sales between five thousand to ten thousand
commission will be 2% of the total sales for example

<ICE-SIN:S2A-056#50:1:A>
Then if your sales is for ten thousand to twenty commission will be
4% and so on

<ICE-SIN:S2A-056#51:1:A>
So the computer can make some logical decision-making So suppose it
make the sales for certain sales executive now it will know how to calculate
the sales commission If the sales' below five thousand the commission for
that month will be zero okay

<ICE-SIN:S2A-056#52:1:A>
If the sales is between five thousand and ten thousand computer are
smart enough they will take the total number of sales times 2% and then add
this one to your commission and so on

<ICE-SIN:S2A-056#53:1:A>
So that is what you call logic operations

<ICE-SIN:S2A-056#54:1:A>
Then the memory sometime you call this memory right

<ICE-SIN:S2A-056#55:1:A>
So you if there is time the computer programmes and then now
<unclear> word </unclear> it store Now computer actually is just a tool

<ICE-SIN:S2A-056#56:1:A>
Of course it's more uh what you call attractive and also more what
should be more flexible than just a knife for example

<ICE-SIN:S2A-056#57:1:A>
But in terms of utility it's just like a tool okay

<ICE-SIN:S2A-056#58:1:A>
Computer is a tool to help us to carry out our job more efficiently
in a more productive way so computer is a tool

<ICE-SIN:S2A-056#59:1:A>
Now how can a computer work without cannot work suppose computer
you buy a computer and you pay for say for example two thousand for a
computer you take it home you turn it on you'll <unclear> word </unclear> not
going to work because like if you don't pay for the software it doesn't work

<ICE-SIN:S2A-056#60:1:A>
It's just mere piece of hardware sit there and computer have a lot
of patience

<ICE-SIN:S2A-056#61:1:A>
If you don't tell the computer to do the cursor just hang on on the
screen that's all and it keep waiting to receive your instruction before you
make the first move

<ICE-SIN:S2A-056#62:1:A>
So all the computer do it so fantastic right is because of software

<ICE-SIN:S2A-056#63:1:A>
Now you watch for what you call Science fictions programme lah

<ICE-SIN:S2A-056#64:1:A>
I mean in TV right

<ICE-SIN:S2A-056#65:1:A>
So certain agent want to know other agent's information press one
button all biodatas everything come out right

<ICE-SIN:S2A-056#66:1:A>
Now the computer cannot do that all that is done by software and
also done by human being

<ICE-SIN:S2A-056#67:1:A>
That means in order to get all those information you must have the
information first so you may send twenty agents to get all the information

<ICE-SIN:S2A-056#68:1:A>
Then you need another number of peoples okay to key in all those
information and you need to have a software to retrieve all information and
show it on the screen to you right

<ICE-SIN:S2A-056#69:1:A>
So all these software programmes are stored in the memory

<ICE-SIN:S2A-056#70:1:A>
Now computer need to communicate with outside peripherals

<ICE-SIN:S2A-056#71:1:A>
For example you have input device for example the standard input
device is what you call keyboard okay and we have a mouse like that and
nowadays you have a new one call N system

<ICE-SIN:S2A-056#72:1:A>
Now if you don't want to key in you can just write you'll <unclear>
word </unclear> understand what you write okay

<ICE-SIN:S2A-056#73:1:A>
So that is input device

<ICE-SIN:S2A-056#74:1:A>
Then you have some output devices

<ICE-SIN:S2A-056#75:1:A>
This one is output device it's a standard one <unclear> word
</unclear>

<ICE-SIN:S2A-056#76:1:A>
So whatever you want to read come to here

<ICE-SIN:S2A-056#77:1:A>
Another device for example printer you can print it out

<ICE-SIN:S2A-056#78:1:A>
We'll cover the devices

<ICE-SIN:S2A-056#79:1:A>
So all these function will go through the CPU

<ICE-SIN:S2A-056#80:1:A>
CPU will do all the job right print something you want okay just
like your mother wants to cook certain dishes go to the market to buy all the
ingredients so ingredient is the input side and ingredient put in the input
device

<ICE-SIN:S2A-056#81:1:A>
Then the CPU that means already get the instruction how to cook say
for example sweet and sour pork for example

<ICE-SIN:S2A-056#82:1:A>
So with all our ingredient prepare then every single step will work
to carry out to cook sweet and sour pork <unclear> word </unclear> right

<ICE-SIN:S2A-056#83:1:A>
So output device will store your what dish We have some auxillary
storage for example you may have some other thick <unclear> word </unclear>
drive you may have

<ICE-SIN:S2A-056#84:1:A>
For example okay multi-media you may have CD-Rom everything you can
<unclear> word </unclear> to have all these

<ICE-SIN:S2A-056#85:1:A>
All went through the CPU

<ICE-SIN:S2A-056#86:1:A>
Now computer is a tool so what are the major characteristic of the
computer high-speed for example

<ICE-SIN:S2A-056#87:1:A>
Take for example you want to look for some information which
<unclear> word </unclear> on file then you see manually you go to the cabinet
look for the file keep flipping you still could find the information right

<ICE-SIN:S2A-056#88:1:A>
Right for computer system if you have a good database all I need to
do is key in the key words press a button you will immediately give off the
information from the devise okay

<ICE-SIN:S2A-056#89:1:A>
So for example nowaday you have an encyclopedia all on CD-Rom so
you can check all the reference ah articles by keying some of the key-words

<ICE-SIN:S2A-056#90:1:A>
You can immediately get the information out

<ICE-SIN:S2A-056#91:1:A>
Whereas for manual system you have all volumes of encyclopedia that
now you must know which volume to take out

<ICE-SIN:S2A-056#92:1:A>
Then you have to go to the index to check which page to look
<unclear> word </unclear> from

<ICE-SIN:S2A-056#93:1:A>
Now computer can do this in much much higher speed okay

<ICE-SIN:S2A-056#94:1:A>
Then it can systematically store and retrieve vast volume of datas
for example the bank auto-teller right you just if you put your card into the
ah auto-teller machine right

<ICE-SIN:S2A-056#95:1:A>
Then you just key in your what pin-number and then you key in what
you want to get out

<ICE-SIN:S2A-056#96:1:A>
All these in a few seconds' time you can get your money from the
bank already right

<ICE-SIN:S2A-056#97:1:A>
Why

<ICE-SIN:S2A-056#98:1:A>
Because the bank already systematically store the information in
there now

<ICE-SIN:S2A-056#99:1:A>
How much you've balance in there

<ICE-SIN:S2A-056#100:1:A>
So suppose you have only five hundred inside you key in eight
hundred it just simply say you have you have insufficient fund right please
take back your card suppose <unclear> word </unclear>

<ICE-SIN:S2A-056#101:1:A>
All the information is there so you can systematically store and
retrieve randomly all the information

<ICE-SIN:S2A-056#102:1:A>
You can automatically execute instruction

<ICE-SIN:S2A-056#103:1:A>
Now the first generation of computer is very terrible

<ICE-SIN:S2A-056#104:1:A>
It's all hard wire so they have to wire up wire up right to do one
operation they have to re-wire Change another operation

<ICE-SIN:S2A-056#105:1:A>
They have to re-wire all over again

<ICE-SIN:S2A-056#106:1:A>
So make that make the computer very unfriendly very hard to use
only those very few technical people know how to operate computers okay

<ICE-SIN:S2A-056#107:1:A>
But now the computer today is totally different

<ICE-SIN:S2A-056#108:1:A>
It's very friendly

<ICE-SIN:S2A-056#109:1:A>
All you need to do is just to the programme in store on any device

<ICE-SIN:S2A-056#110:1:A>
Then it can read from the device go into the memory and it just
carry out the instruction from the main menu

<ICE-SIN:S2A-056#111:1:A>
So it automatically carry out

<ICE-SIN:S2A-056#112:1:A>
Then it'll process logical capability

<ICE-SIN:S2A-056#113:1:A>
I already explain to you and it is accurate

<ICE-SIN:S2A-056#114:1:A>
Computer unless a computer go haywire okay it is more accurate
than you can expect

<ICE-SIN:S2A-056#115:1:A>
For example the computer will store up to fourteen decimals in
there okay

<ICE-SIN:S2A-056#116:1:A>
Right

<ICE-SIN:S2A-056#117:1:A>
As you've seen calculators sometime you have to do some rounding
and so if you have so many intermediate step the end result maybe <unclear>
word </unclear> rounding will cause you the first digit right

<ICE-SIN:S2A-056#118:1:A>
Difference okay

<ICE-SIN:S2A-056#119:1:A>
But computer is maintain full accuracy up to fourteen digit inside
and is reliable reliability

<ICE-SIN:S2A-056#120:1:A>
If the programme of course if the programme is wrong then of
course you couldn't rely on the computer to give you the result

<ICE-SIN:S2A-056#121:1:A>
But if the programme is correct the logic is correct then you key
in the information it can always reproduce it can reproduce the same result
over and over again

<ICE-SIN:S2A-056#122:1:A>
So ten persons key in the same thing running the same programme
will get the same result

<ICE-SIN:S2A-056#123:1:A>
You won't get different result okay

<ICE-SIN:S2A-056#124:1:A>
So that is reliable

<ICE-SIN:S2A-056#125:1:A>
So how does computer solve the problem as we mentioned in software
right

<ICE-SIN:S2A-056#126:1:A>
So for the computer software mainly is in two area one is system
software the other one is what you call application software

<ICE-SIN:S2A-056#127:1:A>
Now system software consist of control programme and service
programme

<ICE-SIN:S2A-056#128:1:A>
Now control programme will do all the necessary complication
between all the devices and between the memory

<ICE-SIN:S2A-056#129:1:A>
So if you want to open a data file say my grandparents they will
go to the appropriate device read the file out okay

<ICE-SIN:S2A-056#130:1:A>
So all these is done by control programme <X>

<ICE-SIN:S2A-056#X131:1:A>
All the input output side Then you have some call service
programme Now every now and then you need to copy file you need to backup
file for example you need to do purge purge all the file all these is come uh
under what you call service programme right </X> </I>
