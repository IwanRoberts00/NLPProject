<ICE-SIN:W2F-011#1:1>
<h> From London to Paris </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2F-011#2:1>
Railway stations had always intrigued Lienhwa.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-011#3:1>
To her, they meant freedom and were gateways to adventure.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-011#4:1>
But she was familiar with only the old Kowloon-Canton Railway station
in Hongkong with its familiar clock tower.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-011#5:1>
She'd often have tea in the cafe just inside the entrance, happy just
sitting there watching people spilling out of the trains that delivered them
from China.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-011#6:1>
It was always such a bustling scene.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-011#7:1>
Mothers with babies strapped on their backs, old ladies gamely
carrying bamboo baskets of live chickens and sweating coolies, with poles
across their bare, muscle-knotted shoulders, groaning under their heavy
loads.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-011#8:1>
Victoria Station at rush hour, on the other hand, throbbed with the
pulse of a night bazaar on a Chinese New Year's Eve, filled with the same
heaving mass of humanity.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-011#9:1>
Only the pace, smell and atmosphere differed.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-011#10:1>
Here, people muffled up in thick scarves and heavy coats rushed
along.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-011#11:1>
The tempo in an Eastern bazaar was much more leisurely.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-011#12:1>
The crowds simply ambled aimlessly and were, of course, more gaily
attired.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-011#13:1>
And instead of the pungent aromas she was accustomed to, Victoria
Station smelt musty and dank with the winter's chill.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-011#14:1>
Yet, not even the cold, grey, drabness could dampen her mounting
excitement.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-011#15:1>
Hurrying beside Jeremy, she felt the same pleasurable anticipation
she felt as a child, when, clinging to her father's hand, she had taken the
train to Penang, her first journey out of Singapore.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-011#16:1>
The trip had been her father's gift to her when she turned eight.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-011#17:1>
Now, thirteen years later, she was enjoying another birthday treat.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-011#18:1>
Only the destination this time wasn't some quiet seaside hamlet on
the coast of Malaya, but the sophisticated, glittering city of Paris.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-011#19:1>
And this time she was travelling with her lover, Jeremy Winthrop.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-011#20:1>
Jeremy's friends, Colonel Ken Pembridge, Captain Anthony James and
their wives, Susan and Bunty, were waiting for them on the platform.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-011#21:1>
All four had been at Lienhwa's twenty-first birthday celebration at
the Dorchester the previous night.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-011#22:1>
" I presume you had a good rest Jeremy?" queried Susan.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-011#23:1>
" I surely needed it," Jeremy laughed bashfully.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-011#24:1>
He turned to direct the porters who were loading all their
paraphernalia into a first-class compartment.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-011#25:1>
They were hardly installed in their seats, when Jeremy ordered a
couple of bottles of Chateau Margaux.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-011#26:1>
" To Paris," he toasted.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-011#27:1>
Everyone joined in, even Lienhwa.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-011#28:1>
Jeremy had insisted on initiating her into the pleasures of the
grape.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-011#29:1>
" It's time you learned to appreciate the finer things in life," he
declared.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-011#30:1>
Heady with happiness, Lienhwa obliged.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-011#31:1>
She was too excited to care.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-011#32:1>
In her new-found euphoria, she simply threw caution to the winds.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-011#33:1>
Snuggling close to Jeremy, she sipped eagerly at the glass of red
wine he handed her as she watched the countryside flashing by.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-011#34:1>
She was captivated by the fresh green meadows, the flocks of grazing
sheep and ewes frolicking in their midst.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-011#35:1>
Here and there, glimpses of well-fed cows and huge long-haired farm
horses and old stone cottages dotted a landscape that seemed to appear from
out of a fairytale.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-011#36:1>
The train entered a tunnel and out of the darkness there was a sudden
shriek from Bunty.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-011#37:1>
" Come on, Jeremy, now's the time."

<ICE-SIN:W2F-011#38:1>
Lienhwa felt Jeremy place a huge parcel on her lap.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-011#39:1>
" You'll need this," he said off-handedly.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-011#40:1>
Out into the light, Lienhwa saw the others watching her expectantly.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-011#41:1>
She undid the gift eagerly and was utterly dumbfounded at the sight
of the gleaming amber fur nestling within layers of soft, white tissues.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-011#42:1>
" Put it on and see if it fits," urged Bunty.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-011#43:1>
" I helped Jeremy choose it.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-011#44:1>
We spent ages hunting for the right one.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-011#45:1>
Jeremy wanted to get you a black diamond, but Jim at Calman Links
insisted it was too old for you." Helped by Jeremy, Lienhwa snuggled into the
luxurious warmth of the fur.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-011#46:1>
Then turning around, she impulsively flung her arms around him and
kissed him on the lips.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-011#47:1>
" Nothing like a mink coat to get a woman all worked up.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-011#48:1>
First lesson in seduction, right Jeremy?" Anthony said with dry
humour.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-011#49:1>
Lienhwa hastily detached herself from Jeremy's arms at Anthony's
remark.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-011#50:1>
What had come over her, she wondered?

<ICE-SIN:W2F-011#51:1>
Brought up the traditional way, she had it dinned into her since
childhood that one did not give way to demonstrations of affection,
particularly in public.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-011#52:1>
She adored her father, but would never have dreamt of kissing him.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-011#53:1>
Such a rash expression of feeling would have embarrassed him.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-011#54:1>
Her mother, stern and uptight, had never petted her; not even when
she'd been very ill with pneumonia.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-011#55:1>
Her old nurse, Ah Fong, had been the only person in Lienhwa's
childhood to offer some comfort.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-011#56:1>
Perhaps the wine coupled with the decadent lifestyle of Jeremy and
his friends were already beginning to have an effect upon her, Lienhwa
thought guiltily.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-011#57:1>
Her mother would be horrified if she could see her now.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-011#58:1>
In her opinion, no decent Chinese girl, and certainly not her
daughter, should even be seen in the company of a European man, let alone
travel around the world with one.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-011#59:1>
It was unthinkable.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-011#60:1>
As the merrymaking continued around her, Lienhwa's thoughts went back
to her abrupt departure from Hongkong only a few days previously.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-011#61:1>
Her family's shocked reaction was still fresh in her mind.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-011#62:1>
Her mother, prostrate with grief and anger, had from Singapore
telephoned Uncle Ping, with whom Lienhwa was staying.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-011#63:1>
She demanded that Uncle Ping take immediate action and stop Lienhwa
at all costs.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-011#64:1>
Uncle Ping in turn had remonstrated with Lienhwa.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-011#65:1>
" Think of the loss of face for your parents and the whole of the Liu
clan," he'd said sadly.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-011#66:1>
" Remember what Confucius said: 'One should think thrice before
making a move.' You'll live to regret this action." But Lienhwa had
stubbornly refused to heed her Uncle's counsel.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-011#67:1>
She craved freedom!

<ICE-SIN:W2F-011#68:1>
Lienhwa moved as if in a dream after they stepped out into the Gare
du Nord amidst clouds of steam hissing forth from the engines of the train.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-011#69:1>
Quickening her steps to keep in pace with Jeremy and the others, she
looked around the vast, gloomy station in hazy wonder, awed by the
strangeness of her surroundings.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-011#70:1>
" Allez, allez, la frite, la bonne frite!" Attracted by the raucous
sounds uttered in a language she couldn't understand, Lienhwa stared
curiously at the rough-looking man standing in a far corner, his arms filled
with paper bags of food.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-011#71:1>
He was clad in a pair of crude blue pants with matching jacket over a
thick grey woollen sweater.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-011#72:1>
On his head was a faded cap perched at a rakish angle.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-011#73:1>
A half-smoked cigarette trembled precariously at the corner of his
mouth as he shouted once again, " Allez, allez, la frite ..."

<ICE-SIN:W2F-011#74:1>
The strong smell of fried oil assailed her nostrils but, from the
distance, she couldn't quite make out what he was selling.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-011#75:1>
Following her gaze, Jeremy asked with an amused smile, " Would you
like a packet of French fries, darling?" Lienhwa shook her head, saying with
a laugh, " Is that what it is?"

<ICE-SIN:W2F-011#76:1>
They hurried on after removing their luggage, anxious to escape from
the heaving crowd.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-011#77:1>
Near the entrance of the station, Lienhwa clutched nervously at
Jeremy's arm as a couple of workmen lurched pass her on unsteady feet, their
breath heavy with the fumes of alcohol.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-011#78:1>
It was her first shock, and the chilly air did nothing to alleviate
the sense of insecurity she felt.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-011#79:1>
" See you both later at the Ritz," said Bunty with an airy wave of
her gloved hand.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-011#80:1>
They had separated at the taxi stand, Lienhwa and Jeremy sharing a
car on their own.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-011#81:1>
Once they were settled in the taxi, an overpowering scent assailed
Lienhwa's senses.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-011#82:1>
She wrinkled her nose.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-011#83:1>
" What kind of cigarettes do the French smoke, Jeremy?

<ICE-SIN:W2F-011#84:1>
They have such a powerful aroma."

<ICE-SIN:W2F-011#85:1>
" It's Gauloise.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-011#86:1>
Absinthe and Gauloise are two of the familiar smells of Paris,"
replied Jeremy.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-011#87:1>
As the taxi cruised along the bank of the Seine, Lienhwa looked out
of the window with rapt attention.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-011#88:1>
She marvelled at the architectural beauty of the buildings and sat
spellbound when the taxi entered Rue de la Paix.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-011#89:1>
Jeremy touched her lightly on the arm.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-011#90:1>
" Here's where some of the famous jewellers are.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-011#91:1>
Look, there's Cartier and Boucheron."

<ICE-SIN:W2F-011#92:1>
Minutes later, the taxi drew alongside the Ritz.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-011#93:1>
When they alighted from the car, Lienhwa looked around her with
wonder, impressed, like all tourists would be, by the imposing spiral bronze
column topped by the statue of Napoleon.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-011#94:1>
Lienhwa felt very small as she followed Jeremy and the porter, in his
white satin waistcoat and green breeches, down the long corridors of the vast
hotel which, with ageing grace, filled the entire block between the Place
Vendome and Rue Cambon.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-011#95:1>
The porter ushered them into their suite with grave dignity.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-011#96:1>
She was stunned by the rooms, although Jeremy moved around them as
though they belonged to him.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-011#97:1>
The enormous high-ceilinged sitting room was a delicate shade of
apricot, warmed by the crackling logs in the fireplace.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-011#98:1>
Intricate mouldings edged the ceiling, and delicate pieces of cream
and gold furniture were artfully arranged.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-011#99:1>
Crystal vases filled with long-stemmed white roses seemed to be on
every available surface.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-011#100:1>
" I ordered them specially for you ...white flowers for my little
virgin," Jeremy said, kissing her lightly on the tip of her nose.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-011#101:1>
He strolled across the room to a bottle of Dom Perignon buried in a
silver ice bucket.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-011#102:1>
Beside it was a box of bonbons, exquisitely wrapped with a cluster
of satin flowers on top.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-011#103:1>
" I need some refreshment," he said, expertly easing the cork out.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-011#104:1>
There was a quiet pop and hiss and the cork fell on the thick
silver-grey carpet.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-011#105:1>
Lienhwa felt worried.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-011#106:1>
She wished he wouldn't drink so heavily; he was so much nicer when
sober.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-011#107:1>
" Jeremy, why don't you wait a little while," she said.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-011#108:1>
" I'm parched and one simply can't drink water, it's poisonous!

<ICE-SIN:W2F-011#109:1>
Be a pet and keep me company, have a sip." Lienhwa gave a little
shudder.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-011#110:1>
" I'm still feeling the effects from all that drinking on the
train." " But darling, a tiny sip won't hurt," he said.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-011#111:1>
" Can't I have a bath first?

<ICE-SIN:W2F-011#112:1>
I want to freshen up." " Very well then."

<ICE-SIN:W2F-011#113:1>
The black marble bathroom was the most luxurious Lienhwa had ever
seen.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-011#114:1>
As she ran the bath she could hear Jeremy talking over the
telephone, making arrangements for the evening's entertainment.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-011#115:1>
She tested the temperature of the water with her toes and then
slipped into the scented froth with a sigh.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-011#116:1>
Eyes closed, she drifted into a half-slumber, wondering what Jeremy
was planning.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-011#117:1>
" Wake up darling, you'll catch your death of cold if you stay in
the water any longer." Jeremy was shaking her gently on the shoulder as he
handed her a glass of champagne.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-011#118:1>
She took a sip, made a grimace, and handed it back.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-011#119:1>
He turned on the tap, letting hot water gush into the bath,
temporarily misting the surrounding mirrors.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-011#120:1>
" Stand up darling, and let me soap you." He lathered her, his
fingers roving slowly over her body with the adroitness of a masseur's,
kneading and unknotting her muscles, bringing relief and pleasure.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-011#121:1>
Savouring every moment, Jeremy began teasing her clitoris,
masturbating her.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-011#122:1>
It brought back memories she had tried to repress, the times she'd
grip and rub a bolster between her legs to lull herself to sleep.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-011#123:1>
Her old nurse had caught her eventually, and threatened not only to
tell her mother but take her bolster away.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-011#124:1>
The thought of losing her precious bolster worried Lienhwa more than
the prospect of abandoning her bedtime game.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-011#125:1>
It was, to her, a sort of teddy bear and security blanket all rolled
into one.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-011#126:1>
She had buried the memory, but as Jeremy stood there looking at her
with a teasing look in his eyes, she turned crimson red at the thought, a
mixture of guilt and shame.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-011#127:1>
Scrambling out of the bath, she grabbed a towel from the rails and,
throwing it around herself, rushed out of the bathroom. <X>

<ICE-SIN:W2F-011#X128:1>
Jeremy suggested a nap after her bath as they were going to have a
long night ahead of them.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-011#X129:1>
When he tucked her in, he went into the sitting room and reclining
on the settee sipped his champagne.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-011#X130:1>
What a child she is, Jeremy thought but that's part of her charm.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-011#X131:1>
His mind roved back to the events of the night before and the
remembrance of how he'd behaved himself filled him with remorse and he felt
thoroughly ashamed of himself... </X> </I>
