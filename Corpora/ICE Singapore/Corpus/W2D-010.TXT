<ICE-SIN:W2D-010#3:1>
<h> Singapore : Strategic Economic Plan </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2D-010#4:1>
Judicious economic planning has characterised Singapore in its pursuit
of growth and excellence since it gained self-government in 1959.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-010#5:1>
The plans set the priorities right by focusing on critical areas at
each phase of economic development These have progressively transformed the
country from an entrepot economy into a global city with capabilities in high
value-added manufacturing and services industries.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-010#6:1>
The First Economic Plan, launched in 1960, concentrated on job
creation through industrialisation and the promotion of labour-intensive
industries.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-010#7:1>
The Second Economic Plan, developed in 1980, focused on raising
productivity to maintain Singapore's competitiveness, and on increasing the
pool of professional and technical manpower needed by industries.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-010#8:1>
In 1985, the Ministry of Trade and Industry's Economic Planning
Committee prepared the Third Economic Plan.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-010#9:1>
The main thrust was to sharpen Singapore's competitive edge for
sustained economic growth.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-010#10:1>
Measures such as a flexible wage system and the promotion of the
services sector were recommended.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-010#11:1>
All three economic plans were highly effective in achieving their
primary aims.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-010#12:1>
<h> Vision For The 21st Century </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2D-010#13:1>
In its continuing pursuit of growth and excellence, Singapore now
intends to attain the status and characteristics of a first league developed
country within the next 30 to 40 years.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-010#14:1>
These characteristics include economic dynamism and a high quality of
life.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-010#15:1>
The aspirations and the strategies for achieving the the goal are
contained in the Strategic Economic Plan developed in 1991 by the Ministry's
Economic Planning Committee.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-010#16:1>
<h> Strategic Thrusts </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2D-010#17:1>
Singapore has identified eight strategic thrusts for long term
economic growth.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-010#18:1>
These are: Enhancing human resources.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-010#19:1>
Under this programme, Singapore will increase the supply of the top
echelon of talented and professional people.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-010#20:1>
This will ensure investors of an adequate pool of human resources to
meet their needs.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-010#21:1>
The new International Manpower Programme will attract more
international talent to work in Singapore.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-010#22:1>
Promoting national teamwork.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-010#23:1>
Channels will be opened for business, labour and government to work
together for better national performance.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-010#24:1>
At the higher level, an Economic Panel chaired by the Minister for
Trade and Industry, with representatives from the public and private sectors
will discuss major economic issues of the key groups of the economy.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-010#25:1>
At the other level will be sectoral conferences to create a broader
understanding within each sector of different perspectives and positions.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-010#26:1>
Such channels will provide investors with the opportunity to discuss
other economic issues which have an impact on economic performance in the
medium- to long-term.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-010#27:1>
Becoming internationally oriented.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-010#28:1>
For the past 30 years, Singapore's success has been based on tapping
world markets and global companies.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-010#29:1>
In the next lap of economic development, the country will go beyond
this by tapping global resources, technology and talent.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-010#30:1>
To achieve this objective Singapore will build up its capabilities in
both hard and soft infrastructure.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-010#31:1>
Companies will be encouraged to operate globally, investing in
projects that can generate economic spin-offs to Singapore.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-010#32:1>
Creating a conducive climate for innovation.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-010#33:1>
The government will encourage companies and individuals to adopt
innovative ideas to increase business efficiency.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-010#34:1>
Special precincts/districts such as the Science Park and the
Technology Corridor are available to provide a conducive and intellectual
environment.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-010#35:1>
Facilities for R&D work will be expanded.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-010#36:1>
Developing manufacturing and service clusters.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-010#37:1>
The development of the core abilities of each cluster will have the
advantage of greater economies of scale and hence, more resilience to market
conditions which may affect a particular industry.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-010#38:1>
Fourteen clusters have been identified.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-010#39:1>
These include precision engineering, electronics, information
technology, petroleum and petrochemical, heavy engineering, general
supporting industries and international hub.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-010#40:1>
A plan for each cluster will be formulated, in consultation with
industry and the relevant government agencies.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-010#41:1>
Spearheading economic redevelopment.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-010#42:1>
Domestic industries and businesses will be modernised, upgraded and
made more efficient to maximise their potential and enhance Singapore's
economic dynamism.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-010#43:1>
Local companies are encouraged to form strategic alliances to benefit
from the economies of scale and management expertise.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-010#44:1>
Maintaining international competitiveness.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-010#45:1>
To ensure that Singapore remains an attractive business location in
the Asia Pacific, information on short- to long-term competitiveness
indicators will be compiled.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-010#46:1>
A working group with representatives from the Ministry of Trade and
Industry, the Monetary Authority of Singapore and the Economic Development
Board ( EDB) will regularly review information on trends in competitiveness
and make appropriate recommendations.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-010#47:1>
Reducing vulnerability.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-010#48:1>
This programme is to ensure a stable climate for companies to operate
in.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-010#49:1>
The MNCs will be encouraged to use Singapore as a home base, rather
than just a business location, which is convenient and profitable in the
short term.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-010#50:1>
Local enterprises will be encouraged to develop to world-class
standards and provide a strong support base for the MNCs.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-010#51:1>
<h> IMPLEMENTATION OF THE SEP </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2D-010#52:1>
Singapore's past economic development strategies have stood the test
of time.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-010#53:1>
The new strategies and initiatives in the SEP will guide the Republic
through today's increasingly complex and competitive world business
environment to its vision of tomorrow.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-010#54:1>
In its implementation, the Plan will be flexible and will be modified
in accordance with the needs of prevailing economic situations.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-010#55:1>
Strategic partnerships between companies and between countries are
becoming a global imperative in the advent of a " borderless" world.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-010#56:1>
These alliances, which harness their complementary strengths in a
wide spectrum of business activities, enable companies and countries to
collaborate for mutual benefit and for collective competitiveness.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-010#57:1>
As the Asia-Pacific home of over 3,000 multinational companies (
MNCs), of which 700 are in manufacturing, Singapore has forged strategic
alliances with MNCs seeking business expansion in the region.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-010#58:1>
In its role as a global business architect, the Republic helps them
plan their strategies to reconfigure and distribute their activities which
will capitalise business opportunities here.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-010#59:1>
<h> INTERNATIONAL BUSlNESS LINKAGES </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2D-010#60:1>
Singapore has widened its international business linkages.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-010#61:1>
Strategic partnerships have been forged with several countries,
including the United Kingdom, France and Hong Kong under a" Globalisation
through Twinning" concept.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-010#62:1>
Companies in these countries are encouraged to identify specific
business opportunities which will bring mutual benefits to both parties.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-010#63:1>
These initiatives have opened the way for more business collaboration
between companies in Singapore and in these economies, through cross
investments and other activities.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-010#64:1>
Through its International Business Development Programme, the EDB
will facilitate overseas investment by Singapore companies for access to
technology, markets and resources.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-010#65:1>
The initiative has resulted in a number of companies setting up
businesses overseas in the United States, Europe and Asia.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-010#66:1>
<h> REGIONAL BUSINESS LINKAGES </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2D-010#67:1>
Similar business linkages have been formed in Asia.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-010#68:1>
The most significant is the economic arrangement among Singapore, the
Riau islands in Indonesia and Johor in Malaysia.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-010#69:1>
The rationale behind the move is to build on the complementary
strengths and capabilities of the three economies to provide the energy for
faster growth.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-010#70:1>
Within this Growth Triangle, investors can obtain the entire mix of
resources such as sophisticated infrastructure, management and technical
expertise, labour and land to meet the requirements for expanding their
regional distributed activities.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-010#71:1>
Efforts to develop investment in projects utilising the complementary
advantages of the three regions are making good progress.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-010#72:1>
<h> TOTAL BUSIIIESS CAPABILITIES </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2D-010#73:1>
One of Singapore's competitive strength in its total business
capabilities in manufacturing and services, the twin engines of growth.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-010#74:1>
Leading LNCs have expanded and diversified their spectrum of
activities here to include manufacturing, marketing, international
procurement, R&D, technical support, training, fund management and other
services.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-010#75:1>
The state-of-the-art technologies and expertise brought in by them
have heightened local competence and contributed to making the Republic an
international total business centre.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-010#76:1>
For the next phase of economic growth, Singapore will enhance its
industrial and technology base through greater focus on research and
development ( R&D ) in niche areas.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-010#77:1>
Working in partnership with international leaders in industry and
technology, the Republic will build up its research, development and design
capabilities in these areas.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-010#78:1>
The process has already begun.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-010#79:1>
Targets set up under the five year R & D blueprint ( the S&dollar;2 billion
National Technology Plan) are for total national R&D expenditure to reach 2%
of the GDP by 1995 ( a minimum 50% private sector share of this total), and a
ratio of the number of scientists and engineers engaged in R&D activities of
40 per 10,000 labour force by 1995.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-010#80:1>
" The whole naion spells efficiency, productivity and reliability."
Mr John Fitzgerald, Vice President for the Asia-Pacific, United Parcel
Service.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-010#81:1>
The start of R&D in advanced microelectronic engineering at the new
SS30 million Institute of Microelectronics ( IME) is a crucial step forward
in the upgrading of the semiconductor industry in new areas such as
sophisticated diagnostic tools, sub-micron IC technologies, advanced mixed
signal IC design and design methodology.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-010#82:1>
To further boost R&D activities in Singapore, three private and three
public organisations ( IBM Singapore is the largest shareholder in the joint
venture) have set up a S&dollar;5 million commercial laboratory to conduct advanced
IT ( Information Technology) R&D and leading edge solutions for the local and
international markets.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-010#83:1>
Since it started its economic development programme over 30 years
ago, Singapore has upheld its open-door policy.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-010#84:1>
The policy allows 100 % foreign ownership of companies, employment of
foreign labour, tax-free imports and exports of raw materials, equipment and
products, free movement of capital and repatriation of profits.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-010#85:1>
This pro-business attitude makes it easy for companies to start and
do business here.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-010#86:1>
The Government's pragmatic leadership has ensured political
stability.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-010#87:1>
In addition, the harmonious tripartite relationship between
government, labour and employers has resulted in an enduring industrial
peace.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-010#88:1>
Under this conducive operating environment, companies are free to
focus their attention on their business and implement their strategies
without fear of disruption.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-010#89:1>
Support for business is also reflected in the close co ordination
among the government agencies in Singapore to meet the needs of global
companies.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-010#90:1>

terms of services and are serving the needs of all types of businesses.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-010#100:1>
Singapore's continuous investments to upgrade its infrastructure
will ensure that its facilities and services meet the changing and
sophisticated requirements of businesses operating here.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-010#101:1>
Business parks are being developed to meet the needs of modern
businesses and high-technology industries setting up in Singapore.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-010#102:1>
These international business parks allow companies to integrate and
carry out their full range of activities including manufacturing, R&D and
training, in one location.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-010#103:1>
Singapore will continue to invest heavily in manpower development to
enhance the quality of the labour force, rated the best in the world by
international risk analysis firm, Business Environment Risk Intelligence (
BERI) for more than a decade.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-010#104:1>
In its L992 Labour Force Evaluation Measure, BERI reported that
Singapore's GDP per hour per worker of about US&dollar; 12 and wages averaging
US&dollar;3.20 per hour yield the world's highest relative productivity ratio.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-010#105:1>
The number of engineers available for industries here is growing.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-010#106:1>
