<ICE-SIN:S2A-043#1:1:A>
They are all R and D people

<ICE-SIN:S2A-043#2:1:A>
They take the plunge and they make it

<ICE-SIN:S2A-043#3:1:A>
The world is fuming <unclear> word </unclear> around R and D people

<ICE-SIN:S2A-043#4:1:A>
There's no kidding right and uh this man from uh I think he's uh the
chairman of a Matsushita or something like that

<ICE-SIN:S2A-043#5:1:A>
He says that the creation of product leads to the creation of wealth

<ICE-SIN:S2A-043#6:1:A>
So as far as these people you are one of a pillars of success

<ICE-SIN:S2A-043#7:1:A>
There are three pillars products marketing and finance

<ICE-SIN:S2A-043#8:1:A>
So you have no money you have no market institute go for R and D

<ICE-SIN:S2A-043#9:1:A>
Right that's how I got started

<ICE-SIN:S2A-043#10:1:A>
Okay I I'm going to scrap through uh you know we might as well tell
you how I got started in R and D

<ICE-SIN:S2A-043#11:1:A>
It's just like telling a story you know but uh maybe I just briefly
run through it and uh and uh see whether the you know you will get inspired

<ICE-SIN:S2A-043#12:1:A>
First of all I believe I am a inquisitive person very curious

<ICE-SIN:S2A-043#13:1:A>
I refuse to accept what someone tells me until I try out myself
okay and I think that is one quality I believe in a R and D person

<ICE-SIN:S2A-043#14:1:A>
If you were to accept anything somebody tells you then I think you
are a forward not a innovative not a leader

<ICE-SIN:S2A-043#15:1:A>
In order to be number one you have to lead

<ICE-SIN:S2A-043#16:1:A>
You have to come with ideas

<ICE-SIN:S2A-043#17:1:A>
You can't just accept okay

<ICE-SIN:S2A-043#18:1:A>
So back in school I remember one uh one project that I I did how to
how to build a a high voltage converter

<ICE-SIN:S2A-043#19:1:A>
I know nothing about electronics okay so I had a little magazine
that says how you can you can solve or generate a high voltage

<ICE-SIN:S2A-043#20:1:A>
And uh it was like uh using a nail and you will have a front-wire
and with your next <unclear> word </unclear> break switch in a battery

<ICE-SIN:S2A-043#21:1:A>
On outside you have secondary coil so in same place you will
connect all this together and put the switch on and off you will generate a
high voltage

<ICE-SIN:S2A-043#22:1:A>
Actually it works but to implement that was difficult

<ICE-SIN:S2A-043#23:1:A>
So how will you go about implementing such a a a idea into a pro a
local product

<ICE-SIN:S2A-043#24:1:A>
So what I did was I took a bell you know electric bell take out
external wire and wire another coil on the other side

<ICE-SIN:S2A-043#25:1:A>
It generates a high voltage a couple of hundred volts and I what I
did was I took a bolt and put that into a into the hollow output put a
metallic meta uh foil on it connect the two wires to it

<ICE-SIN:S2A-043#26:1:A>
I had a lot of Playboy magazines uh photograph on top stick it on
and plug the bolt in my friends

<ICE-SIN:S2A-043#27:1:A>
So when they open the bolt they got a very shock of their life

<ICE-SIN:S2A-043#28:1:A>
So this is some things that I uh did and there's <unclear> word
</unclear> R and D

<ICE-SIN:S2A-043#29:1:A>
The interest in uh wanting to create product okay

<ICE-SIN:S2A-043#30:1:A>
So apparently there's a when I rave on R and D was my my lecturer
in the universities got me a job in the summer vacation help him to build up
uh certain uh you products that he was doing

<ICE-SIN:S2A-043#31:1:A>
I got stuck was interesting you know

<ICE-SIN:S2A-043#32:1:A>
Uh I couldn't sleep I was trying to to you know figure out one day
or come back to work on Mondays

<ICE-SIN:S2A-043#33:1:A>
You are crazy you know

<ICE-SIN:S2A-043#34:1:A>
So if you want to do R and D do you have this in you

<ICE-SIN:S2A-043#35:1:A>
This is not it's not a nine-to-five job it's nine to three a m

<ICE-SIN:S2A-043#36:1:A>
Sometimes okay so don't tell me I have to go home to have dinner
with my mummy or with my girlfriends or boyfriends

<ICE-SIN:S2A-043#37:1:A>
Forget it and if for three years if you want to be really good
forget about all these social dates

<ICE-SIN:S2A-043#38:1:A>
Just look at Mister Sim Mister Sim of Creative Technology he's
still a

<ICE-SIN:S2A-043#39:1:A>
I'm sorry I but I guess so he's got no time from girlfriends

<ICE-SIN:S2A-043#40:1:A>
But he's such he's on the extreme side okay

<ICE-SIN:S2A-043#41:1:A>
He's very wealthy so you don't have to be so wealthy you still can
have girlfriends and boyfriends you know

<ICE-SIN:S2A-043#42:1:A>
So if you were to ask me why I go into R and D I'll give you two
answers

<ICE-SIN:S2A-043#43:1:A>
Fore thing first of all I will say because of interest of an ideal
of a dream you know that like you fresh out of university

<ICE-SIN:S2A-043#44:1:A>
I think I know everything you know and go in blow a lot of chips
you know come as a you know

<ICE-SIN:S2A-043#45:1:A>
You expect the the wires to be zero resistance it's not

<ICE-SIN:S2A-043#46:1:A>
You know you think that you can run a a higher crazy uh stuff on
the long wires you you fail miserably <unclear> word </unclear> you know

<ICE-SIN:S2A-043#47:1:A>
So there are two answers

<ICE-SIN:S2A-043#48:1:A>
Now I'll say after fourteen years of doing R and D I would go to R
and D because it give you the opportunity to be your own boss

<ICE-SIN:S2A-043#49:1:A>
With that knowledge in you you see I will tell if you leave during
this university now or junior colleges now you go out to work two years later
everything is gone

<ICE-SIN:S2A-043#50:1:A>
You'll only retain between three to five per cent of what you're
taught

<ICE-SIN:S2A-043#51:1:A>
You'll only remember we <unclear> word </unclear> is to I <unclear>
word </unclear> tower <unclear> word </unclear> I <unclear> word </unclear>
saw <unclear> word </unclear>

<ICE-SIN:S2A-043#52:1:A>
Everything else what accounts extrapolation all secondary all given
back to your lecturer

<ICE-SIN:S2A-043#53:1:A>
You don't need that anymore

<ICE-SIN:S2A-043#54:1:A>
It's all gut feel

<ICE-SIN:S2A-043#55:1:A>
You touch the a board you suppose to know where the the the the
board is like a doctor you know

<ICE-SIN:S2A-043#56:1:A>
Let's say I think you've got a slight fever you know something like
that

<ICE-SIN:S2A-043#57:1:A>
Okay this is all gut feel okay

<ICE-SIN:S2A-043#58:1:A>
After a while experience comes in

<ICE-SIN:S2A-043#59:1:A>
You look at the board you're <unclear> word </unclear> is on the
line you have ground problems

<ICE-SIN:S2A-043#60:1:A>
The textbook never teach you

<ICE-SIN:S2A-043#61:1:A>
It's all hard work

<ICE-SIN:S2A-043#62:1:A>
Someone one says successful product of man is ninety-nine per cent
perspiration one per cent inspiration okay

<ICE-SIN:S2A-043#63:1:A>
So you finish nine per cent very fast the ten per cent take you
ninety per cent all the time

<ICE-SIN:S2A-043#64:1:A>
So the reason why I would like to see more of you guys go into R
and D is because it gives you the opportunity uh to first go into any area
you want right

<ICE-SIN:S2A-043#65:1:A>
From R and D you can go into marketing

<ICE-SIN:S2A-043#66:1:A>
You make a super marketing man

<ICE-SIN:S2A-043#67:1:A>
Why

<ICE-SIN:S2A-043#68:1:A>
Because you know how to use a soak <unclear> word </unclear> better
than anybody else

<ICE-SIN:S2A-043#69:1:A>
If you have not done R and D first you go into sales you try to use
a soak in front of a customer you can't even trigger it

<ICE-SIN:S2A-043#70:1:A>
You think how your customer feels right

<ICE-SIN:S2A-043#71:1:A>
It's that's a fact

<ICE-SIN:S2A-043#72:1:A>
So you think that unless you go into say sales three years' later
become a manager

<ICE-SIN:S2A-043#73:1:A>
By the time you have given back everything to your lecturer you are
just like any other person

<ICE-SIN:S2A-043#74:1:A>
Can be a a accounts student or business student vying for the same
job

<ICE-SIN:S2A-043#75:1:A>
Where is your competitive edge

<ICE-SIN:S2A-043#76:1:A>
You have no compete you have no advantage

<ICE-SIN:S2A-043#77:1:A>
The only way to stay a to stay ahead is to have that niche a
competitive edge

<ICE-SIN:S2A-043#78:1:A>
That's a fact right

<ICE-SIN:S2A-043#79:1:A>
If everybody were to say so you want two thousand dollars give him
one two thousand dollars

<ICE-SIN:S2A-043#80:1:A>
How can I provide one thousand dollars

<ICE-SIN:S2A-043#81:1:A>
So if do R and D you specialise three years later your foundation
is laid

<ICE-SIN:S2A-043#82:1:A>
You can go to sales if you are still good carry on R and D

<ICE-SIN:S2A-043#83:1:A>
After five years you've got a lot products hiding in your mind go
and see a banker or investor and say I'll like to start a company with you
and for my share what I do

<ICE-SIN:S2A-043#84:1:A>
You put ninety per per cent of the money you give ten per cent of
the share free I still get my salary

<ICE-SIN:S2A-043#85:1:A>
And that's it that's how you get started without any money

<ICE-SIN:S2A-043#86:1:A>
No that's a fact You ask Mister Sim how he get started

<ICE-SIN:S2A-043#87:1:A>
His father runs a grocery shop alright

<ICE-SIN:S2A-043#88:1:A>
Not many of us have rich fathers alright

<ICE-SIN:S2A-043#89:1:A>
So let's say you don't go into R and D that's why I have to go away
from my my my my regret

<ICE-SIN:S2A-043#90:1:A>
Uh I guess it's fine now

<ICE-SIN:S2A-043#91:1:A>
Let's say you don't go into R and D okay

<ICE-SIN:S2A-043#92:1:A>
You spend three years you become five years you'll become a manager

<ICE-SIN:S2A-043#93:1:A>
By the time you reach thirty your lifestyle goes up

<ICE-SIN:S2A-043#94:1:A>
Hit thirty-five director of company appointed the the G M or
director of company

<ICE-SIN:S2A-043#95:1:A>
By the time you reach forty you're a heavy weight earning twelve
thousand fifteen thousand a month

<ICE-SIN:S2A-043#96:1:A>
What have you got

<ICE-SIN:S2A-043#97:1:A>
Nothing basically

<ICE-SIN:S2A-043#98:1:A>
All you have is your P R

<ICE-SIN:S2A-043#99:1:A>
When recession comes who do you think the boss will sack first

<ICE-SIN:S2A-043#100:1:A>
Not if you remember nineteen eight-five eighty-six when recession
comes right

<ICE-SIN:S2A-043#101:1:A>
I believe many there are many of you who have parents who may have
lost the job

<ICE-SIN:S2A-043#102:1:A>
You will realise that that's all

<ICE-SIN:S2A-043#103:1:A>
Why don't you have the <unclear> word </unclear> <unclear> word
</unclear> don't <unclear> word </unclear> <unclear> word </unclear>

<ICE-SIN:S2A-043#104:1:A>
Forget about being kiasu

<ICE-SIN:S2A-043#105:1:A>
Go for the try

<ICE-SIN:S2A-043#106:1:A>
What's what's the problem

<ICE-SIN:S2A-043#107:1:A>
Your five three to five years you fail go and get a job

<ICE-SIN:S2A-043#108:1:A>
What's wrong

<ICE-SIN:S2A-043#109:1:A>
But what you've learnt in R and D is yours

<ICE-SIN:S2A-043#110:1:A>
Nobody will take it from you

<ICE-SIN:S2A-043#111:1:A>
It's your asset

<ICE-SIN:S2A-043#112:1:A>
That's what you need

<ICE-SIN:S2A-043#113:1:A>
After all you know in my my father gave me my education and I
somehow I landed in Singapore because of girl

<ICE-SIN:S2A-043#114:1:A>
And uh later on I ended up a Malaysian boy in Singapore went into
R and D fumble around here and there

<ICE-SIN:S2A-043#115:1:A>
And uh with all this knowledge I met a investor

<ICE-SIN:S2A-043#116:1:A>
So I told him an an idea

<ICE-SIN:S2A-043#117:1:A>
Basically how we got started was this

<ICE-SIN:S2A-043#118:1:A>
I was running an engineering firm repairing IBM P C's uh AO
general data general mainframes and uh that sort

<ICE-SIN:S2A-043#119:1:A>
So we're having problems trying to repair all this computers

<ICE-SIN:S2A-043#120:1:A>
What we buy in the market is scopes a uh something called huntrump
<unclear> word </unclear> tractor

<ICE-SIN:S2A-043#121:1:A>
That's a V I trace you know

<ICE-SIN:S2A-043#122:1:A>
And we have hundreds of boards every month

<ICE-SIN:S2A-043#123:1:A>
And we got to send the board to the US and that time a PCXT causes
one thousand five hundred bucks per board

<ICE-SIN:S2A-043#124:1:A>
And you got to pay forty per cent to send it back to the US

<ICE-SIN:S2A-043#125:1:A>
And it takes you three months to get it back where in Singapore I
got to replace the customer immediately

<ICE-SIN:S2A-043#126:1:A>
So how do you run a company like this

<ICE-SIN:S2A-043#127:1:A>
And there's no products in the market that can help us to do that

<ICE-SIN:S2A-043#128:1:A>
So with that kind of problem I got my chief engineer to go out and
start the company making test equipment that will solve this type of problem

<ICE-SIN:S2A-043#129:1:A>
So we got an investor to back us up and we started with a ten
square feet room three person

<ICE-SIN:S2A-043#130:1:A>
That other person employed engineer left us after one month
because he felt that we have no prospect

<ICE-SIN:S2A-043#131:1:A>
So left two of us

<ICE-SIN:S2A-043#132:1:A>
So everything was handmade we called it Rolls Royce alright
everything was hand hand-wired handmade

<ICE-SIN:S2A-043#133:1:A>
I still have all this in my office you know

<ICE-SIN:S2A-043#134:1:A>
I can show you very proudly all hand-wired

<ICE-SIN:S2A-043#135:1:A>
But we did have a product

<ICE-SIN:S2A-043#136:1:A>
We got to the product was called Supercat

<ICE-SIN:S2A-043#137:1:A>
Super because it was super product cat because it was uh
computer-aided tested

<ICE-SIN:S2A-043#138:1:A>
So we sold that we sold the product and uh the company running for
a million dollars to an Australian office

<ICE-SIN:S2A-043#139:1:A>
We made some money and not a lot and because we we didn't have the
capital so the ninety per cent belongs to the investor

<ICE-SIN:S2A-043#140:1:A>
So we started another company and this time we were at thinking of
a new product what could come out after Supercat

<ICE-SIN:S2A-043#141:1:A>
You see at that you we had no focus you say what is life after
Supercat

<ICE-SIN:S2A-043#142:1:A>
After producing the product you know like your Lexus what is life
after lexus <X>

<ICE-SIN:S2A-043#X143:1:A>
You know you know that kind of feel </X> </I>
