<I>

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-076#1:1:A>
It was fun right Doctor Low's I mean uhm Miss Low's

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-076#2:1:B>
Mrs Low's class

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-076#3:1:A>
Mrs Low's class yes yes

<ICE-SIN:S1A-076#4:1:A>
I I really miss the you know her uhm her style of teaching

<ICE-SIN:S1A-076#5:1:A>
I really enjoy her tutorials so much you know and together with Pee
Za we had so much fun then uhm and Siang Ling also

<ICE-SIN:S1A-076#6:1:A>
We used to be uhm actually I I we knew her style is uhm you know she
actually wanted to separate us you see

<ICE-SIN:S1A-076#7:1:A>
So we tried to stick together

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-076#8:1:B>
Oh yah I guess it's more comfortable with people you know but I
I like the classes because she tries to give an example of what she wants us
to be when actually teaching

<ICE-SIN:S1A-076#9:1:B>
Not like the others because I find some of them do uhm fail to
practise what they preach

<ICE-SIN:S1A-076#10:1:B>
Ah well with all due respect to them

<ICE-SIN:S1A-076#11:1:B>
But somehow I wish those those lecturers in N U S went through this
course

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-076#12:1:A>
Ah yes

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-076#13:1:B>
Because I I think there're a lot of mechanics they ought to
know right how to uhm manage the O H T uhm a lot of other classroom mechanics
which I thought would be helpful to them because now I'm looking back I felt
find a lot of lecturers and tutors don't really know how to control a class
and how to read the faces of pupils of of the students in in university

<ICE-SIN:S1A-076#14:1:B>
Because sometimes I just don't understand a lesson and I find uhm
I'm really communicating with the tutor

<ICE-SIN:S1A-076#15:1:B>
You know he's supposed to make sure I understand my work

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-076#16:1:A>
Oh yah

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-076#17:1:B>
So I find uhm N U S tutors senior tutors and lecturers should
undergo some form of training to prepare them to impart their knowledge but
not just go straight into it after their qualifications or whatever

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-076#18:1:A>
Oh yes I think now they might have this course going on
because that day I I was in the library N I E library

<ICE-SIN:S1A-076#19:1:A>
Then I saw this publication you know that says uh they have
actually trained uh uh trained a batch of N U S lecturers and the poly the
poly one polytechnic lecturers to undergo this course

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-076#20:1:B>
And to go back and then and share what they've learnt

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-076#21:1:A>
Uh well it's course on uhm teaching them uhm you know teaching
techniques or lecturing techniques

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-076#22:1:B>
I see I see oh I'm worried about that

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-076#23:1:A>
Yah it's a kind of a small group uh

<ICE-SIN:S1A-076#24:1:A>
I think probably only those new newer ones will get to try

<ICE-SIN:S1A-076#25:1:A>
Probably the more senior ones maybe they

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-076#26:1:B>
Yah it won't be very nice to get them <unclear> word
</unclear>

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-076#27:1:A>
So I think they're having it currently

<ICE-SIN:S1A-076#28:1:A>
But you you'd be surprise

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-076#29:1:B>
But I still don't think that's enough

<ICE-SIN:S1A-076#30:1:B>
I I find everybody has to go through it not just uhm a selected few

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-076#31:1:A>
Oh yah I think so too

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-076#32:1:B>
Well anyway

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-076#33:1:A>
Probably they will would have spared us all the lessons you
know always of uh trying to find out what they're uh saying

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-076#34:1:B>
Yah anyhow but I'm enjoying this course so far lah

<ICE-SIN:S1A-076#35:1:B>
How about yourself

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-076#36:1:A>
Yah I'm enjoying myself but then

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-076#37:1:B>
Not that not that I'm learning a lot

<ICE-SIN:S1A-076#38:1:B>
It's like sometimes I I just sit through it for the sake of sitting
through it but on ocassionally I think about a quarter out of all times I do
find I learn something new

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-076#39:1:A>
Yes yes yes

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-076#40:1:B>
A technique that I can uhm you know

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-076#41:1:A>
Use

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-076#42:1:B>
Share

<ICE-SIN:S1A-076#43:1:B>
Uh something wholesome

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-076#44:1:A>
Yes but I actually personally speaking I prefer that uh that
small uhm direction from we ourselves rather than direction from lecturers

<ICE-SIN:S1A-076#45:1:A>
Say for instance uhm maybe in fact for myself I'm interested in
transactional analysis so I really hope that I mean with the our kind of
curriculum we have uh is so heavy I I I just have to devote more time to
doing my actual school work rather than reading all this kind of things

<ICE-SIN:S1A-076#46:1:A>
I mean things that really interest me you see like aspects of
psychology in this area transactional analysis that actually

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-076#47:1:B>
And then again if everybody does that there won't be uhm
enough time to tell you what you have to know

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-076#48:1:A>
Yah but I think actually frankly speaking it's very uhm
interesting you know

<ICE-SIN:S1A-076#49:1:A>
It's really good for teaching I mean besides uh pedagogical wise
and learning classroom management everything

<ICE-SIN:S1A-076#50:1:A>
I mean all all these we're like learning now I think having a
really good knowledge uh the psychologically makeup of people is very
important

<ICE-SIN:S1A-076#51:1:A>
That's what I think

<ICE-SIN:S1A-076#52:1:A>
Because I have been reading this book by Eric Burn you know called
Games People Play

<ICE-SIN:S1A-076#53:1:A>
I think it's very good you know

<ICE-SIN:S1A-076#54:1:A>
I do not understand why it's not incorporated of

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-076#55:1:B>
Some kind of debonal kind of thing critical thinking

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-076#56:1:A>
It's not only debonal uh critically thinking kind of thing uhm
but it's more of uhm analysis into why people engage in their dysfunctional
behaviour and this

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-076#57:1:B>
Like <unclear> word </unclear>

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-076#58:1:A>
Yes uh is it will help in like uh handling uh deviance
students or students with problems you know

<ICE-SIN:S1A-076#59:1:A>
I mean classroom management all the while

<ICE-SIN:S1A-076#60:1:A>
Are you in classroom management course

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-076#61:1:B>
No I didn't pick that because I don't know I I guess I like
semi-factual things than rather than uhm actual actually dealing with people

<ICE-SIN:S1A-076#62:1:B>
Because I'm I my own strength is not very much in dealing with
people

<ICE-SIN:S1A-076#63:1:B>
Don't ask me why I'm teaching

<ICE-SIN:S1A-076#64:1:B>
But yah when I took the rizac <unclear> word </unclear> test uhm
when we're talking about career development I I'm social skill is not of my
forte

<ICE-SIN:S1A-076#65:1:B>
It wasn't wasn't any things that I was good in

<ICE-SIN:S1A-076#66:1:B>
Yah so and when teacher ask us to share you know our our conclusion
of of analysis of ourselves I was quite feeling quite sheepish about it
because I didn't have you know social that that letter S

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-076#67:1:A>
I had artistic and then the other was uhm investigative and I
can't I think enterprising

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-076#68:1:B>
Oh oh oh

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-076#69:1:A>
And that was it

<ICE-SIN:S1A-076#70:1:A>
But it takes all sorts of people to make the world

<ICE-SIN:S1A-076#71:1:A>
It doesn't mean uh

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-076#72:1:B>
Yah right

<ICE-SIN:S1A-076#73:1:B>
That's why I that how I I saw it

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-076#74:1:A>
Yah

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-076#75:1:B>
And sometimes you may not know yourself as well as other
people know you

<ICE-SIN:S1A-076#76:1:B>
Like I I keep telling my husband I'm not good with people

<ICE-SIN:S1A-076#77:1:B>
You're better

<ICE-SIN:S1A-076#78:1:B>
I'm more task-oriented

<ICE-SIN:S1A-076#79:1:B>
You're better with people so you go do the talking

<ICE-SIN:S1A-076#80:1:B>
But he he'll tell me hey no just give it a shot

<ICE-SIN:S1A-076#81:1:B>
I think your you can put yourself across quite well and you have a
listening ear

<ICE-SIN:S1A-076#82:1:B>
So I I just did it and sometimes I find myself doing quite a good
job you know when people have problems and they come to me

<ICE-SIN:S1A-076#83:1:B>
So many years I think you do have that kind of uhm uhm

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-076#84:1:A>
Maybe just that I don't see it myself

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-076#85:1:B>
Calm uh very calm cool uh kind of mannerisms and I think it's
good in that sense

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-076#86:1:A>
I don't think it being a teacher means uhm you really have to
be very social and outgoing

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-076#87:1:B>
Yah like say we have a keep a distance also so I I think maybe
uh this coldness or what you call it will help me

<ICE-SIN:S1A-076#88:1:B>
Because I I do find some of my friends becoming very close friends
with their students and I don't know if that's very healthy

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-076#89:1:A>
Yah

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-076#90:1:B>
Well I I find myself quite comfortable teaching especially
like when I'm interacting with the people

<ICE-SIN:S1A-076#91:1:B>
I'm giving tuition and so sometimes I I feel like I'm not sharing
enough like I'm not uhm communicative enough interacting enough with them to
build a good rapport

<ICE-SIN:S1A-076#92:1:B>
Then again when I look back uhm I'm doing my job in helping them
improve their language skill so uhm what what more do I want you see and they
can relate with relate relate to me very well

<ICE-SIN:S1A-076#93:1:B>
They feel comfortable with me

<ICE-SIN:S1A-076#94:1:B>
So I think I mean and that's quite an achievement so you know those

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-076#95:1:A>
Yah don't discourage yourself

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-076#96:1:B>
True

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-076#97:1:A>
But but I still think uhm whether one has uhm an S or not in
that rizac uh test

<ICE-SIN:S1A-076#98:1:A>
It's still very important and crucial to a know uhm the
psychological makeup

<ICE-SIN:S1A-076#99:1:A>
Each pupil uhm because uhm in fact even I check with my friends of
mine doing <unclear> word </unclear> problems uh they actually don't do much
of uhm really psycho analysising each pupil you see

<ICE-SIN:S1A-076#100:1:A>
I mean not really analysing a pupil's problems uhm all that things
you see or I mean even in P C C G also we don't have ready we don't really
have a counselling kind of setup you know

<ICE-SIN:S1A-076#101:1:A>
But we have already learnt counselling and things like that

<ICE-SIN:S1A-076#102:1:A>
It's just like we maybe because yah

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-076#103:1:B>
Lecturers uh gives information pupil respond teacher gives
feedback

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-076#104:1:A>
Yah it's like we just sat there and watched the video right

<ICE-SIN:S1A-076#105:1:A>
Were you watching the video and then we went back and just analyse
the you know the conversation

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-076#106:1:B>
Yah I think it was time constraining

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-076#107:1:A>
Yah but I find that maybe they should actually enlarge this
area because it's I mean

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-076#108:1:B>
Give us a real mock up

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-076#109:1:A>
Yes

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-076#110:1:B>
Of counselling session or an actual class dealing with pastor
pastoral care

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-076#111:1:A>
Because otherwise then we'll be just like uh uhm I mean we we
are just dealing with symptoms and not the problems you know

<ICE-SIN:S1A-076#112:1:A>
They they will always these pupils will always come back and the
same problems and the same problems again right make them really frustrated
you see

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-076#113:1:B>
Yah but I think pastoral care is something uhm you can't
really learn as much as you can learn uhm classroom management because it has
to do a lot with your own values and how you approach problems yourself
because it's basically sharing yourself you know being a second parent to a
child

<ICE-SIN:S1A-076#114:1:B>
That was what I told the teacher but I guess she didn't find that
uhm fitting comfortably in her lesson plan so she kind of dismissed it

<ICE-SIN:S1A-076#115:1:B>
But I still after all these weeks I still think it it's basically
teaching you how to be second parent

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-076#116:1:A>
Yah true

<ICE-SIN:S1A-076#117:1:A>
It's yah it's really like

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-076#118:1:B>
All inclusive everything you've got you just try your best to
help the child to become a better person

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-076#119:1:A>
I I just wish they can incorporate more of this uhm things
maybe next year lah probably they will

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-076#120:1:B>
More of you mean to expand

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-076#121:1:A>
More counselling yes

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-076#122:1:B>
the P C C G programme

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-076#123:1:A>
Yes more uh hand-on session practical sessions and more of uh
like uhm more new theories <unclear> word </unclear>

<ICE-SIN:S1A-076#124:1:A>
I mean those teacher theories that we learnt you know uh like uhm
the ones uhm uhm Ericson uhm

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-076#125:1:B>
Yah right

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-076#126:1:A>
Uhm it's like kind of oldish already

<ICE-SIN:S1A-076#127:1:A>
I mean it's like all those Skinner's behavioural I mean
modification

<ICE-SIN:S1A-076#128:1:A>
It's kind of it's already so back dated

<ICE-SIN:S1A-076#129:1:A>
That's what I find

<ICE-SIN:S1A-076#130:1:A>
I mean we should actually read up more or Fraud's theory

<ICE-SIN:S1A-076#131:1:A>
It's very very bad dated

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-076#132:1:B>
I find them too general

<ICE-SIN:S1A-076#133:1:B>
Uhm they may be applicable still today but I find them too general
and uh like a lot of academic theories tend to be

<ICE-SIN:S1A-076#134:1:B>
So you wouldn't find any individual case fitting very nicely into
on one model

<ICE-SIN:S1A-076#135:1:B>
But uhm there are always variations and thing I mean we are
man-made anyway some man will continue making some more theories

<ICE-SIN:S1A-076#136:1:B>
Uh yah but so far I can't say I haven't learnt anything but uh
it's just at the tip of the iceberg or maybe just the tip of the tip of the
iceberg

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-076#137:1:A>
Actually I learn I did learn a lot but it's just that uhm I
thought it could be better if they could incorporate uhm I mean give us more
time to pursue our own interest you know our own interested areas

<ICE-SIN:S1A-076#138:1:A>
Uhm you know but but the curriculum is such that we we don't
really have much time for our own interest you see

<ICE-SIN:S1A-076#139:1:A>
I mean they're nice to give us uhm three-way plan <X>

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-076#X140:1:B>
I think I think it's they're strike a compromise already
with half the term half the course devoted to uh common subjects and the
other half to specific areas so uhm perhaps what you like would be one-third
common subjects and the other two-thirds specialisation </X> </I>
