<h> Introduction </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-036#6:1>
Ferrocement is a form of reinforced concrete using closely spaced
multiple layers of mesh and/or small-diameter rods completely infiltrated
with, or encapsulated, in mortar ( 1).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-036#7:1>
It has a high tensile strength to weight ratio and possesses improved
cracking characteristics over ordinary reinforced concrete.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-036#8:1>
Moreover, it offers advantages in terms of fabrication as it can be
cast thin and to almost any shape.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-036#9:1>
Ferrocement has therefore found many applications in housing units,
water-tanks, roofing elements and others [ 2, 3, 4].

<ICE-SIN:W2A-036#10:1>
The use of ferrocement in composite construction, however, has not
been explored.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-036#11:1>
In this study, the behaviour of ferrocement-steel ( FS) and
ferrocement-ferrocement ( FF) composite beams under bending is investigated.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-036#12:1>
Eight composite beams were prepared and were each simply supported
subjected to a symmetrical two-point load.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-036#13:1>
The test results are reported and discussed herein.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-036#14:1>
<h> TEST PROGRAMME </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-036#15:1>
Test specimen

<ICE-SIN:W2A-036#16:1>
The eight test specimens were equally divided into two series, A an
B.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-036#17:1>
Series A specimens ( A1 to A4) were half-scale models of the
prototype composite construction ln buildings [ 5] while series B specimens (
B1 to B4) were one-third scale models of a footway bridge [ 6], as shown in
F1.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-036#18:1>
They were designed to have ultimate moments of resistance of
approximately 168 kNm and 600 kNm respectively under positive bending ( that
is, with the slab component ln compression).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-036#19:1>
All series A specimens composed of a ferrocement slab connected to an
I-shaped beam by through bolts.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-036#20:1>
The ferrocement slab measured 35 c in thickness and 500 mm in width.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-036#21:1>
The reinforcement for the slab consisted of layers of skeletal steel
having a grid size of 100mm, 5.4 mm and an average yield stress of 560 MPa
and 3 layers of fine wiremesh with a grid size of 12.5 mm, wire diameter of
1.22 mm and average yield stress of 360 MPa.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-036#22:1>
These reinforcements were placed centrally with respect to the
mid-depth of the slab.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-036#23:1>
For specimens A1 and A2, the beam component was a 178 mm x 102 mm x
21.54 kg/m Grade 43 steel joist.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-036#24:1>
For A3 and A4, it was a ferrocement section [ Fig.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-036#25:1>
2(a)] reinforced with 4 layers ( 2 on each face) of the first
wiremesh described earlier, and nine longitudinal steel bars with diameter of
12 mm and average yield stress of 480 MPa.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-036#26:1>
Shear connectors ( 16 mm diameter Grade 8.8 high strength steel
bolts) were provided in two rows at 100 mm spacing in A1 and A2 and at 150 mm
spacing in A3 and A4 effect the horizontal shear transfer between the slab
and beam components.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-036#27:1>
Series B specimens composed of a 20 mm thick ferrocement connected to
a U-shaped beam.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-036#28:1>
The slab was 700 mm wide and reinforced with 1 layer of the skeletal
steel and 2 layers of the fine wiremesh.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-036#29:1>
For specimens B1 a and B2, the beam was fabricated from Grade 43
steel plates while for B3 and B4 it was a ferrcocement section reinforced
with 2 layers ( 1 on each face) of fine wiremesh, supported by flatten
longitudinal steel bars with a diameter of 16 mm and average yield stress of
530 MPa [ Fig.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-036#30:1>
2(b)].

<ICE-SIN:W2A-036#31:1>
The shear connectors were provided in fours at a spacing of 50 mm for
B1 and B2 a and in twos at a spacing of 130 mm for B3 and B4.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-036#32:1>
For all specimens, the mortar mix for the ferrocement components had
a cement:sand:water ratio of 1:1.5:0.4.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-036#33:1>
A mixtures were added according to the manufacturers' recommendations
so as to improve the workability and to achieve early high strength.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-036#34:1>
Preparation of test specimens The slab and beam components were cast
separately.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-036#35:1>
For the ferrocement slabs, the positions of the shear connectors were
first marked on wooden mould.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-036#36:1>
Recesses 16 mm in diameter and 5 mm deep were then drilled into the
mould at these positions.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-036#37:1>
The steel reinforcement was placed in the mould.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-036#38:1>
Steel rods 16 mm in diameter were then hammered vertically into the
recesses and where they were obstructed, the wiremesh were cut away.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-036#39:1>
The rods were subsequently wrapped around with cloth tapes to
increase their diameters above the face of the mould to 18 mm.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-036#40:1>
Mortar was then placed into the mould on a vibrating table which
ensured proper compaction of the mix.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-036#41:1>
The casting of ferrocement beam components proceeded in three stages.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-036#42:1>
For the I-beam, the base flange was cat first.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-036#43:1>
This was followed by the casting of the top flange and finally of the
web.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-036#44:1>
For the U-beam, the base flange was cast first, the webs next and
finally the top flanges.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-036#45:1>
Holes of 18 mm diameter were provided in the top flange of the beam
components in the same manner as for the slab components.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-036#46:1>
The steel rods were removed about four hours after casting, when
mortar began to set.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-036#47:1>
The ferrocement components were cured under wet hessian for one day
and then air cured ln the laboratory for another three to four days before
demoulding.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-036#48:1>
The components were connected by passing bolts through the holes in
the slab and flanges of the beam components.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-036#49:1>
The composite beams thus prepared were subjected to tests about one
week after casting.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-036#50:1>
Test set-up and instrumentation Prior to casting, electrical
resistance strain gauges were mounted on to the skeletal steel in the slab
components at the midspan section.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-036#51:1>
Strain gauges were also mounted on the surface of the composite beams
across the depth as well as across the width at the midspan section and at
the section adjacent to the loading point within the flexural zone.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-036#52:1>
Each beam was simply supported over a span of 2.7 m and subjected to
a symmetrical two-point load as shown in Fig.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-036#53:1>
3.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-036#54:1>
The beams were tested in positive bending ( that is, slab component
in compression) for specimens Al, A3, Bl and B3 and in negative bending (
that is, slab component in tension) for the other specimens.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-036#55:1>
A linear variable displacement transducer ( LDVT) was placed below
the test specimen at the midspan to monitor the maximum deflection.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-036#56:1>
Additional transducers were placed at the two ends of the specimen to
measure the relative slip, if any, at the interface between the slab and beam
components.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-036#57:1>
All the specimens were tested to failure except B2 for which the
supports yielded prior to attainment of ultimate load.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-036#58:1>
<h> TEST RESULTS AND DISCUSSION </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-036#59:1>
<h> Load-deflection characteristics </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-036#60:1>
The load vs.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-036#61:1>
midspan deflection curves for Series A and Series B specimens are
shown ln Fig.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-036#62:1>
4(a) and ( b) respectively.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-036#63:1>
It is seen that for FS beams ( that is, specimens Al, A2, Bl and B2),
the load-deflection curves generally consist of three regimes: a regime with
a linear load-deflection relation up to the yield load, a translation regime
where yielding of steel proceeds towards the neutral axis of the critical (
midspan ) section and a regime where full plastic deformation occurs at the
section of failure.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-036#64:1>
On the other hand, FF beams ( A3, A4, B3 and B4) exhibited linear
load-deflection relation up to the cracking load.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-036#65:1>
A transition period follows during which cracks continue to develop
and the stiffness of the beam decreases.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-036#66:1>
Another linear relation is seen after the cracks have stabilized.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-036#67:1>
The stiffness of the composite beam decreases near the ultimate load.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-036#68:1>
<h> Cracking load and crack pattern </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-036#69:1>
For FS specimens under positive bending, that is, A1 and B1, the
first cracks were observed in the flexural span of the slab component at
about 30% to 40% of the ultimate load ( see Table 1).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-036#70:1>
Several longitudinal cracks appeared on the top face of the slab
component above the edges of the top flanges of the beam component and these
were probably due to the effects of transverse moments.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-036#71:1>
Due to stress concentration, random cracks were also observed to
initiate from the holes which accommodated the shear connectors.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-036#72:1>
The FS specimens ( A2 and B2), when subjected to negative bending
registered cracking loads of about 10 to 20% of the ultimate loads.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-036#73:1>
The cracks were found to concentrate within and near the flexural
span of the specimens.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-036#74:1>
These cracks traversed through the depth of the slab components as
the load is increased.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-036#75:1>
stabilized.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-036#76:1>
The stiffness of the composite beam decreases near ultimate load.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-036#77:1>
Specimens A3 and B3 ( F7 8peclolens) had lower cracking loads
compared to the equivalent FS specimens under positive bending.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-036#78:1>
The is obvious as cracks initiated in the beam components and only
appeared in the slab components at a later stage.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-036#79:1>
On the beam components, the crack first appeared as a flexural crack
from the lower flange near the middle of the shear span.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-036#80:1>
As the load was increased, more cracks appeared and these propagated
into the webs, inclining generally at approximately 45 to the longitudinal
axis.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-036#81:1>
Cracks were also observed in the flexural span, but these did not
propagate very far towards the slab components.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-036#82:1>
For specimen B3, spalling was observed along the locations of
skeletal steel at the web near the ultimate load.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-036#83:1>
The slab components for both specimens were relatively uncracked,
except for some inclined cracks within the shear spans and a few random ones
at the top face due to transverse moments and stress concentration at the
holes.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-036#84:1>
For FF specimens ( A4 and B4) under negative bending, the observed
crackling loads were about 20 to Z5% of the ultimate loads.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-036#85:1>
The cracks initiated from the bottom face of the slab components and
traversed through the slab thickness into the beam components.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-036#86:1>
As in the case of FF specimens under positive bending, more cracks
were seen in the shear span than in the flexural span and these were also
inclined at about 45 to the longitudinal axis.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-036#87:1>
Near the ultimate load, spalling of cement mortar along the location
of longitudinal skeletal steel at the webs of specimen B4 were observed.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-036#88:1>
In all the specimens, the spacing of cracks was relatively small and
the crack widths were of a magnitude less than 0.2 mm under an assumed
service load equal to 1/1.6 of the ultimate load.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-036#89:1>
This Ls probably due to the restraining effects of the reinforcement
of the ferrocement.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-036#90:1>
Strain profile and local slip Strain measurements across the depth of
the composite beams indicated that, in general, a continuity of longitudinal
strain exists across the interface between the slab and the beam components.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-036#91:1>
Thus, the shear connectors provided were adequate in ensuring
composite action in the specimens at ultimate load conditions.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-036#92:1>
This was further confirmed by the measurements of the transducers
placed at the two ends of the specimens, which registered local slip between
the components of less than 0.2 mm under the assumed service load, and less
than 1 mm near the ultimate load.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-036#93:1>
Deflection under assumed service loads The mid-span deflection of
each specimen under the assumed service load is indicated in Table 1.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-036#94:1>
In general, the maximum deflection under the assumed service load is
less than 9.5 mm, or 1/280 of the span of the specimen.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-036#95:1>
Mode of failure and ultimate strength The FS composite specimens
failed in flexure and showed considerable ductility near the ultimate load (
see Flg 4(a) and ( b)).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-036#96:1>
The ductile behavior was terminated by shear failure of the slab
components in specimens Al and Bl.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-036#97:1>
This happened when a diagonal crack propagated through the slab
towards the loading point, accompanied by delamination of the cement mortar
from the bottom face of the slab.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-036#98:1>
The experimental ultimate loads agreed very well with the predicted
values based on the method of strain compatibility and equilibrium ( see
Table 1).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-036#99:1>
The FF specimens were found to fall abruptly in shear.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-036#100:1>
This occurred when inclined cracks widened excessively and crushing
of the cement mortar at the tips of the cracks near the loading point was
observed.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-036#101:1>
The observed ultimate shear strength ranged between 35 to 77X of the
predicted ultimate flexural strength.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-036#102:1>
Fig 5 shows some of the test specimens at failure.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-036#103:1>
<h> CONCLUSIONS </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-036#104:1>
The study reported in this paper explored the use of ferrocement in
composite construction.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-036#105:1>
Eight composite beams were tested, either in positive or in negative
bending. <X>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-036#X106:1>
The specimens registered crack widths of less than O.2 mm and
maximum deflection of less than 1/280 of the span under an assumed service
load of 1/1.6 times the ultimate load.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-036#X107:1>
A11 the specimens exhibited composite action at ultimate load
condition.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-036#X108:1>
The FS beams were found to fall in flexure and possessed
considerable ductility at failure, thus indicating their suitability in
construction.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-036#X109:1>
However, the FF beams were found to fall abruptly in shear and
further works in this area are necessary. </X> </I>
