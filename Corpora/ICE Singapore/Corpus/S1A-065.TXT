<ICE-SIN:S1A-065#180:2:F>
There is nothing wrong to remain as friends as long is that
he doesn't

<$G> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-065#181:2:G>
It is easy to say that

<ICE-SIN:S1A-065#182:2:G>
It is easy to say that you know what

You know why I mean I <unclear> word </unclear>

<$F> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-065#196:2:F>
Partly because the problem is no longer a Western <unclear>
word </unclear>

<ICE-SIN:S1A-065#197:2:F>
It becomes a <unclear> word </unclear>

<$G> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-065#198:2:G>
No longer of the of the developing world lah and because the
problem started from the West right

<$F> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-065#199:2:F>
Doesn't it doesn't no it kind of started from Africa

<$G> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-065#200:2:G>
Ya but it is like transported because of some Western values
you see so the thing is whether that problem uh has become a international
thing

<ICE-SIN:S1A-065#201:2:G>
And so definitely

<$F> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-065#202:2:F>
You mean to say the culprit is now the West

<ICE-SIN:S1A-065#203:2:F>
That is why <unclear> word </unclear>

<$G> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-065#204:2:G>
I think so

<ICE-SIN:S1A-065#205:2:G>
You see it is no longer a it is it's it's no longer a Western
thing you know

<ICE-SIN:S1A-065#206:2:G>
A lot of Americans have aids

<ICE-SIN:S1A-065#207:2:G>
You get what I mean

<ICE-SIN:S1A-065#208:2:G>
Now is that a lot of Thais have aids because of what

<$F> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-065#209:2:F>
Yes yes yes

<$G> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-065#210:2:G>
You know

<$F> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-065#211:2:F>
I know what you mean

<$G> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-065#212:2:G>
And you can't say it is because of the Thais themselves

<ICE-SIN:S1A-065#213:2:G>
Someone must have forced it

<ICE-SIN:S1A-065#214:2:G>
In order to under to accept that right you also accept
responsibility of course

<ICE-SIN:S1A-065#215:2:G>
So I would rather not talk about it </I>
