<ICE-SIN:W2C-016#3:1>
STRANDED and starving, 53 Sri Lankan workers who came here on promises
of jobs are now taking refuge at the Holy Family Church in Chapel Road and
the Sri Lankaramaya Buddhist Temple in St Michael's Road.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-016#4:1>
But their ordeal will soon be over.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-016#5:1>
Most of them will be repatriated by Saturday.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-016#6:1>
But those who speak English may be held back to help police
investigations.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-016#7:1>
Two weeks ago, their agents disappeared, and with them, their daily
food allowances of
&dollar;5-&dollar;7. 

<ICE-SIN:W2C-016#8:1>
After a week of starving, they turned up at Tanglin Police
Station on Monday for help.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-016#9:1>
They were taken away and locked up by the immigration authorities on
Tuesday and then let out on Thursday, when they ended up at the church and
the temple.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-016#10:1>
This is their story, as told by several of the Sri Lankans.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-016#11:1>
About 80 of them paid between
&dollar;2,550 and
&dollar;3,408 to an agent in Sri Lanka, who promised them jobs here for two years.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-016#12:1>
They could not say what happened to the others.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-016#13:1>
Some of them borrowed from moneylenders and friends to raise the
money while others took loans against their land or houses.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-016#14:1>
The agent was helped by two men in Sri Lanka and another in
Singapore.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-016#15:1>
The four met workers as they arrived in batches over April and May
this year.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-016#16:1>
Upon arrival, their passports and return tickets were taken away by
the agents.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-016#17:1>
They received work permits fakes, it turned out.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-016#18:1>
At the church yesterday, officials from the Ministry of Labour were
interviewing the workers.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-016#19:1>
Parish priest Father Alfred Chan told The Sunday Times: " They showed
up haggard and hungry with no place to go.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-016#20:1>
Our kindergarten class is on holiday now, so I let them stay."

<ICE-SIN:W2C-016#21:1>
He said they were well-behaved and even cleaned the church grounds
without being asked.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-016#22:1>
Mr Oswald Tillekeratne, the Sri Lankan High Commissioner in
Singapore, said his staff spent a sleepless Friday night looking for the
men's passports and tickets.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-016#23:1>
Seventeen passports were found in shops along Serangoon Road.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-016#24:1>
He said: " We are trying to house them in temples or in the homes of
more well-to-do Sri Lankans here." Those without passports will be issued new
travel documents.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-016#25:1>
Those without tickets will receive replacements from Airlanka or UTA
he said.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-016#26:1>
The High Commission has sent descriptions of the three Sri Lankan
agents to police in Colombo.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-016#27:1>
English and Sinhalese newspapers in Sri Lanka have also given wide
coverage to the affair, which he hoped would stop others from falling prey.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-016#28:1>
But Mr M P J A Waas, a 39-year-old seaman with a four-year-old
daughter in Sri Lanka, said that very little could be done for him now.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-016#29:1>
In halting English, he said: " How can I pay back the money I
borrowed to come here?

<ICE-SIN:W2C-016#30:1>
They will take away my house.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-016#31:1>
I will die there. " </I>

<h> S'pore's record against music piracy the best in S-E Asia </h>
<h> Only 5 % of revenue went to fakes </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2C-016#33:2>
By John Lui

<ICE-SIN:W2C-016#34:2>
SINGAPORE now has the best record against music piracy in South-east
Asia, according to an official from a piracy watchdog group.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-016#35:2>
And this record is second only to Hongkong in Asia.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-016#36:2>
But a new breed of high-tech pirates - illegally copying compact
discs ( CDs) - lurks around the corner.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-016#37:2>
Ms Lisa Gordon, director of communications of the International
Federation of the Phonographic Industry ( IFPI), told The Straits Times that
only 5 per cent of money spent on music here last year went to pirates
compared with 90 per cent a decade ago.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-016#38:2>
IFPI is a worldwide body of sound recording and video producers that
acts against music piracy.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-016#39:2>
She said: " Singapore is now a model for other countries in
South-East Asia to follow.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-016#40:2>
It's an accomplishment which speaks for itself." She praised the
local office of the IFPI, the police, the Law and Home Affairs ministries in
nearly wiping out the sale of pirated cassettes here.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-016#41:2>
With fewer pirates, legitimate recording companies are making more
money than ever, she said.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-016#42:2>
Recording labels will also foster more new artistes, helping
Singapore become a regional artistic and cultural centre, she added.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-016#43:2>
Last year, Singaporeans spent
&dollar;112 million on music, an increase of 13.5 per cent over 1991.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-016#44:2>
Ms Gordon is among 200 delegates at the Westin Plaza Hotel attending
a three-day conference on the music business in the Pacific Rim.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-016#45:2>
The conference, which ends today, is organised by the International
Music Market, a Europe-based music marketing company.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-016#46:2>
Ms Gordon presented a paper on the state of music piracy in Asia on
Monday.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-016#47:2>
She told The Straits Times that in this decade, the IFPI will have to
fight a new breed of high-tech pirates.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-016#48:2>
At present, there are many affordable second-hand CD manufacturing
machines available to Asian businessmen, she said.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-016#49:2>
Over eight million pirated discs were sold in Asia in 1991.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-016#50:2>
They were believed to have been made in places such as Taiwan,
Thailand and China.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-016#51:2>
In fact, the IFPI has civil suits pending against five Singapore
companies which allegedly sold about 40,000 pirated CDs last year.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-016#52:2>
Unlike cassettes, pirated discs can be easily passed off as
legitimate copies, she said.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-016#53:2>
This means recording companies would have to be more sophisticated
than the pirates.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-016#54:2>
They may have to stamp a digital code on the CDs so that officials
armed with machine " readers" can quickly single out the fakes, she said.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-016#55:2>
The 1987 Copyright Act makes it an offence to copy intellectual works
without authorisation.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-016#56:2>
Offenders can be fined up to
&dollar;10,000 per illegal copy, with a
&dollar;100,000 maximum, and be sentenced to up to five years' jail. </I>

<h> Take some scrap parts, use your imagination and you get sculpture
</h>

<ICE-SIN:W2C-016#58:3>

<ICE-SIN:W2C-016#59:3>
SWATCH watches claim to be part of the arts, but Singapore Automotive
Engineering believes that art is born of parts.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-016#60:3>
Scrap parts from its workshops are being bent, hammered and welded
into sculpture by employees in a novel programme to bring culture into a
world of rivets and steel.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-016#61:3>
Twelve employees, including five women, are taking weekly classes
conducted by artist Vincent Leow at the firm's workshops in Portsdown Road.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-016#62:3>
Said Mr Leow: " I hope to have fun with the students.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-016#63:3>
They are all eager and have good ideas.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-016#64:3>
I'm showing them how to bring it out." In just three lessons, rusty
struts, wheels and rods have been turned into objects called Arrow of Love,
Promise of the Future and The Horse.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-016#65:3>
One of the creators of The Horse, computer operator Mary Ang,
23,signed up because she always wanted to " learn how guys do welding and to
feel what it's like to wear overalls".

<ICE-SIN:W2C-016#66:3>
" I saw that the scrap pieces I took looked like the body of a horse,
I decided to make one.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-016#67:3>
Welding is fun," she said.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-016#68:3>
Students learnt how to wield the 150 volt arc welding set from Mr
Leow and those among them who are experienced in welding.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-016#69:3>
Mr Nasrudin Sahari, 39, welds all day at SAE, working on vehicles,
but he said:

<ICE-SIN:W2C-016#70:3>
" Sculpture is different.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-016#71:3>
I can't design when I'm working on a vehicle.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-016#72:3>
But I can do what I like here, and I find it satisfying." Advertising
and promotions executive May Ng, 32, who is also taking the class, said she
hoped to have staff skilled enough to make sculpture good enough to be sold
for charity.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-016#73:3>
SAE, which is a subsidiary of Chartered Industries of Singapore, the
ordnance arm of Singapore Technologies, is involved in activities ranging
from the upgrading of military vehicles to taxi rental.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-016#74:3>
The management agreed to let the workers off an hour early to attend
the eight two-and-a-half hour classes and foot the
&dollar;5,000 plus bill.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-016#75:3>
Also, the classes recycle the company's small amount of scrap, which
would otherwise have been thrown away, said Ms Ng.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-016#76:3>
She said that until they are good enough to be sold, the student's
works may find their way into the firm's small park, framing a carp pond.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-016#77:3>
But the classes' most enthusiastic student, Mr Sabahni Zainal, 29,
welder, felt his work was ready to be shown.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-016#78:3>
In just three weeks, he has made a small-scale car and four abstract
pieces.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-016#79:3>
He said proudly: " Just chrome any of them and they will look good in
your house." </I>

<h> Stricter enforcement needed on child restraint law, dealers say
We have been taking action against those who flout law: Traffic Police </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2C-016#81:4>
by John Lui

<ICE-SIN:W2C-016#82:4>
NINE major dealers, sitting on 27,000 unsold child restraints, have
complained to the Traffic Police, saying that the authorities should do more
to encourage people to buy the safety seats.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-016#83:4>
One of the dealers said that they had placed big orders on the urging
of the Traffic Police when the law on compulsory child restraints was to be
introduced .

<ICE-SIN:W2C-016#84:4>
Project executive Phillip Tan of Car Dynamics, which sells
restraints, said: " We feel there's not enough enforcement.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-016#85:4>
There's also no publicity about those being booked."

<ICE-SIN:W2C-016#86:4>
The businessmen are sitting unhappily on 27,000 child restraints
valued at more than
&dollar;2 million, he told The Straits Times.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-016#87:4>
When the Traffic Police met the nine dealers in February this year,
they were sympathetic.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-016#88:4>
They promised stricter enforcement and wider publicity, he said.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-016#89:4>
" We hope more can be done to make parents aware of the dangers of
driving without child restraints.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-016#90:4>
We believe many are still not using them," he said.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-016#91:4>
According to dealers, sales show that less than half of the vehicles
which need them have them.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-016#92:4>
A Traffic Police spokesman confirmed the February meeting and said: "
The dealers were informed that with the end of the educational phase, as it
was nearly five to eight months after the introduction of the new child
restraint requirements, enforcement action was being taken."

<ICE-SIN:W2C-016#93:4>
He said meetings with the motor trade industry were to keep the
police abreast of developments in the industry.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-016#94:4>
The dealers sell brands like Evenflo, Aprica, Safe-n-Sound, HTS and
Britax Romer.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-016#95:4>
Mr Brinal Chua, sales manager of Car Dynamics, said that his company
had imported 12,000 seats before the child restraint laws were passed in July
last year.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-016#96:4>
The Traffic Police had urged dealers to make restraints readily
available to the public, he said.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-016#97:4>
" If I had known sales would be so slow, I would not have bothered,"
he said.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-016#98:4>
His company is storing 6,000 unsold seats valued at
&dollar;800,000, in two warehouses at a cost of
&dollar;10,000 a year.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-016#99:4>
The company has also spent
&dollar;200,000 on advertising.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-016#100:4>
" We had expected a rush to buy when the laws were introduced last
July.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-016#101:4>
We are still waiting," he lamented.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-016#102:4>
A market survey by the industry, based on census reports and figures
from the Registry of vehicles had shown that one-third of the 300,000
passenger cars here needed restraints.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-016#103:4>
As of July last year, children under eight years sitting in the
front seat of a car, pickup or truck had to be secured with child restraints.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-016#104:4>
In October, this requirement was extended to children sitting in the
back seat if there were rear seat-belts.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-016#105:4>
Seat belt laws: 183 booked ONE hundred and eighty-three people have
been hauled up by the Traffic Police for flouting seat belt laws so far this
year, 56 of them for not putting restraints on children in their vehicles.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-016#106:4>
In a statement to The Straits Times on Saturday the Traffic Police
said at least 127 ignored the available rear seat belts in their vehicle.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-016#107:4>
As of last Friday, 56 motorists had been summoned for ignoring the
child restraint requirements.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-016#108:4>
As the rules were introduced for the safety of motorists and their
passengers, all motorists should observe them, said the police.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-016#109:4>
So far, two children under eight years have been killed in reports
of accidents since the child restraint law was introduced.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-016#110:4>
Neither child was in a restraint.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-016#111:4>
In December, Mohammad Iqbal, a two-month-old baby boy, died along
with three adults after the car he was in crashed into a bus along Woodlands
Road.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-016#112:4>
The second case occurred last Tuesday.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-016#113:4>
Two-year-old Liang Seh Yong died when the van he was travelling in
was involved in a collision with a motorcycle along Shunfu Road. <X>

<ICE-SIN:W2C-016#X114:4>
The police are investigating both cases.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-016#X115:4>
The penalty for not using a child restraint is a
&dollar;120 fine and three demerit points. </X> </I>
