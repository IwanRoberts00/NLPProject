<ICE-SIN:W1B-008#2:2>
Dear Dylan,

<ICE-SIN:W1B-008#3:2>
Have not heard from you almost for ages, aeons, centuries - - seems
like ETERNITY actually.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-008#4:2>
Anyway, as is the case, there are so many things to say and tell and
paradoxically ( sometimes; maybe all the time for you) there is nothing to
say.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-008#5:2>
Nonetheless I think we somehow lost connection along the way ( due, I
think, to both the workload for the year that has just ended and your
non-sedentary, shifting, ever-restless movement over God-knows-where).

<ICE-SIN:W1B-008#6:2>
So, to begin with, the reason for this note/letter/memo is because
Paul came over to the hostel at Eusoff College and told me you called and
would be leaving the ashram where you are now by the end of March and that I
had better write you something before you're again " SOMEWHERE OUT THERE" and
where nobody can reach you by mail/air/phone or whatever the latest
technology has invented.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-008#7:2>
Yes!, the exams just ended on the 20th March 93 and thanks to the "
POWERS THAT BE", it has been a rough ( to say the least) year.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-008#8:2>
" Things got bad and things got worse" ( to borrow the line from CCR)
but the important ( oh really?) thing is that I survived and got through ( at
least completed) the most absurd/crazy/face-contorting thing they call EXAMS.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-008#9:2>
I really am not expecting much from the exams or the quality of the
results because of the many knocks/distractions along the way and of course,
my still so-reluctant-to-accept-the-system kind of attitude.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-008#10:2>
Nonetheless, I have to say that I endured and did at times ( really!)
transcend the madness - - even though these were few and far between.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-008#11:2>
Have been staying at Eusoff College for about 15 months now ( great,
wonderful, splendid place - - no doubt) and sadly will be leaving to go back
to Yishun by the 31st March, which means I'll have about a week to sort
things out and get started on life at home again.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-008#12:2>
Good thing is, I'll be going to either Thailand or Indonesia for
about 6 weeks from 10 April and shall try to recover from what I call A YEAR
OF MADNESS.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-008#13:2>
Will spend some time living it up and recovering from the loss before
the term in IE begins in July.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-008#14:2>
Paul will be staying in Eusoff College for a month or two ( yes, he
will be taking over my room!) and trying to complete his thesis - - something
I think he shouldn't have much problem with.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-008#15:2>
He has been visiting me quite regularly for runs and dinners ( if not
at the Adam Road Food Centre than its somewhere in town).

<ICE-SIN:W1B-008#16:2>
We talk about you often in these session and wonder what in the world
you are doing out there sometimes.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-008#17:2>
And yes, when it's a full moon the karmic particles that form an
invisible bridge does help us to remember you better ( whatever this may mean
to you - - but it really does, OK?).

<ICE-SIN:W1B-008#18:2>
So to sign off, I think if you should ever receive this letter, you
should write me sometime ( whenever you feel up to it) and you should address
it to:

<ICE-SIN:W1B-008#19:2>
Block 123, Yishun Ave 99,

<ICE-SIN:W1B-008#20:2>
ICE-SIN:W1B-008#32-987, S(2776)

<ICE-SIN:W1B-008#21:2>
This is the address I'll be staying ( actually it's my sister's
place) for sometime - - I think for a very long time in fact.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-008#22:2>
So, before I go, there are actually many, many, many other things
that have taken place/ changed my life ( positively or negatively I can never
tell) that I had thought I wanted to write down but am unable.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-008#23:2>
Nonetheless to cut the long ( and sometimes sad) story short, Nothing
Has Happened - - it depends on the perceiver as well as the perceived, as I
think you would agree.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-008#24:2>
But here's a word that may hint at my present state of mind: " THERE
IS DIGNITY IN WORK ONLY IF IT IS FREELY CHOSEN" - - Camus.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-008#25:2>
So is Sisyphus on to new heights?

<ICE-SIN:W1B-008#26:2>
Will see you soon then, hopefully.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-008#27:2>
Take care, take it easy ( as we always say) and am hoping to hear
from you.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-008#28:2>
Bon Voyage

<ICE-SIN:W1B-008#29:2>

<I>

<ICE-SIN:W1B-008#30:3>
Dear Guru,

<ICE-SIN:W1B-008#31:3>
I thought the Enlightened One had forgotten his brothers in Samsara.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-008#32:3>
We're wondering if you've taken on a vow of silence and become a monk
somewhere.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-008#33:3>
But then we remembered your horny ways and came to the conclusion
that you must've found ecstasy and oblivion in some more earthly quarters.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-008#34:3>
The last word we got from you was a crumpled postcard from Ladakh
that didn't say very much.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-008#35:3>
Your mum was so worried at one stage.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-008#36:3>
So was Mary and myself.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-008#37:3>
It was good that we waited a little longer before doing something
drastic.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-008#38:3>
I thought and tried to tell your mum that you probably needed some
quiet time.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-008#39:3>
So, are you home again?

<ICE-SIN:W1B-008#40:3>
Have you found a maid?

<ICE-SIN:W1B-008#41:3>
I had a strange dream some time ago.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-008#42:3>
I saw you with a Nepali wife and a trail of kids back here, walking
the streets, looking for a place.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-008#43:3>
It was snowing in Singapore and the scene was quite different from
the hell we know.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-008#44:3>
You looked quite a family man, buying hot steaming noodles for your
kids.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-008#45:3>
Can't remember how it ended.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-008#46:3>
Your mum must have told you about Thomas.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-008#47:3>
It was a good thing they found him early.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-008#48:3>
He's recovered but seems quite ready to go any moment.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-008#49:3>
I mean he spoke of little else except " letting Nature run its
course".

<ICE-SIN:W1B-008#50:3>
The important thing is he is at peace.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-008#51:3>
Strange, it happened about the same time as Bede's stroke.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-008#52:3>
Matthew has just finished his exams and will be leaving for a short
trip, either Thailand or Indonesia.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-008#53:3>
He's had one or two romantic disappointments during the last year
which he is quite used to by now.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-008#54:3>
It's going to be a lonely old town when he's gone.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-008#55:3>
It's almost a year now since your departure.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-008#56:3>
I hope you've done some thinking along the way and come to a decision
as to which road to take.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-008#57:3>
We aren't getting no younger.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-008#58:3>
I'm sure whatever path you choose it will be the right one.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-008#59:3>
We have to make things work.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-008#60:3>
Forgive me if I sound incoherent.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-008#61:3>
Your mum just called to say that you would be leaving the ashram soon
and with a raging fever I write so that I might catch you.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-008#62:3>
I've not been feeling well for a while.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-008#63:3>
The body is falling apart and the soul is quite undernourished.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-008#64:3>
I'll be finishing in a few months' time.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-008#65:3>
And after that, I know not what awaits me.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-008#66:3>
Anyway, I'm quite resigned by now to the rotten state the world is in
and quite prepared for things to get worse.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-008#67:3>
Do send some good news if you can.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-008#68:3>
About the wife and the kids.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-008#69:3>
Hope you find the strength to leave India sometime.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-008#70:3>
Otherwise, you might not be able to get out, for we know that India
is a more dangerous addiction than either a Welsh Rose or the snow leopard.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-008#71:3>
I guess I'll stop here.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-008#72:3>
This fever is making my head spin.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-008#73:3>
Do take care and write about the journey.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-008#74:3>
Yours,

<ICE-SIN:W1B-008#75:3>
Paul

<ICE-SIN:W1B-008#76:3>
P/S Your last letter did not get through.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-008#77:3>
Perhaps you got the address wrong.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-008#78:3>
So here it is: Blk 747,
&hash;00-9000 Ave 4, Punggol Point, S'pore 4676. </I>

Sat 27/3/93

<ICE-SIN:W1B-008#80:4>
Dear Dylan,

<ICE-SIN:W1B-008#81:4>
I'm sure glad you finally wrote again.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-008#82:4>
Hope this time the letter will reach you.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-008#83:4>
Guess your mum told you that I wrote you in Kathmandu but I had
overestimated the length of your stay at Benares & so posted my letter too
late.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-008#84:4>
In fact that letter encloses an aerogram that was returned to sender
from Dharamsala.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-008#85:4>
I've only just received your postcard which was written on 11th March
only yesterday.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-008#86:4>
So guess it's more likely I'll get another returned mail.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-008#87:4>
But anyway no harm trying.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-008#88:4>
My life's still the pits, though at least I've been able to abstain
from smoking for a little over a month.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-008#89:4>
I was rather hooked at one point to the extent of needing 1 or 2 fags
everyday.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-008#90:4>
It's not so much the health factor I had in mind but the
uncomfortable truth that it is an addiction that I may not be able to shake
off in future.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-008#91:4>
And anyway, I've also come to terms with the fact that the reason for
my depression will be here to stay & if I were to need that thing so badly
I'm just ruining my life & losing control.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-008#92:4>
By the way, what a coincidence that I also chose to write to you on
Valentine's Day.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-008#93:4>
It's probably depressing you had to spend yours in such an "
unglamorous" fashion.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-008#94:4>
But a few years/ many years down the road you'll probably look back &
remember it as such an unforgettable experience.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-008#95:4>
Mine was totally bland.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-008#96:4>
Jocelyn's exams should be over by now.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-008#97:4>
We've been meeting up quite a few times even up till less than a
month before her papers.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-008#98:4>
Guess I can look her up again.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-008#99:4>
Nowadays with Lian Huay totally engulfed in her job prospecting for
foreign exchange market clients I seem to have lost that everyday
companionship in watching movies.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-008#100:4>
Peter's always taking naps or out & sometimes I call to find out
he's out at camp & never asked me along.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-008#101:4>
I wonder if his suspicion of you having a woman when you declared
you won't write for awhile applies to him as well.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-008#102:4>
Well, of course life's not totally dreary.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-008#103:4>
At least there're little perks in life such as my tennis is
improving - - well not so tremendously but at least enough to allow me and
another girl to beat 2 guys, one of whom is really powerful & plays
strategically 3-0, though eventually we still lost the game 4-6.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-008#104:4>
Hey, gotta get off.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-008#105:4>
I'll just pen off here!

<ICE-SIN:W1B-008#106:4>
Hope you have another wonderful 6 months immersing in the Indian
air.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-008#107:4>
Hey, do write longer letters so I can know what's up in your mind -
- logic - - rather than being an unfathomable pilgrim - - moving on & on - -
like the rolling stone you fear most to be.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-008#108:4>
Take care!

<ICE-SIN:W1B-008#109:4>
Love,

<ICE-SIN:W1B-008#110:4>

Shantivanam,

3/4/93

<ICE-SIN:W1B-008#113:5>
Dear Mary,

<ICE-SIN:W1B-008#114:5>
Good to hear from you finally.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-008#115:5>
The last letter I got from you was in Dharamsala last Oct!

<ICE-SIN:W1B-008#116:5>
You sound pretty low.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-008#117:5>
When you mentioned that " the reason for my depression will be here
to stay", I'm wondering if you're feeling down on life in general, or your
job, or something more specific.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-008#118:5>
Sounds like you need a holiday - - a long one.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-008#119:5>
Do you really like your job?

<ICE-SIN:W1B-008#120:5>
Do you really like your life?

<ICE-SIN:W1B-008#121:5>
Is that what you really want to do?

<ICE-SIN:W1B-008#122:5>
Or are you feeling stuck?

<ICE-SIN:W1B-008#123:5>
The letters I got from you and especially from Paul and Matthew all
seem to convey an utter sense of despair and hopelessness, a sense of
stuckness with no way out.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-008#124:5>
And you guys are wondering why I'm staying in India so long!!

<ICE-SIN:W1B-008#125:5>
I'm happy here in India.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-008#126:5>
I've been basically on the spiritual path - - doing meditation
retreats, staying at ashrams and Buddhist centres.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-008#127:5>
It's been a beautiful journey of learning and communion with kindred
souls.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-008#128:5>
A profound lesson I've learnt is that one's happiness ultimately
does not depend on externals.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-008#129:5>
But having said that, I would be very cautious about preaching this
message to you guys drowning in your own dukkha because I'm well aware of how
hard it would be to practice it myself once I'm back in S'pore.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-008#130:5>
I'm leaving the ashram today and slowly heading back up north to
Dharamsala and that general area to sit out the hot season for 2-3 months.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-008#131:5>
I'm stopping off at Goa for maybe 2 weeks on the way up.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-008#132:5>
It's funny but in all these 7 months in India I haven't really spent
much time relaxing on a beach, despite being the beachbum that I am.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-008#133:5>
I did have a few days to kill in Goa in Nov just before heading off
for a Vipassana retreat, and in early Jan I was in Kerala but I was having
quite a stressful time in my relationship with the girl I was with ( we split
up in Kerala), so I'm now very much looking forward to hanging out on a beach
for awhile, listening to the breathing of the ocean and letting everything
dissolve into the Great Mother. <X>

<ICE-SIN:W1B-008#X134:5>
I can say with 99% certainty that I should be back in S'pore by the
end of the year at the very latest.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-008#X135:5>
If you think you can get some time off in Dec maybe we could do a
small trip somewhere, and Peter too, it would be his school holidays.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-008#X136:5>
What is that pathetic guy doing, I haven't heard from him at all.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-008#X137:5>
Don't feel offended if he doesn't ask you along on his weekend
camps, I think he needs time to himself.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-008#X138:5>
Personally, I doubt if he's " having a woman", as you suspect.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-008#X139:5>
I wonder if time seems to be going really quickly for you or
whether it's dragging its heels.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-008#X140:5>
For me it's really flying - - even though I have a new visa that
will see me through till Sept, it seems to me more like 6 weeks than 6
months.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-008#X141:5>
I congratulate you on your efforts to stop smoking.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-008#X142:5>
Keep it up, you really don't need it.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-008#X143:5>
And I appreciate your efforts at trying to get in touch with me at
Kathmandu.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-008#X144:5>
The letters that I send to you to share with the rest of the gang I
hope you've done that ( Paul's phone no.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-008#X145:5>
is 1234567 in case you think it's easier to contact him directly
rather than go through Peter).

<ICE-SIN:W1B-008#X146:5>
If you're still feeling depressed my temporary advice to you is to
meditate, and if you find that inapplicable for some reason then my advice is
to hang out at ABC - - I think it's a good centre, you might meet some
interesting people there.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-008#X147:5>
For Peter I have no advice.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-008#X148:5>
Maybe a cold shower might help.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-008#X149:5>
Hope to hear from you soon.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-008#X150:5>
I wish you peace and joy.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-008#X151:5>
Love,

<ICE-SIN:W1B-008#X152:5>
Dylan </X> </I>
