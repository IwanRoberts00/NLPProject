<h> WHEN THE TABEBUIA BLOOMED AT SOO CHOW GARDENS </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2F-020#2:1>
HO POH FUN

<ICE-SIN:W2F-020#3:1>
A sixty-four year old man paused momentarily at the entrance of a
modestly furnished two-storey corner terrace house at Soo Chow Gardens.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-020#4:1>
He lifted the latch, pushed through the gate, and was soon on the
road.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-020#5:1>
At once a shrill cry hit the air.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-020#6:1>
It came from a three-year-old child from the room in the house where
she was being coaxed to finish her cereal.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-020#7:1>
By mutual agreement, the child was deposited at the house early each
morning so that she could be looked after while both her parents were away at
work.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-020#8:1>
Her parents had already left.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-020#9:1>
That morning her paternal grandfather had spoken of taking her out
with him on a stroll around the neighbourhood and she wondered whether he had
forgotten.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-020#10:1>
" Yeh Yeh is just going out to look at the trees," said old Mr Lee in
an effort to reassure his grandchild.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-020#11:1>
This was after he had retraced his steps back to the house and poked
his head in at the door.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-020#12:1>
" Yeh Yeh will wait outside for Cai Yen.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-020#13:1>
Cai Yen is a good girl.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-020#14:1>
Good girls always finish their cereal.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-020#15:1>
You have finished?

<ICE-SIN:W2F-020#16:1>
Good girl!

<ICE-SIN:W2F-020#17:1>
Now you can go wash up, get dressed and put on your shoes".

<ICE-SIN:W2F-020#18:1>
" Don't forget your hat".

<ICE-SIN:W2F-020#19:1>
To his wife, seated watchful at the table, he asked, " Did you notice
that the trees are in bloom?"

<ICE-SIN:W2F-020#20:1>
Mr Lee could not remember when the trees were first planted at Soo
Chow Gardens.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-020#21:1>
In fact he only came to know their name when some men from the Parks
and Recreation Department came to lop off some branches that hindered the
growth of the prized Christmas trees planted at the corner of his garden.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-020#22:1>
He had sent a letter complaining about the branches of the " said
tree" obstructing his Christmas tree.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-020#23:1>
He was referring specifically to the tree planted on the sidewalk
just in front of his house.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-020#24:1>
He was still referring to the " said tree" when the men arrived with
their ladder and saws.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-020#25:1>
The supervisor of the team said to him very politely, " Excuse me,
Sir.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-020#26:1>
The name of the 'said tree' is 'Tabebuia'".

<ICE-SIN:W2F-020#27:1>
For a long while, the trees had merely existed as just the right kind
to cultivate to provide shade for pedestrian and parked car.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-020#28:1>
So Mr Lee thought.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-020#29:1>
Each tree provided strong horizontal branching, with large
tongue-like leaflets spread out in clusters of five - like the outspread
palms of men's hands, nature-fashioned.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-020#30:1>
They were fast-growing and never needed individual tending.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-020#31:1>
A few days ago, while inspecting the vandas in his garden, he had
paused to look down the road.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-020#32:1>
A few trees were beginning to flower.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-020#33:1>
He thought the mauve pink flowers very pretty amidst the green
foliage.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-020#34:1>
This morning every tree along the road appeared to be flowering.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-020#35:1>
Most of the houses in the neighbourhood remained shut during the day.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-020#36:1>
Mr Lee thought that the sight of the Tabebuia flowering in such rich
profusion would inevitably change the mood of the entire place.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-020#37:1>
The Tabebuia had its essence planted everywhere in the estate - Soo
Chow View down Soo Chow Garden Road to Soo Chow Rise, Soo Chow Drive and Soo
Chow Walk.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-020#38:1>
Even the most unsociable of inhabitants would be drawn out to admire
the scenery.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-020#39:1>
Most of the trees measured at least ten metres if not more in height.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-020#40:1>
One subspecies featured trees spangled with crisp pink wing-like
blooms.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-020#41:1>
Another featured trees so heavily mounted by pink petals that the
greenery on each branch looked almost totally obliterated.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-020#42:1>
The Tabebuia was in bloom at Soo Chow Gardens.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-020#43:1>
The atmosphere was certainly very festive.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-020#44:1>
The vibrant pink set against the vibrant green of most of the trees
threatened to engulf every inhabitant's general notion of the sky.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-020#45:1>
Yet there was something rather disturbing about the thought.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-020#46:1>
The estate was probably named after Suchou - one of the better scenic
spots of China - a place of high culture, the confluence of China's best
poets and scholars, a place where emperors reputedly got intoxicated, if not
drunk, by the empire's most beautiful women.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-020#47:1>
The Tabebuia?

<ICE-SIN:W2F-020#48:1>
He had heard that it originated in South America.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-020#49:1>
He could well understand the aspiration to link even one staid spot
in Singapore with the beauties and the sublimities of Suchou.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-020#50:1>
But the Tabebuia?

<ICE-SIN:W2F-020#51:1>
What had a native from South America to do with the Suchou of China -
granted that the Suchou of China had something to do with Singapore?

<ICE-SIN:W2F-020#52:1>
His eyes pierced the trees as he pondered hard and long to arrive at
a satisfactory answer.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-020#53:1>
A strong wind had blown through the estate the night before, and the
morning after, several of the fragile flowers were found severed from their
stalks.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-020#54:1>
Then came a heavy drizzle, separating flowers from their stalks more
cleanly.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-020#55:1>
And now - after the mist had lifted the mauve pink flowers lay
scattered in drains, spilled over hedges into private gardens, and spread
like loosely-crafted carpets on sidewalk and road.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-020#56:1>
Mr Lee observed the floral waste and wondered whether there was any
reason to feel sorry for the flowers that lay crushed - having been trodden
on unintentionally by feet - or flattened - having been rolled over
unintentionally by tyres.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-020#57:1>
The translucence of the petals might have attracted the eye about an
hour ago.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-020#58:1>
Now they looked horribly pasty and twisted.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-020#59:1>
He could imagine more of the petals slowly changing colour as the
temperature rose further in the day.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-020#60:1>
He took time to stoop down and pick up a flower that had probably
just fallen from a tree.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-020#61:1>
The bloom in his hand had not yet turned a dark amethyst.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-020#62:1>
There it lay - still and naked without its stalk.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-020#63:1>
He could not refrain from lifting the dank folds of the soft-hued
petals.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-020#64:1>
They exposed a pale tender sheath-like interior that glistened with
the quality of some undefinable warmth.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-020#65:1>
" Yeh Yeh, I'm ready!" sang the very precocious Cai Yen as she
skipped down the garden towards him, her voice electrifying the air.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-020#66:1>
The child certainly looked very smart, thought Mr Lee.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-020#67:1>
She seemed capable of overthrowing the old world cliche of the "
sweet young thing".

<ICE-SIN:W2F-020#68:1>
She had on that morning a navy blue and red T-shirt the kind that
always looked right on a bright and well-fed exuberant child - and matching
navy blue shorts.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-020#69:1>
She waved a nifty little sun hat as she skipped.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-020#70:1>
Each time her soles hit the ground her sneakers squeaked.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-020#71:1>
Mr Lee looked at his wife and saw how relieved she was as she
discharged her care.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-020#72:1>
She cut a matronly figure and wasn't exactly shapeless.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-020#73:1>
But years of doing the same chores in front of the kitchen sink and
trundling around with heavy marketing baskets had turned her arms stocky and
her fingers swollen and stodgy.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-020#74:1>
When he first courted her, she had been the slenderest of seven
sisters.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-020#75:1>
He looked at his wife again and sighed.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-020#76:1>
" Remember not to dash across the road, and make sure that you keep
very close to Yeh Yeh," said the woman.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-020#77:1>
Then she turned back into the house with a certain grace - as if
after so many years she still found in it an intrinsic fascination.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-020#78:1>
The child chattered all the way along So Chow View and down the
sidewalk as it dipped rather sharply into Soo Chow Garden Road.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-020#79:1>
At intervals she sang snatches of songs she had learnt at Sunday
School.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-020#80:1>
Sometimes she grew restless and ran ahead, quite oblivious of the
other's presence.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-020#81:1>
Then she stopped, thinking that she had run too far ahead.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-020#82:1>
She leaned against a railing mounted along the edge of the terraced
drain and gazed up at the way she had come, her ears filled with the sound of
gushing water flowing from some unknown source after the rain.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-020#83:1>
She watched her grandfather approaching the level of the ground on
which she stood and took stock of his thinning hair and unshaven chin.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-020#84:1>
" Yeh Yeh needs a shave," she said and looked grave.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-020#85:1>
Unconsciously she had reproduced the very look her mother gave her
father each time she remarked that he needed a shave.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-020#86:1>
Her grandfather looked at her and wondered what business a girl like
her had to look so grave on a morning when every tree that they passed was
heavy with bloom.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-020#87:1>
What business furthermore had she to tell an old man that he needed
to get rid of the stubble around his chin?

<ICE-SIN:W2F-020#88:1>
" See those insects buzzing around the clump of pink flowers over
there?" he said, seeking to divert her attention away from himself.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-020#89:1>
" Insects," said the girl.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-020#90:1>
" Well, we call them bees," said the old man.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-020#91:1>
" Bees," said the girl.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-020#92:1>
" And do you know what bees do?"

<ICE-SIN:W2F-020#93:1>
" Bees do?" echoed the girl.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-020#94:1>
" Well ...er...they buzz," said the old man, desperately trying to
recollect what he had learnt about bees decades ago.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-020#95:1>
" Well they buzz," said the girl.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-020#96:1>
" And they make honey," said the old man, suddenly remembering more.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-020#97:1>
" They visit the flowers and they collect the nectar, and they bring
it to some hidden place - probably in the MacRitchie Forest - where the Queen
Bee lives, and ..."

<ICE-SIN:W2F-020#98:1>
He stopped and couldn't remember any more.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-020#99:1>
Or he was tired and didn't feel like probing deeper into the further
recesses of his memory.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-020#100:1>
He solved the problem by saying, " Yeh Yeh will buy Cai Yen a
picture book on bees."

<ICE-SIN:W2F-020#101:1>
Now the child wanted her grandfather to stop by at the piece of
parkland located between Soo Chow Drive and Soo Chow Walk.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-020#102:1>
Reluctantly Mr Lee agreed.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-020#103:1>
The child led the way, evidently having frequented the spot before.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-020#104:1>
She sat on a swing and had her grandfather give it a push.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-020#105:1>
The swing creaked forward and backward in synchrony to her giggles
and shrieks.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-020#106:1>
Mr Lee sat on a nearby swing not moving while observing his
grandchild's childish glee, his mind full of the spatterings of mauve petals
posed atop spreading boughs of vibrant green foliage, and of the petalled
softness disintegrating within the shaded circumference of every tree.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-020#107:1>
He had walked down Soo Chow Garden Road and had become suddenly
aware of another species of the Tabebuia which featured flowers of a very
pale shade - so pale that they looked almost white.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-020#108:1>
It had been a shock to learn of the existence of these taller trees
with flowers distilled to such paleness.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-020#109:1>
The white profuseness cast an air of dissonance to the scene.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-020#110:1>
Despite the pose of starry brilliance, the petals which showed not a
taint of colour seemed to him eerily sterile.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-020#111:1>
Cai Yen had got down from the swing and she now broke into his
thoughts by saying that she was hot.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-020#112:1>
Would her Yeh Yeh treat her to ice-cream at the ice-cream palace at
Thomson Plaza?

<ICE-SIN:W2F-020#113:1>
Mr Lee looked at her flushed chubby face, plump arms and legs, and
wondered whether the girl would grow to be ethereal.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-020#114:1>
With the young this was possible as a subject for contemplation ...

<ICE-SIN:W2F-020#115:1>
but with the old...?

<ICE-SIN:W2F-020#116:1>
Mr Lee wished that he could banish all thought of the spectre-like
whiteness that was causing so much unease.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-020#117:1>
It would be good to drown it all in a few scoops of ice cream.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-020#118:1>
They went to Swensen's and ordered strawberry ice cream for Cai Yen
and vanilla for himself.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-020#119:1>
When they reached home, his wife found out and was angry because the
ice cream would cause Cai Yen to lose appetite for the food she had prepared.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-020#120:1>
He sat through this bout of his wife's rantings during lunch.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-020#121:1>
It spoilt his appetite - he wondered whether she was aware.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-020#122:1>
But he kept quiet throughout in his usual disarming way and tried
counting his blessings.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-020#123:1>
That always helped when one had reason to be angry and didn't want
to lose one's temper.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-020#124:1>
He thought how fortunate he was to have such a wife who ran his
household and helped raise his children.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-020#125:1>
There were other outlets in life but she had resigned from her job
to attend to his needs even before the children came. <X>

<ICE-SIN:W2F-020#X126:1>
She was angry now, but her anger would soon cool and she would
probably feel guilty and treat him with extra tenderness.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-020#X127:1>
She would become more responsive to his needs and might even stay
up to watch the late night movie.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-020#X128:1>
Or he might persuade her to put on the cheongsam he had always
loved to see her wear.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-020#X129:1>
She might even let him help her put on the thick diamond ear studs -
he would be so gentle, she wouldn't even cry. </X> </I>
