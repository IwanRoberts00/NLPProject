<I>

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#1:1:A>
Oh no

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#2:1:B>
I don't know what to say now

<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#3:1:B>
We've exhausted everything

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#4:1:A>
I'm nervous

<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#5:1:A>
Ya

<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#6:1:A>
You've had to start since it's after all all your doing

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#7:1:B>
Has it started yet

<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#8:1:B>
It's started already

<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#9:1:B>
Oh no

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#10:1:A>
Well say something

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#11:1:B>
We had so much to say

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#12:1:A>
Ya

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#13:1:B>
We HAD so much to say

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#14:1:A>
I think uhm I wonder how sensitive this microphone is

<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#15:1:A>
Are we speaking too softly do you think

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#16:1:B>
I don't know

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#17:1:A>
Well speak up then

<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#18:1:A>
Okay so have you have you figured out how to uhm teach me how to
buy pork bones

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#19:1:B>
Oh no I forgot all about that

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#20:1:A>
Oh you forgot the recipe

<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#21:1:A>
Uhm

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#22:1:B>
Pork bones from Cold Storage

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#23:1:A>
Oh really

<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#24:1:A>
Just buy the pork bones

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#25:1:B>
I think so

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#26:1:A>
And then what do you do

<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#27:1:A>
Just dump it in hot just dump it in water and let it boil

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#28:1:B>
That's what I would do

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#29:1:A>
and then

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#30:1:B>
Uhm

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#31:1:A>
I mean how do you know it's ready

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#32:1:B>
Oh uhm I think it get it becomes frothy

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#33:1:A>
Oh then you have to some kind of scummy kind of frost rises to
the surface

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#34:1:B>
Ya and you'll you'll have to scoop off the scum and throw it
out

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#35:1:A>
Throw it out

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#36:1:B>
and you can put in other ingredients like

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#37:1:A>
So as long as it's frothing just scoop off all the froth

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#38:1:B>
Yeah

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#39:1:A>
and then what happens

<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#40:1:A>
And then it just keeps boiling and boiling

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#41:1:B>
Ya I I'm not sure

<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#42:1:B>
Maybe I've got to boil it for about two hours

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#43:1:A>
And then

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#44:1:B>
Uhm

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#45:1:A>
and then after you've skinned it all off what you have is pure
stock is it

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#46:1:B>
I think so

<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#47:1:B>
Ya ack oh

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#48:1:A>
Oh

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#49:1:B>
you'll probably add some spices your salt and all that ya

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#50:1:A>
Oh okay

<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#51:1:A>
Did you learn to cook before you were married

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#52:1:B>
Oh no I

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#53:1:A>
No oh

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#54:1:B>
don't think I even knew how to cook an egg

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#55:1:A>
Oh so when did you learn

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#56:1:B>
Uhm after I got married

<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#57:1:B>
No my husband is

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#58:1:A>
Both of you started to starve

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#59:1:B>
Fated to cook

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#60:1:A>
Oh

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#61:1:B>

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#62:1:A>
Oh your husband is a good cook

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#63:1:B>
Ya he's quite encouraging so he started off uh

<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#64:1:B>
Started off started me off on some recipes and then

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#65:1:A>

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#71:1:B>
Uhm

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#72:1:A>
It becomes a chore but actually cooking is so fun

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#73:1:B>
Ya

<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#74:1:B>
We used to cook in uhm almost everyday

<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#75:1:B>
I think maybe except for about two three nights a week

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#76:1:A>
Oh

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#77:1:B>
Ya before the kid came

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#78:1:A>
Oh but now your mother-in-law cooks for you

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#79:1:B>
No we just eat at her place once a week

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#80:1:A>
Oh that's right

<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#81:1:A>
You told me you would cook in bulk right

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#82:1:B>
Ya

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#83:1:A>
Oh

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#84:1:B>
Uhm uhm

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#85:1:A>
How about baby's food

<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#86:1:A>
What do you do

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#87:1:B>
Oh that's something brand new for us

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#88:1:A>
You actually cook you know or or just buy bottle

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#89:1:B>
Actually I'm still trying to figure out what's best for her

<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#90:1:B>
But last weekend we went out shopping and we got a crockpot

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#91:1:A>
Oh

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#92:1:B>
then we got a food processor

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#93:1:A>
Oh

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#94:1:B>
so we're going to try new stuff

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#95:1:A>
Oh no

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#96:1:B>
So that's my my my new interest

<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#97:1:B>
Cooking baby's food

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#98:1:A>
Oh ya I feel like getting a crockpot too

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#99:1:B>
Ya I think <unclear> word </unclear>

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#100:1:A>
Because I've heard it's ever so easy

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#101:1:B>
Uhm

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#102:1:A>
You can get a really nutritious meal

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#103:1:B>
Ya

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#104:1:A>
uhm and have it cooking while you're at the office

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#105:1:B>
Ya

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#106:1:A>
So

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#107:1:B>
That's right

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#108:1:A>
Unless you get an electrical fire in the meantime

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#109:1:B>
That's not likely

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#110:1:A>
So how uhm is this the first time you've started using a
crockpot

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#111:1:B>
Uhm it will be my first time

<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#112:1:B>
I haven't used it yet

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#113:1:A>
Using the crockpot

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#114:1:B>
Ya

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#115:1:A>
Uhm

<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#116:1:A>
Feel like getting one but my kitchen is so small

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#117:1:B>
Oh where're you living

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#118:1:A>
We're living at Pandan Valley

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#119:1:B>
Ya

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#120:1:A>
We just moved in a few days before Christmas last year

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#121:1:B>
Uhm uhm

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#122:1:A>
Ya we like it very much but uhm uhm no actually there are no
buts we actually do like it very much

<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#123:1:A>
I was just

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#124:1:B>
Is that your own place

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#125:1:A>
Ya we just bought it uhm last year

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#126:1:B>
Ya uhm

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#127:1:A>
Uhm oh now I know what I was trying to say

<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#128:1:A>
This thing threw me up and made me really nervous

<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#129:1:A>
I mean we like it very much but uhm sometimes we feel like we
don't get to enjoy it enough because uhm okay we're working the whole day
that's fine

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#130:1:B>
Ya

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#131:1:A>
you know everybody works the whole day

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#132:1:B>
Ya

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#133:1:A>
But then when we get back very often we have work to do still
so we're sort of

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#134:1:B>
Uhm

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#135:1:A>
Hunched over the Macintosh you know trying to type things out

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#136:1:B>
Ya

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#137:1:A>
Or you know so

<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#138:1:A>
Sometimes like the last weekend this weekend that just came and
went there was a chance for us to you know sit there and just enjoy being in
our own home

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#139:1:B>
Ya

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#140:1:A>
you know

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#141:1:B>
Like cooking

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#142:1:A>
Ya like cooking and just looking out the yard looking out the
window and the you know the lawn outside

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#143:1:B>
Uhm

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#144:1:A>
So we really enjoyed that a lot ya

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#145:1:B>
Ya

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#146:1:A>
But I guess it's not that bad lah to at least like your home
a lot

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#147:1:B>
Ya

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#148:1:A>
Even if you feel like you know

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#149:1:B>
Uhm

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#150:1:A>
You wish you had more chance to just sit there and enjoy it
rather than tearing around all the time trying to get things done

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#151:1:B>
Ya

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#152:1:A>
Anyway I must tell you about the first time I cooked for my
husband before we were married

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#153:1:B>
Uhm uhm

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#154:1:A>
Okay he was my boy-friend then

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#155:1:B>
Ya uh huh

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#156:1:A>
And what happened was it was so funny

<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#157:1:A>
I wanted to impress him and at that time I was in the States you
see

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#158:1:B>
Uhm

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#159:1:A>
So oh

<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#160:1:A>
Okay I bought cooking

<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#161:1:A>
I bought this book entitled uhm Chinese cooking A to Z or
step-by-step or something you know really simple

<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#162:1:A>
It was so funny I followed it practically step by step but took so
long to read each step and the similar instructions you know

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#163:1:B>
Uhm

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#164:1:A>
Before I went on to the next one that things just went crazy
like the first step was to heat up oil in the wok

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#165:1:B>
Ya

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#166:1:A>
and let the oil heat up before you throw in the garlic you
see

<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#167:1:A>
But I took so long reading the next few steps that the oil kept
heating until when I threw in the garlic the garlic simply went black

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#168:1:B>
Oh

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#169:1:A>
ya everything was terrible and I didn't know that you had to
separate broccoli into flowerets you know

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#170:1:B>
Uhm

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#171:1:A>
You have to slice off the stem

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#172:1:B>
Did you put the whole thing in

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#173:1:A>
I just I mean broke off great big chunks you know and I
didn't know you had to

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#174:1:B>
Yeah

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#175:1:A>
chop off the stalk <unclear> word </unclear> and there was
this great big green things you know uhm trying to cook

<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#176:1:A>
And I didn't know that it mattered which part of beef you bought
you see

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#177:1:B>
<unclear> word </unclear>

<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#178:1:B>
Uhm uhm

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#179:1:A>
which cut of beef for es especially for stir-frying

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#180:1:B>
ya

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#181:1:A>
you should try to buy steak

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#182:1:B>
Uh huh

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#183:1:A>
you shouldn't just buy cube beef or you know stewing beef

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#184:1:B>
Ya ya I'm not very good at that either

<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#185:1:B>
Uhm

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#186:1:A>
I've bought stewing beef which just because really tough the
whole time to stir-fry it

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#187:1:B>
Uhm

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#188:1:A>
So that was really a meal to remember

<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#189:1:A>
You know the broccoli was great big chunks the garlic was all
black

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#190:1:B>
So was he impressed

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#191:1:A>
and the beef what

<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#192:1:A>
He kept saying not bad not bad but I noticed he didn't eat very
much except for the rice

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#193:1:B>
Uhm

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#194:1:A>
Ya so but I've come a long way I think

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#195:1:B>
Ya what do you cook now

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#196:1:A>

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#199:1:B>
Uhm uhm

<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#200:1:A>
It's supposed to be a Cantonese dish you know but I haven't
uhm met any other Cantonese who who's heard of

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#201:1:B>
I bet it's a Cantonese dish in those easter uh no western
eastern type of cookbooks right

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#202:1:A>
Oh western eastern

<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#203:1:A>
Well it was written by a Chinese lady

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#204:1:B>
who's been at the west

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#205:1:A>
in the States for a long time

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#206:1:B>
Ya

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#207:1:A>
Well she claims it's a Cantonese dish

<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#208:1:A>
Anyway it tastes really nice

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#209:1:B>
Oh uhm

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#210:1:A>
It's just like stir-frying beef like you would uhm stir-fry
oyster sauce beef or anything

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#211:1:B>
Ya

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#212:1:A>
but uhm the seasoning is slightly different

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#213:1:B>
Uhm

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#214:1:A>

<ICE-SIN:S1A-019#X357:1:A>
