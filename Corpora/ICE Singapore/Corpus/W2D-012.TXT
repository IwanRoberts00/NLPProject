<h> Chapter Three </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2D-012#3:1>
<h> Calculating Your Budget ESTABLISHING WHAT YOU WANT </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2D-012#4:1>
The first consideration is to establish the extent of your renovation.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-012#5:1>
A precise precise plan of your needs has to be drawn up so that
miscommunication between the contractor and you is reduced.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-012#6:1>
Contractors may interpret inaccurate information to their advantage.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-012#7:1>
Renovation ideas can be sourced from friends, neighbours, magazines,
showrooms and exhibitions, interior designers, architects surveyors or
building surveyors.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-012#8:1>
These ideas can then be integrated with your basic requirements and a
sketch plan with annotations, dimensions and scale can then be drawn.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-012#9:1>
Together with your detailed description of the work to be done, the
scope of your renovation work can be identified.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-012#10:1>
Your concept has then to be adapted to obtain planning permission and
approval from the authorities.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-012#11:1>
Professional architects, surveyors and interior designers will be
required to advise on the planning and the suitability and cost of materials
and finishes that you want.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-012#12:1>
<h> ESTABLISHING A MAXIMUN And MINIMUM BUDGET </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2D-012#13:1>
Establishing a renovation budget is important and when doing so, you
have to determine what are your sources of funds and what can be obtained
from financial institutions.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-012#14:1>
You have to decide what percentage of your budget should be spent on
each room and on floor finishes, wall finishes and ceiling finishes.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-012#15:1>
Make an inventory of what is needed and fill in the prices which you
are prepared to pay.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-012#16:1>
You can then tailor your available funds.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-012#17:1>
A maximum and minimum budget has to be provided so that you have
flexibility and reallocation of funds is possible should there be a change in
priorities.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-012#18:1>
Think of ways to use what you already have in order to maximise your
budget.

<h> BUDGETING GUIDE TO RENOVATION COSTS </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2D-012#29:1>
Generally, there is a wide range of quality and prices for each type
of material.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-012#30:1>
For example, the price of ceramic tiles may range from
&dollar;30 to
&dollar;80 sq metre and marble
&dollar;120 to
&dollar;300 sq metre including installation.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-012#31:1>
Pattern work costs more than plain work.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-012#32:1>
Some types of wood, veneers and finishes for wardrobes and kitchen
cabinets are in the high cost range.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-012#33:1>
Thus, you must work out your budget accordingly.

<h> CHOOSING A GOOD CONTRACTOR </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2D-012#46:1>
Choosing a reliable contractor is covered in detail in Chapter Six.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-012#47:1>
Select several and check on their past performance with previous
clients.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-012#48:1>
Check if the contractors kept within the budget.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-012#49:1>
Confirm if the work was completed on time, whether they were
satisfied with the complete work and if there was supervision by the
contractors when the work was in progress.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-012#50:1>
Check if the contractors' offices are not just answering machines.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-012#51:1>
Remember each contractor must be given an identical specification and
renovation plan so that fair comparisons estimates is possible.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-012#52:1>
In addition, the contractors must conduct a thorough inspection of
your home.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-012#53:1>
Remember that quotation is normally the contractor's best estimate as
to how much the renovation will cost.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-012#54:1>
Be cautious if the contractor suggest that prices are " subject to
changes".

<ICE-SIN:W2D-012#55:1>
It is necessary to put your agreement in writing.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-012#56:1>
The contract should certainly include the date, contractor's name,
business address and licence number.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-012#57:1>
In addition, there must be drawings, complete job specifications,
starting and completion dates, guarantees, liability coverage, and a clause
to put the burden of cleaning up upon the contractor.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-012#58:1>
This is also covered in Chapter Seven and if you are employing a
professional advisor these matters should be attended to on your behalf.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-012#59:1>
<h> CASH FLOW AND CREDIT LIMIT </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2D-012#60:1>
Remember to check the terms of payment before signing the contract.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-012#61:1>
For cash flow control record all your payments and monitor them
according to your Budget Checklist.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-012#62:1>
Make payments at intervals while the work is in progress only as
stated in the contract and if you are satisfied with the work done so far.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-012#63:1>
It is best to pay by cheque so that you have a record of payment.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-012#64:1>
You should insist on a receipt with the contractor's name, address
and signature.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-012#65:1>
<h> VERIFYING ESTIMATES SUBMITTED </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2D-012#66:1>
Depending on the size of the job your professional advisor will
suggest you get at least 2 to 3 quotations for comparison.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-012#67:1>
In addition, the contractor should be required to break down the
project into components of work and unit rate.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-012#68:1>
An example of a simple house renovation estimate breakdown is as
follows: <X>

<ICE-SIN:W2D-012#X69:1>
1 New Extension structural works floor slab floor finishes 2
Internal painting wall ceiling 3 External painting wall 4 Kitchen cabinets
low cabinets m / m high cabinets m / m 5 Aluminium windows front windows side
windows 6 New flooring living room master bedroom bedroom 1 bedroom 2 toilets
7 Electrical work wiring
&dollar;/ point door bell new distribution board 8 Plumbing new pipe work fittings
bathtub - type sinks - type WCs type </X>

<ICE-SIN:W2D-012#70:1>
Based on the detailed quotation, check with neighbours or friends who
have done similar renovation work.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-012#71:1>
In addition, if the work fairly large and you have engaged an
architect, interior designer or quantity surveyor, they will check the
quotations with their records and advise you if the quotation is reasonable.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-012#72:1>
If you realise that you have exceeded your planned budget you may:

<ICE-SIN:W2D-012#73:1>
Get the contractor to do part of the job and do the rest yourself.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-012#74:1>
However, you will then have to coordinate the activities.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-012#75:1>
· Modify your needs by substituting materials that cost less.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-012#76:1>
Source relevant materials and adjust accordingly.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-012#77:1>
· Prioritize your renovation work so that inessential items may be
eliminated until you have enough funds.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-012#78:1>
· Schedule your work in several phases that cash flow is well
managed.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-012#79:1>
An example would be, laying the tiles for a room and then furnishing
it when more funds are available.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-012#80:1>
You have to assess the time that you have to complete your renovation
project.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-012#81:1>
Thus a target time frame has to be established and compared with
sources of funds available within the time frame.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-012#82:1>
<h> Chapter Four </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2D-012#83:1>
<h> Working With Professional Consultants </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2D-012#84:1>
Which professionals you should employ depend on the scale of your
renovation.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-012#85:1>
You may need to work with an architect, an interior designer, a
quantity surveyor, mechanical and electrical engineer, structural engineer,
land surveyor and a specialist.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-012#86:1>
<h> ARCHITECTS </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2D-012#87:1>
Architects are not only employed on commercial buildings and offices.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-012#88:1>
Some specialise in domestic projects.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-012#89:1>
You will require their services especially in drawing up plans for
the statutory authority and obtaining planning permission.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-012#90:1>
<h> What Does An Architect Do? </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2D-012#91:1>
· An architect brings together within the project all the elements
that are required by the client, taking into consideration the client's
lifestyle and preferences.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-012#92:1>
· The architect deals with statutory authorities and obtains planning
permission.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-012#93:1>
Sketches showing both the interior and exterior of the house are
provided for the client's approval before accurate drawings are submitted to
the relevant authorities.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-012#94:1>
The architect carries out the administration of the works from the
point of conceiving the project to the point where tenders are obtained.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-012#95:1>
Thereafter the architect checks the work on site and approves the
house before it is handed back to the owner.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-012#96:1>
The architect acts as a quasi-arbitrator who professionally advises
the client and the contractor when disputes arise.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-012#97:1>
<h> SELECTING AN ARCHITECT </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2D-012#98:1>
Referrals.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-012#99:1>
Ask your friends or neighbours who have used an architect and were
satisfied with the work for recommendations.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-012#100:1>
<h> Portfolios </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2D-012#101:1>
Shop around and look at the architect's past record.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-012#102:1>
Do you like his or her style?

<ICE-SIN:W2D-012#103:1>
Talk to the architect's old clients.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-012#104:1>
<h> Conversing </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2D-012#105:1>
Get to know the architect in person through conversation.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-012#106:1>
This is very important.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-012#107:1>
If you find that you cannot communicate well with the architect at
this stage, it is likely that you will not be able to convey your ideas when
the project starts.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-012#108:1>
Spend some time talking together and get a feel of how the architect
works.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-012#109:1>
Consider whether the architect's style suits you.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-012#110:1>
Singapore Institute of Architects.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-012#111:1>
If you cannot find an architect through personal recommendation or
you are not satisfied with the work of those architects you have seen, call
the Singapore Institute of Architects.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-012#112:1>
They will assist by channelling queries like this to the right
architect.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-012#113:1>
They will also send you upon request a list of names of architects
who specialise in the type of work you have in mind, or, you can always
consult a copy of the Institute's yearbook which lists the specialities of
the architects featured.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-012#114:1>
<h> What It Costs </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2D-012#115:1>
Fees for architects vary according to the type of work and the
extent of their involvement in your renovation work.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-012#116:1>
The Singapore Institute of Architects has laid down guidelines but
these are not mandatory.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-012#117:1>
The fees are mostly calculated as a percentage of the total building
cost.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-012#118:1>
There are basically three levels of complexity to a job.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-012#119:1>
The first level is simple renovation, the second is slightly more
complex work and the third, very complex work.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-012#120:1>
Renovation work will fall in between one and two.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-012#121:1>
If the renovation work costs approximately
&dollar;1 million, the guide provided by the Institute is about 8%.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-012#122:1>
And if renovation is between
&dollar;100,000 to
&dollar;200,000, the fees will be between 6% and 9%.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-012#123:1>
The SIA does not permit fee-bid amongst its members.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-012#124:1>
<h> STRUCTURAL ENGINEERS </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2D-012#125:1>
A structural engineer is concerned with structural safety and
strength of a building.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-012#126:1>
In renovation, the structural engineer's role is to see that the
existing structure of a building is strong enough to support any additional
load which may be required by the architect or the interior designer.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-012#127:1>
<h> What Does A Structural Engineer Do? </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2D-012#128:1>
· The structural engineer advises on foundations in areas where
there is likely to be subsidence.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-012#129:1>
He designs the main structural supports for your renovations.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-012#130:1>
· The structural engineer prepares calculations and drawings for
submission to relevant authorities for approval, calls for tenders and
periodically supervises building works.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-012#131:1>
<h> Selecting A Structural Engineer </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2D-012#132:1>
Through Other Professionals.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-012#133:1>
You may have to engage a structural engineer on the recommendation
of the architect or other professionals involved in the job.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-012#134:1>
This arrangement is advantageous as it permits architects or
professionals to team up with someone they have worked with before.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-012#135:1>
Association Of Consultant Engineers.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-012#136:1>
Approach the association for a recommendation if you require the
services of a structural engineer.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-012#137:1>
The association will be able to supply you with names of members
experienced in handling domestic works.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-012#138:1>
<h> What It Costs </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2D-012#139:1>
The fees vary with the type of work involved.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-012#140:1>
As a guide, work is usually charged on a percentage of the total
cost of the job.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-012#141:1>
The range is between 2% to 3% of the total renovation cost.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-012#142:1>
<h> INTERIOR DESIGNER </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2D-012#143:1>
Interior designers are not always trained in building design but may
have acquired the necessary skill through practice.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-012#144:1>
The more qualified ones are able to organise internal space and have
the visual skill and imagination to make an exciting and comfortable
interior.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-012#145:1>
The less qualified ones are only able to advise you on how to choose
decorative finishes and may not understand the organisation of space which is
fundamental to a comprehensive design.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-012#146:1>
<h> What Does An Interior Designer Do? </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2D-012#147:1>
· An interior designer advises on planning and reorgarusing of
internal spaces.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-012#148:1>
The designer makes sketches, prepares comprehensive colour charts
and compiles samples of materials for all rooms to be renovated.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-012#149:1>
· Assistance is given in the selection of fabrics, colour matching,
furniture and advice on storage and how to make best use of space.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-012#150:1>
· The interior designer will call for tenders from builders,
decorators, upholsterers and electrical contractors.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-012#151:1>
· The work on site is organised and periodically supervised.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-012#152:1>
The interior designer will check the progress of the project and
assess the standard of work done.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-012#153:1>
<h> Selecting An Interior Designer </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2D-012#154:1>
Shop Around.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-012#155:1>
There are several interior designers around.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-012#156:1>
Visit these firms and ask to see their work in photographs and in
reality.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-012#157:1>
Make a comparison and decide on what style you prefer.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-012#158:1>
Referrals.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-012#159:1>
Consult your friends and get recommendations from them.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-012#160:1>
Consult Interior Quarterly ( IQ) and Interior Digest ( ID) and other
design magazines.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-012#161:1>
<h> What It Costs </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2D-012#162:1>
Generally, the fees range from 10% to 15% of the total renovation
cost.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-012#163:1>
Designers at the higher end of the market will only accept a
renovation with a budget of at least
&dollar;150,000, but at the other end, there are designers who accept jobs with a
total renovation budget as low as
&dollar;50,000. </I>
