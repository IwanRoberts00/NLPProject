<h> <bold> Daring to dream </bold> </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-008#2:1>
<p> <smallcaps> IT </smallcaps> was a dream many thought Singapore's
political leaders were mad to try to pursue.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-008#3:1>
But that dream, that vision 30 years ago of transforming a colonial
trading post into a dynamic, industralised economy, is today an undeniable
reality.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-008#4:1>
Thirty years ago, Singapore, with a per capita income of barely
US&dollar;450, was desperate to create jobs for its unemployed masses.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-008#5:1>
Now the Republic boasts a per capita income of more than US&dollar;11,OO0 and
the planners worry about the long-standing labour shortage.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-008#6:1>
Playing a key role in turning that dream into humming factories and
busy offices has been the Economic Development Board.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-008#7:1>
The EDB set out to be a single-stop agency to attract the foreign
investor to Singapore and help him in every way possible to do business.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-008#8:1>
And in its single-minded pursuit of this goal, as Deputy Prime
Minister Lee Hsien Loong said last night at the board's 30th anniversary
celebration, the EDB helped the government to focus all its policies -
finance, education, communications, infra-structure development - to promote
growth.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-008#9:1>
It pushed hard to get the entire population of Singapore to go for
growth.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-008#10:1>
Government, unions, and employers all pulled in the same direction,
and the EDB can take pride in having, over the last 30 years, propelled
Singapore's economic development and its prosperity. </p>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-008#11:1>
<p> What is the board's role in the next lap?

<ICE-SIN:W2E-008#12:1>
BG Lee, who as Trade and Industry Ministry oversees the EDB,
last night outlined the three thrusts of the board's work in the years ahead.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-008#13:1>
Strength in specific niches, international reach, and high quality
labour - the key factors in keeping Singapore competitive.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-008#14:1>
The board's role, once predominantly to persuade foreign companies to
come to Singapore, now includes the challenge of helping Singapore companies
identify and grasp opportunities abroad so they can become world-class
players.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-008#15:1>
In pursuing this goal, cold logic demands that the effort and
resources available be allocated mainly to those companies with the best hope
of becoming Singapore MNCs. </p>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-008#16:1>
<p> But there must remain, alongside the logic and hard calculations, that
room for gambles, for dreams.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-008#17:1>
For small-scale entrepreneurs to turn to the EDB and other government
agencies for help in trying to turn their dreams, what might seem to be
wild dreams, into business success.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-008#18:1>
In the global competition for business, it may well be the Singapore
Inc approach that will give Singapore companies the best chance of success.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-008#19:1>
But Singapore Inc should not smother the small entrepreneur, for they
are integral to the Singapore economy.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-008#20:1>
This the EDB undoubtedly recognises, and when the Strategic Economic
Plan is unveiled in October, there will surely be measures designed to
help give local entrepreneurs a leg up the business world.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-008#21:1>
For Singapore needs all its players, big and small, to keep pushing
towards new horizons.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-008#22:1>
To dare to dream. </p> </I>

<h> <bold> Bridging those divisions </bold> </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-008#24:2>
<p> <smallcaps> BIRTHDAYS </smallcaps> are neat milestones in a life, as much
for nations as for people.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-008#25:2>
Singapore's 26th birthday today is especially notable because
it is the first National Day for the Goh Chok Tong government.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-008#26:2>
The last 26 years have been a success story for Singapore, so much so
that, as Mr Goh noted in his eve of National Day address last night, the
nation's problems are now the problems of affluence - obesity, controlling
the number of cars, and meeting the aspirations of a population
accustomed to rapid progress and high standards.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-008#27:2>
Prime Minister Goh said last night that he wants to build on the
track record of the past 26 years, and to sustain Singapore's economic
development and social progress. </p>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-008#28:2>
<p> Continued economic growth is fundamental to Singapore's future.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-008#29:2>
Without it, there will not be the social progress, the luxury of
other kinds of advancement - ever higher standards of education, healthier
and more varied lifestyles, greater freedom of choice, the finer things in
life generally.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-008#30:2>
This economic growth will be affected by developments external to
Singapore and beyond its control.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-008#31:2>
The world has been seen some dramatic changes in the last few years,
mostly for the better.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-008#32:2>
But there have been the unwelcome developments, such as the stalemate
in the GATT talks.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-008#33:2>
If this is unresolved and the world moves further towards
protectionism and trade blocs, Singapore's economic progress will be
made that much harder.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-008#34:2>
But good planning, strategic positioning.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-008#35:2>
and the right reflexes - by both the government and the people - will
help Singapore ride the economic ups and downs that may be ahead. </p>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-008#36:2>
<p> Much as steering the economy in the right direction will remain a
priority of the government under Mr Goh, the Prime Minister last night
said his main objective is <quote> people bonding </quote> - drawing
Singaporeans together in an extended family, in that sense of being part of a
whole.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-008#37:2>
This indeed is the critical task in the years ahead.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-008#38:2>
We are still in the process, intellectually and emotionally, of
defining 'the Singaporean'.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-008#39:2>
Race, religion, and language are still potentially problematic
issues.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-008#40:2>
There are other divisions that need to be bridged - between the
English-educated and the Chinese-educated; between socio-economic
classes.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-008#41:2>
And there is the growing need to answer the question of how a
national identity can be maintained in an increasingly borderless world.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-008#42:2>
These are the issues Mr Goh wants to address in the years ahead, for
it is in finding those bridges and answers that Singapore's continued success
lies.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-008#43:2>
This year's National Day theme is My Singapore.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-008#44:2>
It is an apt theme for the first National Day of Singapore's next
phase of development.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-008#45:2>
If more and more Singaporeans can make that declaration with
conviction, both intellectual and emotional, then Singapore should continue
to have many more good years ahead. </p> </I>
<I>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-008#46:3>
<h> <bold> Levelling, Singapore style </bold> </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-008#47:3>
<p> <smallcaps> OVER THE </smallcaps> next few weeks, or even months,
we may need to ponder deeply the meaning of Prime Minister Goh Chok
Tong's maiden National Day rally speech last Sunday.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-008#48:3>
Its full import may take some time to sink in.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-008#49:3>
But, sooner rather than later, it will be plain how major a landmark
his state-of-the-nation address will be in the evolution of Singaporean
society.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-008#50:3>
Mr Goh has always typified his leadership as one of continuity.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-008#51:3>
If change there must be, it is more in style.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-008#52:3>
Yet, he has been introducing policy shifts that are more of substance
than mere form.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-008#53:3>
Gradually, Mr Goh is emerging as a leader with his own mind.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-008#54:3>
The most indisputable evidence of this was the speech on
Sunday.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-008#55:3>
When have we heard a government leader talk so passionately about the
need to <quote> level up </quote> Singaporean society, balancing the elitist
face of Singapore with a more caring touch for the less able? </p>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-008#56:3>
<p> For 26 years, Singapore has been built on the foundation of the
meritocratic idealism of Mr Lee Kuan Yew.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-008#57:3>
The system that has been entrenched is one in which the best and the
brightest are nurtured.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-008#58:3>
The system has worked in the context of Singapore's needs, and has
become an inseparable part of the Singaporean identity.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-008#59:3>
But it has been tough.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-008#60:3>
And some have opted out, voting with their feet.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-008#61:3>
It is therefore a mark of bold resolve, and certainly of
leadership, on the part of Mr Goh to want to temper a system that has become the
anchor upon which Singapore has survived for 26 years.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-008#62:3>
It is yet another stamp of his emerging political personality that he
is doing this within a clear and coherent framework, steering the changes
through without rocking established norms in what is clearly a dualism of
change and continuity. </p>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-008#63:3>
<p> And so we are seeing, alongside present policies such as the Gifted
programme for the brightest of our children, a specific set of new
initiatives clearly designed to benefit the non-elites who form the bulk of
the nation; initiatives in three key areas - housing, education, and
health.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-008#64:3>
He is going to push home ownership to its limits.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-008#65:3>
He is opening up more opportunities in education for all, not just
the most able.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-008#66:3>
He is taking care of the health needs of Singaporeans who cannot
afford expensive hospitals.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-008#67:3>
Bringing them all together neatly, he describes his aim as that of
building a caring, extended Singaporean family.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-008#68:3>
Mr Goh has thought it all through.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-008#69:3>
He has stamped his brand of leadership on the Prime Minister's job,
and he now wants a clear mandate to proceed.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-008#70:3>
Mr Goh will be calling a general election soon.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-008#71:3>
With his popularity already so clear, Mr Goh's new thinking on the
policy front is likely to boost his standing, given the fact that there is so
little in his plans to fault.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-008#72:3>
Deciding whether or not to have him as Prime Minister is not going to
be a difficult choice. </p> </I>
<I>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-008#73:4>
<h> <bold> A greater stake in S'pore </bold> </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-008#74:4>
<p> <smallcaps> AS A </smallcaps> long-term investment, there are few
instruments that can beat property especially residential property,
in land scarce Singapore.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-008#75:4>
Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong's recent proposal to allow Housing Board
flat-owners to own private residential property is therefore a good one and
many Singaporeans are looking forward to a change in the rules. </p>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-008#76:4>
<p> The suggestion, which was put forward last Sunday at Mr Goh's first
National Day Rally speech as Prime Minister, will not only gladden the
hearts of HDB home owners but also property developers, as it comes at a time
when property prices are softening.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-008#77:4>
The Housing Board has, in fact, been gradually relaxing its
rules.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-008#78:4>
For instance, since August last year, private home owners have been
allowed to purchase HDB and HUDC flats in the resale market so long as they
comply with certain other conditions and live in these public flats. </p>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-008#79:4>
<p> Mr Goh's proposal will also be welcome news to those with tidy sums in
their Central Provident Fund accounts and looking around for suitable
investments.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-008#80:4>
While the CPF has relaxed its rules and allows the purchase of second
properties using savings with the board, HDB owners have not been able to
enjoy the full benefits without having to sell their flats.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-008#81:4>
They can, however, own commercial property - an anomaly to those who
argue that both commercial and residential properties are good investments in
the long run.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-008#82:4>
While HDB home owners can invest their CPF savings in gold,
commercial property and shares, including property shares, they cannot at
present use the money to buy private homes unless they quit their HDB flats.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-008#83:4>
Mr Goh's suggestion is therefore a logical expansion of the
investment options open to HDB home owners.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-008#84:4>
The condition that the investor should continue to live in his
Housing Board flat will ensure that the private property is an investment.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-008#85:4>
Further conditions should be attached to ensure that the private
property is a long-term investment and not just a short-term speculative
flutter. </p>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-008#86:4>
<p> While some may argue that those who can afford private homes should not
be allowed to own subsidised public housing, it must also be borne in mind
that the proposal will benefit, although not immediately, a majority of
Singaporeans as 87 per cent of the population live in HDB flats.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-008#87:4>
Also, as the HDB gradually reduces its subsidies and moves closer
towards market rates, this argument will hold less water.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-008#88:4>
Allowing HDB flat owners to buy private property without having
to quit their present abodes will help at least to maintain their HDB
property values as it should reduce the number of people putting up HDB
flats for resale.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-008#89:4>
If the HDB relaxes its rules on the purchase of private
property, this will not only offer to its tenants another investment option
but also a greater stake in Singapore. </p> </I>
<I>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-008#90:5>
<h> <bold> Openness must remain </bold> </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-008#91:5>
<p> <smallcaps> THE DUST </smallcaps> has begun to settle on what was
a watershed election.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-008#92:5>
A watershed not just because it produced three more opposition
members of parliament but because it was an election that saw Mr Goh Chok
Tong getting the endorsement of his prime ministership from
Singaporeans rather than just his People's Action Party colleagues.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-008#93:5>
And because it was an election Mr Goh fought on the strength of the
new style of government he believes Singapore now needs. </p>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-008#94:5>
<p> The post-election analyses vary as to what the result said of that
strategy of Mr Goh's, and indeed of his style. <X>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-008#X95:5>
In giving him 61 per cent rather than the 64 or 65 per cent of valid
votes he was looking for, were voters expressing their concern over
bread and butter issues such as rising living costs and missing
incense-burning bins?

<ICE-SIN:W2E-008#X96:5>
Was the working class voicing its frustration with its lot in life?

<ICE-SIN:W2E-008#X97:5>
Was the conservative segment of Singapore signalling its
distress at too rapid a move towards a liberal climate?

<ICE-SIN:W2E-008#X98:5>
Was this conservative segment primarily the Chinese-educated
who felt the PAP under Mr Goh, had ignored their views and concerns in its
eagerness to keep the English-educated happy? </p>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-008#X99:5>
It was, surely, a combination of all these factors, and more.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-008#X100:5>
The PAP leaders have, however, identified as a key factor the
surfacing of a tussle between the liberals and the conservatives, between the
English-educated and the Chinese-educated.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-008#X101:5>
A division, in other words, between those who heartily support Mr
Goh's open and more liberal style and those who fear what it might mean for
moral values, for the discipline and the order which have been hallmarks of
Singapore for so long.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-008#X102:5>
The three opposition candidates who defeated the PAP incumbents
were Chinese-educated, so it would appear that it was the Chinese-educated
conservative voters who were asserting their interests in this election.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-008#X103:5>
But much as the PAP government will want to find ways to renew its
feel for the Chinese ground and take into account the concerns of more
conservative Singaporeans when it makes policies, it will surely not want to
over-react.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-008#X104:5>
To interpret the election outcome from just one perspective and to
then shift into policies and approaches in line with this perspective wou1d
run the risk of alienating other segments of Singapore society.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-008#X105:5>
The fact is the conservative-liberal divide cuts across all
language and ethnic groups, and the voters who said 'yes' to the opposition
on Aug 31 did so for a variety of reasons.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-008#X106:5>
The Prime Minister has said he intends to press on with his open
style of government, though he will have to slow the speed of his changes and
make sure he has all segments of Singapore moving with him.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-008#X107:5>
This is reassuring.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-008#X108:5>
It is this openness, the participative kind of government that Mr
Goh and so many Singaporeans believe in, that Singapore needs at this stage
of its development.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-008#X109:5>
The tussle for attention between the conservatives and liberals,
between the many interest groups there are in Singapore - this is inevitable
at this point.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-008#X110:5>
Indeed it is a necessary and healthy part of the process of change,
of the transition from a centrally controlled polity to one where citizens
participate in the governing of their country.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-008#X111:5>
This transition requires more debate, a greater willingness by
Singaporeans to voice their views and to argue their case.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-008#X112:5>
It is from this lively debate and exchange of views that people
learn to understand and accept that there are other ways of looking at
issues, and to want to find ways to seek compromises and arrive at consensus.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-008#X113:5>
This is what participative government is all about, and what will
add to the long term stability of Singapore. </p> </X> </I>
