<h> INTRODUCTION </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-020#4:1>
The term " population policies" is usually used to refer to those
policies adopted by a government to influence the course of population trends
and patterns in the country.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-020#5:1>
( l) Some examples of such explicit population policies are
immigration policy regulating the inflow of people into the country,
mortality policy affecting the general health of the people, population
distribution or redistribution policy governing the movement of people within
the country, and fertility policy affecting the reproductive level of the
population.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-020#6:1>
There are two types of fertility policy - those designed to encourage
childbearing and those designed to discourage childbearing.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-020#7:1>
Those policies adopted by governments to persuade their people to
produce fewer children in order to lower the rate of population growth are
known as anti-natalist policies, while those meant to do the opposite are
known as pro-natalist policies.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-020#8:1>
The genesis of the national fertility policy of Singapore can be
traced to the election manifesto of the People's Action Party ( PAP) prepared
for the first general election held in May 1959.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-020#9:1>
According to this manifesto, the family planning arrangements then in
force were totally inadequate for the task of spreading knowledge among the
masses.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-020#10:1>
The PAP intended to expand the family planning organization
considerably so that it would effectively reach the people all over the
island.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-020#11:1>
( 2) The Family Planning Association ( FPA), which had earlier urged
the colonial government to play a direct role in providing family planning
services, repeated its call to the newly elected PAP Government to take over
its clinics.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-020#12:1>
The government, faced with problems of greater priority, refused to
do so, but played a more active part in the promotion of family planning.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-020#13:1>
Besides continuing the previous practice of providing an annual grant
to the FPA, the government permitted the Maternal and Child Health centres to
be used by the FPA to provide family planning services, participated actively
with the FPA in family planning campaigns, and in 1963 gave a valuable piece
of land at nominal rent to the FPA to build its headquarters.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-020#14:1>
The final phase in the development of a national fertility policy
occurred in March 1965 when the government appointed a three-man Review
Committee to look into the question of taking over the FPA's clinics.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-020#15:1>
( 3) The Committee's Report, submitted in June 1965, recommended the
government takeover of all except three of the clinics.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-020#16:1>
This led to the tabling of a White Paper on Family Planning in
Parliament in September 1965, accepting not only the recommendation of the
Committee but also proposing the introduction of a national population
policy.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-020#17:1>
( 4) In December 1965 the Singapore Family Planning and Population
Board Act, 1965 was enacted, according to which the Singapore Family Planning
and Population Board ( SFPPB) was duly established in June 1966.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-020#18:1>
( 5) The SFPPB was responsible for providing family planning services
to the general public up to May 1986 when it was closed down; since then
these services have been provided by the Ministry of Health in its Maternal
and Child Health centres.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-020#19:1>
The family planning programme under the management of the SFPPB and
subsequently the Health Ministry constitutes the principal component of the
population control programme.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-020#20:1>
The second component of the national programme of Singapore is based
on legalized voluntary sterilization.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-020#21:1>
( 6) The government was convinced that sterilization was a safe and
effective method of birth control, and legalized voluntary sterilization with
the enactment of the Voluntary Sterilization Act in November 1969.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-020#22:1>
( 7) Certain safeguards were, however, incorporated in the
legislation.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-020#23:1>
With the successful operation of the Act in the first few years, the
government further liberalized the performance of sterilization by removing
some of the more rigid conditions through the Voluntary Sterilization (
Amendment) Act, 1972 in May 1972.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-020#24:1>
The final step was taken in December 1974 when the new Voluntary
Sterilization Act, 1974, which repealed the previous Act, came into
operation.(8) Since then, voluntary sterilization has been made easily
available to women and men at their request.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-020#25:1>
The number of sterilizations performed in 1988 was 4,500, bringing
the total for the whole nineteen-year period to 112,568.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-020#26:1>
The third component of the population control programme is centred on
induced abortion which was legalized at the same time as voluntary
sterilization.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-020#27:1>
( 9) Induced abortion was first permitted under very strict
conditions in accordance with the Abortion Act, 1969, which came into force
in March 1970.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-020#28:1>
( 10) As compared with voluntary sterilization, the legalization of
induced abortion attracted considerable debate and some opposition among the
general public.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-020#29:1>
By and large, the strict conditions and supervision imposed by the
Act ensured the satisfactory provision of induced abortion to women without
any major problems in the early 1970s.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-020#30:1>
In due course most of the restrictions were removed in December 1974
with the enactment of the new Abortion Act, 1974, repealing the previous Act.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-020#31:1>
( l1) Thereafter, induced abortion has been widely provided in
government hospitals and private clinics to pregnant women on demand.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-020#32:1>
In 1988 the number of induced abortions amounted to 22,000, bringing
the total since 1970 to 288,666.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-020#33:1>
The fourth component of the national family planning programme
measures has been introduced at various times since the late 1960s.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-020#34:1>
These measures are the restriction of maternity leave to the first
three children only from August 1968 and later for the first two only from
August 1973; the change from a standard flat-rate accouchement fee to
progressively higher rates for higher birth orders in August 1969; the
restriction of normal child relief in income tax returns to the first three
children born on or after 1 August 1973; the elimination of the point system
for Housing and Development Board apartments based on number of children in
August 1973; and the according of priority in the annual Primary One
registration exercise up to the third child only in 1973 and the second child
only from 1976.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-020#35:1>
Various incentives aimed at promoting voluntary sterilization were
also introduced.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-020#36:1>
These are paid maternity leave for female civil servants who undergo
sterilization after the birth of the third or higher order birth, seven days
unrecorded full-pay leave for civil servants after sterilization, the
reimbursement of accouchement fee after sterilization, and priority in the
Primary One registration for children with one sterilized parent.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-020#37:1>
The various components of the population control programme briefly
outlined above have been modified and improved over the years.(12) The
comprehensive and strong fertility policy, coupled with rapid social and
economic development, has resulted in the spectacular decline in fertility
from the high level in 1957 to the replacement level in 1975, and below this
level until the present.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-020#38:1>
The city state of Singapore has indeed become quite well known for
its effective fertility policy and its rapid transition from a high level to
a low level of fertility.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-020#39:1>
In 1984 Singapore attracted further attention when it introduced some
eugenic measures with the specific aim of improving the quality of the
population.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-020#40:1>
However, these measures did not prove to be popular among certain
sections of the community and did not address the more urgent problem of
below-replacement fertility.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-020#41:1>
It was not until 1987 that changes to the national fertility policy
were made, relaxing some of the old anti-natalist measures and introducing a
few pro-natalist measures.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-020#42:1>
Whilst the development of the national fertility policy has been
fully presented in earlier publications ( l3), this occasional paper will be
devoted to a detailed discussion of the major changes introduced in 1984 and
1987.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-020#43:1>
<h> 1984 FERTILITY POLICY CHANGES </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-020#44:1>
<h> Reasons for changes </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-020#45:1>
The origin of the first major changes to the national fertility
policy of Singapore may be traced to the traditional National Day message
delivered by the Prime Minister, Mr Lee Kuan Yew, to a gathering of People's
Action Party members and other specially - invited guests on 14 August 1983.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-020#46:1>
A large part of his speech was devoted to the differences in
fertility according to the educational background of mothers as indicated by
the 1980 Population Census data and to the findings of some researchers which
appeared to show that the intelligence of a child is determined more by
nature than by nurture.(l4) He expressed concern about the lop-sided
procreation pattern in which the lesser-educated women were producing too
many children while the better-educated were having too few since this would
have the adverse effect of lowering the quality of the population in the long
run.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-020#47:1>
He also said, " Therefore, we must further amend our policies, and
try to reshape our demographic configuration so that our better-educated
women will have more children to be adequately represented in the next
generation." The full text of his speech is reproduced in Appendix A.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-020#48:1>
His remarks in the National Day address, normally confined to matters
of national importance, provoked a great debate in the mass media about the
validity of the hypothesis that the intelligence of children is inherited,
that the mother's educational attainment is the principal determinant of a
child's intelligence, and that intelligence is dependent more on nature than
nurture.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-020#49:1>
( l5) As to be expected, there was no general consensus on these
somewhat controversial and emotional issues.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-020#50:1>
After several months of public discussion on the lop-sided
procreational pattern of Singapore, the government made changes to the
fertility policy in early 1984 with the aim of improving the quality of the
population.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-020#51:1>
The year 1984 ushered in a new phase in the demographic history of
Singapore when for the first time the qualitative aspect of the population
was taken into consideration in the modification of the national fertility
policy.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-020#52:1>
<h> Primary school registration </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-020#53:1>
The first change aimed at encouraging more births from better
educated women was announced on 24 January 1984 in relation to the primary
school registration exercise for children commencing school in January
1985.(l6) The registration exercise was first introduced in 1972 to provide
an orderly system of school admission in the face of excessive demand for
Primary One places, particularly in the more popular schools.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-020#54:1>
In an effort to strengthen the national fertility policy, the
government had taken the opportunity to incorporate anti-natalist measures
restricting priority to the first two children and to children with one
parent who had since been sterilized.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-020#55:1>
The announcement of the pro-natalist eugenic policy in early 1984
again provoked considerable public discussion, mainly on the grounds that it
was unfair to give children of better-educated mothers an advantage over
those of lesser-educated mothers.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-020#56:1>
The amendments to the primary school registration to accord priority
to children with better-educated mothers are outlined in Figure 1.
