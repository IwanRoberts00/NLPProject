<h> LANGUAGE AS LINGUA MENTALIS </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-005#6:1>
Any attempt to study human phenomena ( whether they are of a
linguistic, psychological, sociological, political or cultural nature) is
immediately confronted by their tremendous variety.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-005#7:1>
Over the years, the human or social sciences have attempted to use
various theoretical-methodological approaches to make sense of this apparent
diversity.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-005#8:1>
How then should one deal with the countless variety of social,
cultural, linguistic and political forms ( be they elements of thought,
action or behaviour) manifested by different groups, communities or
societies?

<ICE-SIN:W2A-005#9:1>
What theoretical foundations might one construct to account for this
variety?

<ICE-SIN:W2A-005#10:1>
Are there objective measures to determine their qualitative status
vis-d-vis a given set of existential circumstances?

<ICE-SIN:W2A-005#11:1>
If so, how may such objective measures be constructed?

<ICE-SIN:W2A-005#12:1>
To complicate matters, approaches to the study and understanding of
human phenomena are sometimes distorted by extraneous factors such as for
example political beliefs, ideology and sheer ethnocentrism.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-005#13:1>
To some extent, this is unavoidable because a scholar or researcher
doing cross-cultural studies normally looks at another language, society or
culture from the vantage point of his own cultural background.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-005#14:1>
He has in other words, an already built-in bias, whether this reveals
itself in his work is a matter for him to resolve.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-005#15:1>
On the other hand, a scholar or researcher studying his own language,
society or culture does not necessarily ensure full objectivity either.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-005#16:1>
He may fall into error of another sort, that of seeing only the
strengths or achievements of his society and ignoring the unpalatable or
uncomplimentary.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-005#17:1>
As a specifically human phenomenon, language exemplifies a
bewildering variety.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-005#18:1>
On the one hand it is universal or common to all societies and yet on
the other it is unique to the set of socio-historical circumstances
associated with its community of speakers.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-005#19:1>
Language is so extensive and deep-rooted in the human psyche that it
is not difficult for many to imagine its close identity with thought.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-005#20:1>
Every person is said to think in and express himself through a
language.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-005#21:1>
The tendency to equate thought with language has a history that goes
back to ancient times.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-005#22:1>
In a famous passage from Plato, Socrates had raised the question
concerning the thought process.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-005#23:1>
Theaetetus was said to have replied that, " when the mind is
thinking, it is simply talking to itself".

<ICE-SIN:W2A-005#24:1>
It would appear, therefore, that Plato was inclined to treat thinking
and talking alike and that when one talks, one implies the use of language.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-005#25:1>
Therefore, to Plato, thought was merely the nominalisation of the
verb to think.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-005#26:1>
Over the years, others were to echo Plato's standpoint and among the
most prominent in recent times was Ludwig Wittgenstein.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-005#27:1>
First of all, Wittgenstein like Berkely, Hobbes and Russell before
him was primarily interested in philosophy an explanatory science.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-005#28:1>
Thus according to him, philosophy aims at the logical clarification (
klarung) of thoughts.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-005#29:1>
A philosophical work consists essentially of elucidations (
erlaute-rungen).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-005#30:1>
Philosophy does not result in 'philosophical propositions', but in
the clarification ( klarwerden) of propositions.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-005#31:1>
In the first of his two major philosophical works, the Tractatus
Logico-Philosophicus, Wittgenstein attempted to solve the problem of the
relation between language and the structure of the world, in other words,
between the meaning of a linguistic symbol and the meaning of the object or
thing it purports to represent.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-005#32:1>
Ordinary language as he put it did not conduce toward clarity of
thought ( and by implication elucidate the real meaning of meaning) because
of its many diverse uses and extraneous embellishments.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-005#33:1>
Therefore to understand how the world is constituted, one has to
discover the basic structure of meaningful language.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-005#34:1>
Only by doing this can philosophical clarifications of the structure
of the world have validity.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-005#35:1>
It can be seen that Wittgenstein was concerned mainly with the
problem of philosophical discourse which implicitly involved the use of
language.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-005#36:1>
The clarity of philosophical explanation or the elucidation of a
philosophical problem depended directly on a language meeting certain basic
logical conditions.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-005#37:1>
Therefore to answer the question 'What constitutes meaningful
discourse?' he developed what has become known as the 'picture theory' of
language.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-005#38:1>
The 'picture theory' of language as expressed in the Tractatus
Logico-Philosophicus contains a number of logical assumptions.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-005#39:1>
In essence, language is regarded as a totality of propositions.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-005#40:1>
A proposition is said to have meaning if only if it is a picture of
reality or is a description of a state of affairs.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-005#41:1>
A word or a name is said to mean the object or the object its
meaning.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-005#42:1>
Going on to elaborate his basic standpoint, Wittgenstein explained
that to understand the world implies the clarification of one's world or the
structure of one's language.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-005#43:1>
His philosophy of language therefore, rests on the premise that
language and the structure of world ( reality) are similar.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-005#44:1>
The essence of a language, in terms of its basic propositions
reflects the essence of the structure of the world.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-005#45:1>
Thought, according to him, is not possible without language.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-005#46:1>
Since language directly relates to thought, any limitation inherent
in the former would affect accordingly the realisation of the latter.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-005#47:1>
His theory of meaning rests on the categorical stance that the
meaning of a word lies in its use or alternatively the meaning of a word is
its use in the language.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-005#48:1>
Though Wittgenstein was mainly concerned with the problem of
philosophical explanation, his writings on the relation between language and
thought and language and meaning have tremendous implications for both the
theory and practice of linguistic science.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-005#49:1>
It is quite possible that his philosophical ideas might have
influenced to some extent at least, the writings of subsequent scholars, in
particular Noam Chomsky and Benjamin Lee Whorf though in different ways as we
shall see later.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-005#50:1>
At this juncture, several important points need to be made so as to
provide some perspective to the discussion.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-005#51:1>
First of all, Wittgenstein in his writings implicitly differentiated
between two forms of language viz., the language of everyday use and the
language of philosophy.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-005#52:1>
Though such a differentiation is made for the purpose of achieving
explanatory clarity, both forms of language in effect share the same
linguistic structure.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-005#53:1>
Indeed, the language of philosophy is derived directly from the
language of everyday use.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-005#54:1>
However, in making the differentiation Wittgenstein posed an
important problem for studies on language development viz., whether the
language of science for instance necessarily differ from the language of
normal discourse cognitively, and if so in what way.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-005#55:1>
Secondly, Wittgenstein's reaffirmation of the Platonic standpoint
that thought is not possible without language cannot be accepted without the
necessary qualifications.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-005#56:1>
Ontogenetically, language and thought have different genetic roots.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-005#57:1>
Studies of children and their development have shown that language
development and thought development follow different paths at the initial
stage.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-005#58:1>
In the phylogeny of thought and language, a prelinguistic phase in
the development of thought and a preintellectual phase in the development of
language are clearly discernible.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-005#59:1>
The two are structurally and functionally different from each other.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-005#60:1>
However, the two systems ( language and thought) merge to become one
at a critical period of the child's growth process where upon language
becomes rational and thought verbal.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-005#61:1>
There are essentially two critical aspects arising from the
foregoing.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-005#62:1>
Wittgenstein's insistence that thought and language are similar does
emphasise the importance of language in formal thought processes.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-005#63:1>
In this connection, the influence of language is cumulative in
intellectual pursuits.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-005#64:1>
In other words, in the more esoteric spheres of human activity ( e.g.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-005#65:1>
the use of language in the sciences, in legal practice, and in
certain categories of creative writing) the use of language is governed by
the need to achieve communicative effectiveness.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-005#66:1>
In essence this means ( as in the case of the sciences including the
drafting of legal documents) the transmission of meaning intention and ideas
through the use of concepts embodied in language.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-005#67:1>
Understood in this way, thought ( or its realised concrete form 'concept')
and language overlap and assume a unitary existence.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-005#68:1>
This aspect of language and thought have particular relevance for
this study because the primary striving associated with the development of
new terminologies in Malay is to formulate concepts which are equivalent to
those use in developed modern languages such as English.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-005#69:1>
This implies in effect, that the structuring of a concept in Malay
takes into consideration certain semantic values or alternatively cognitive
elements.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-005#70:1>
At least it would imply the adequate matching of cognitive elements
found in English and Malay to achieve a satisfactory conceptual outcome.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-005#71:1>
It can be seen therefore, that in language development of the kind
discussed, the linguistic component ( word, phrase or sentence) must fit the
conceptual component.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-005#72:1>
More pertinent however is the fact that in developing new
terminologies the use of language to afford conceptualisation ( or delineate
reality and human experience is pursued formally as it is governed by such
criteria as: preciseness, absence of ambiguity, accuracy and economy.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-005#73:1>
An important corollary is the fact that concepts and thought are able
to meet the aforementioned criteria only if they are socio-culturally
pertinent while at the same time retaining a reasonable degree of stability.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-005#74:1>
Finally, Wittgenstein failed to address certain related issues in
order to grasp the multi-dimensionality of meaning in language.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-005#75:1>
The term 'meaning' has t~ components: the denotative and the
connotative, the latter would include the historical, socio-cultural and
ideological elements that influence the semantic status of a word, in other
words its cognitive character.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-005#76:1>
To arrive at meaning therefore, requires an adequate appreciation of
both the denotative and connotative components which in turn implies an
understanding of the structure of the world which language is supposed to
describe; the nature of symbolism; the psychology of knowing, understanding,
and meaning; and finally, the theoretical-philosophical premises marshalled
to explain it.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-005#77:1>
However, Wittgenstein's insistence that the meaning of a word must be
sought in its use points to a fundamental fact about language viz., that
meaning should be understood in terms of what it does - pragmatics.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-005#78:1>
It is a view of language that is best exemplified in Malinowski's
theory of meaning.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-005#79:1>
Equally important was Wittgenstein's suggestion that language implies
rules and that it is the rules that give it its internal logic.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-005#80:1>
Wittgenstein's philosophical interpretation of language serves as a
useful starting point for a more detailed examination of the various
substantive issues raised.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-005#81:1>
In order to do this the contribution of linguists will be given
attention first.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-005#82:1>
A systematic examination of their views about the nature of language
will help to elucidate the problem of cognition at a later point.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-005#83:1>
The single most important theoretical construct that has influenced
the science of linguistics is no doubt the 'structuralism' of Ferdinand de
Saussure.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-005#84:1>
Structuralism is " a scientific description of language in terms of
relations between units, irrespective of any properties which may be
displayed by these units".

<ICE-SIN:W2A-005#85:1>
It seeks to discover linguistic relationships or configurations
whether they involve sounds or meanings " not on the surface but below and
behind empirical reality".

<ICE-SIN:W2A-005#86:1>
According to de Saussure, speech or language exists as a sum of
impressions on the one hand and a mass of heterogeneous speech facts on the
other.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-005#87:1>
It would be impossible to account for every individual variation.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-005#88:1>
Therefore, in order to set the correct path for linguistic enquiry,
one has to differentiate between the specific or personal idiosyncrasies of
speech exemplified by a speaker ( la parole) and the norms or rules governing
the use of speech ( la langue).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-005#89:1>
The former is " the executive side" of speech and is characterised by
variation, such variations being due to physiological differences relating to
the production of speech.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-005#90:1>
The latter, on the other hand, " is both a social product of the
faculty of speech and a collection of necessary conventions that have been
accepted by a social body to permit individuals to exercise that faculty".

<ICE-SIN:W2A-005#91:1>
'La parole' is equated with speech whereas 'la langue' ( which is
characterised by homogeneity, concreteness, and stability) is equated with
language.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-005#92:1>
The proper subject of study, according to de Saussure should be 'la
langue' which as he defines it, " is a system of signs in which the only
essential thing is the union of meanings and sound-images, and in which both
parts of the sign are psychological." <X>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-005#X93:1>
His differentiation between 'la parole' ( the individual aspect or
speech) as against 'la langue' ( the social aspect or language) sets to
identify language in its two contrasting yet mutually interdependent
components. </X> </I>
