<I>

<ICE-SIN:S2A-001#1:1>
Rashid has uh until recently won five important titles including the
sixth Star Malaysia open twice beating ah coincidence well beating team mate
Foo Kok Keong in both finals

<ICE-SIN:S2A-001#2:1>
And he's strongly tipped to win this title tonight to make it with
repeat of luck

<ICE-SIN:S2A-001#3:1>
Uh <unclear> word </unclear> over Foo Kok Keong with three games four
fifteen fifteen eleven fifteen five and uh Kok Keong narrowing things seven
ten

<ICE-SIN:S2A-001#4:1>
Again Kok Keong part of the wrong foot unfortunately which I think had
been pushed within too far on the far side uh to uh Kok Keong's left and he
watched it as it he fell fell out of play and the he wins another point

<ICE-SIN:S2A-001#5:1>
It's now two points uh he's two points behind at eight ten

<ICE-SIN:S2A-001#6:1>
Well Rashid with one more of his cross court chops and uh Foo Kok
Keong scrambles for that one fell in the process uh and causing the his side
of court to to be wet with his perspiration

<ICE-SIN:S2A-001#7:1>
Got it wiped and uh well he's a bit cross his court to Rashid Shidek
ten eight

<ICE-SIN:S2A-001#8:1>
A fine rally between these players and uh it is a very aggressive
Rashid Shidek against the very game Foo Kok Keong

<ICE-SIN:S2A-001#9:1>
Rashid using a lot of smashes and in many cases the leaping smash
which is uh usually associated with the the players from Indonesia and China

<ICE-SIN:S2A-001#10:1>
Well Rashid is uh moving into very good effect but uh Foo Kok Keong
is returning almost everything that comes at him another one of those cross
court chop by Rashid this time it's a cross court chop by uh Foo Kok Keong
but uh a little too deep and it falls out of play and uh Rashid moves on one
point more

<ICE-SIN:S2A-001#11:1>
Eleven eight Rashid is the top seed in this tournament of Malaysia

<ICE-SIN:S2A-001#12:1>
The number two seed Bangbang Supiato knocked out by Foo Kok Keong in
the quarter-final

<ICE-SIN:S2A-001#13:1>
Ponpamadi of Indonesia the third seed knocked out by Foo Kok Keong in
the semi final

<ICE-SIN:S2A-001#14:1>
Ah that's that's good defending and that ends centre court returns
and Rashid he's fairly quick off the mark and he slams it down very hard and
the he moves on to twelve twelve eight

<ICE-SIN:S2A-001#15:1>
Yuko Suprianto another Indonesian support seat who was ousted by
Rashid Sidek in the semi-finals

<ICE-SIN:S2A-001#16:1>
Uh Foo Kok Keong is the fifth to eighth seeds and then comes
<unclear> word </unclear> of Thailand Kim Han Kue of Korean Ang Jay Chiang of
Korea

<ICE-SIN:S2A-001#17:1>
So now it's the first seat against the fifth to eighth seed in the
final of this nineteen ninety-two Seiko Asian Championship

<ICE-SIN:S2A-001#18:1>
Well Rashid returns the favour has that ball floating quarter court
and uh Kok Keong is under that one and he picked his spot and sent it down
very firmly to win service

<ICE-SIN:S2A-001#19:1>
Eight twelve another beating smash from Rashid's and taken by Kok
Keong scrambling taking it

<ICE-SIN:S2A-001#20:1>
That's the kind of player he is and his time is over unfortunately
for the stroke's that he's returned is the most difficult one this was a
breeze but he finally sent it into the net and the well the service crosses
court now again and it's Rashid Sidek with service

<ICE-SIN:S2A-001#21:1>
Twelve points to eight three points away from this first game in the
Men's Singles Final

<ICE-SIN:S2A-001#22:1>
One more point for Rashid which makes it easier or does it

<ICE-SIN:S2A-001#23:1>
He's two points away from this first game and uh he's probably
wondering where that little extra comes from Foo Kok Keong

<ICE-SIN:S2A-001#24:1>
He's very quick his strive has gone beyond the reach of Foo Kok Keong

<ICE-SIN:S2A-001#25:1>
Rashid Sidek and now he's got one more point before he wins wraps up
this first game at fourteen eight now serving to Foo Kok Keong

<ICE-SIN:S2A-001#26:1>
It's time the cross court keeping smash from Rashid to Kok Keong's
right falls out of play and service is in the hands of Foo Kok Keong Eight
fourteen

<ICE-SIN:S2A-001#27:1>
Rashid fumbled the return and Kok Keong collects one more point

<ICE-SIN:S2A-001#28:1>
It's nine fourteen and the you've probably be hear grunting
reminiscent of the Monica Phyllis in ten tennis or the Jimmy Connors

<ICE-SIN:S2A-001#29:1>
Foo Kok Keong doing the grunting there every shot he attempts Just
<unclear> word </unclear> service to Rashid Sidek fourteen nine

<ICE-SIN:S2A-001#30:1>
Will Rashid wrap up this first game

<ICE-SIN:S2A-001#31:1>
Fourteen nine

<ICE-SIN:S2A-001#32:1>
He does wrap it up

<ICE-SIN:S2A-001#33:1>
Rashid didn't realise but uh it probably falls out of court and so he
wins his first game at fifteen nine

<ICE-SIN:S2A-001#34:1>
Rasid Shidek winning the first game fifteen nine against Foo Kok
Keong in this Men's Singles Final of the Seiko Asian Badminton Championship
and uh well you can expect a lot more good badminton from these two players
comes the second game in just a moment

<ICE-SIN:S2A-001#35:1>
Both sides of the court being mopped down because you can just
imagine the perspiration from these two players

<ICE-SIN:S2A-001#36:1>
The pace that they're playing at and uh looking at the two of them I
would say that uh Rashid is definitely the fitter of the two

<ICE-SIN:S2A-001#37:1>
Now what's going to happen in the second game

<ICE-SIN:S2A-001#38:1>
Now let's watch it Love all Rashid Sidek serving to Foo Kok Keong

<ICE-SIN:S2A-001#39:1>
Rashid is very quick on the return and uh here again he demonstrates
that uh agility of his he returns that one very quickly and uh he beats Kok
Keong and wins his first point in the second game

<ICE-SIN:S2A-001#40:1>
One love Rashid

<ICE-SIN:S2A-001#41:1>
A loud call from the linesman calling the ball out

<ICE-SIN:S2A-001#42:1>
Two love Rashid leading Foo Kok Keong in the second game

<ICE-SIN:S2A-001#43:1>
That was much too hard

<ICE-SIN:S2A-001#44:1>
The fast court net return by Foo Kok Keong falls out of court towards
the umpire

<ICE-SIN:S2A-001#45:1>
Henry Ee of Singapore and uh Rashid collects another point three love

<ICE-SIN:S2A-001#46:1>
With that grunt according <unclear> word </unclear> smash by Foo Kok
Keong wins him service love three

<ICE-SIN:S2A-001#47:1>
Amazing how Foo Kok Keong scrambles for the shot goes on all force
and is eager to get up again to retrieve the next shot

<ICE-SIN:S2A-001#48:1>
And here the rally in progress after that uh one attempt where he
goes sprawling but getting to the shuttle and he wins his point here in after
this long rally

<ICE-SIN:S2A-001#49:1>
One three Foo Kok Keong trading Rashid Sidek

<ICE-SIN:S2A-001#50:1>
This time this time he's beaten

<ICE-SIN:S2A-001#51:1>
Similar situation he goes on all force again but doesn't reach the
shuttle

<ICE-SIN:S2A-001#52:1>
That chop again the deadly chop from Rashid Sidek beating him to Kok
Keong's right and the service is over now to Rashid Sidek

<ICE-SIN:S2A-001#53:1>
Three one Rashid on your cam on your screen now

<ICE-SIN:S2A-001#54:1>
Shuttle test both players happy with it and service now from Rashid
three one

<ICE-SIN:S2A-001#55:1>
This is one of those shots that uh quite often work for Foo Kok Keong
the back end drop shot but uh in this instance it didn't quite work and the
Rashid moves along four one

<ICE-SIN:S2A-001#56:1>
Five one and the umpire was there right at that spot to see the
shuttle fall out of play the return from Foo Kok Keong

<ICE-SIN:S2A-001#57:1>
Five one

<ICE-SIN:S2A-001#58:1>
Very well executed overhead uh drop shot by Foo Kok Keong and uh
following the return by Rashid uh cross court net return attempt by Kok Keong
doesn't make it and uh Rashid moves on to six

<ICE-SIN:S2A-001#59:1>
Six one

<ICE-SIN:S2A-001#60:1>
Foo Kok Keong winning this duel at the net and uh winning service
over at one six

<ICE-SIN:S2A-001#61:1>
He has to do something if he is going to make a fight of it in this
second game

<ICE-SIN:S2A-001#62:1>
He's five points behind here again another of his drop shot <unclear>
word </unclear> love

<ICE-SIN:S2A-001#63:1>
Love by the two players

<ICE-SIN:S2A-001#64:1>
Love again two players loving

<ICE-SIN:S2A-001#65:1>
This is taking everything out of them Stop shot by Rashid

<ICE-SIN:S2A-001#66:1>
Again love Kok Keong up court shot but out of place and Kok Keong
wins one more point six two two to Kok Keong and six to Rashid Sidek

<ICE-SIN:S2A-001#67:1>
The topping would be the strokes that would take everything out of
the two players

<ICE-SIN:S2A-001#68:1>
Again Rashid making use of his height and that deadly uh cross court
drop of his cross court chop uh to win that service and he's leading six two

<ICE-SIN:S2A-001#69:1>
Again we see Kok Keong stretching right down to retrieve the shuttle

<ICE-SIN:S2A-001#70:1>
He gets it across and uh Rashid makes the mistake of sending the
shuttle out of lane and uh Kok Keong gets back service at two six

<ICE-SIN:S2A-001#71:1>
And uh it's almost ten thirty-five in Kuala Lumpur as we witness the
Men's Singles Finals between the two Malaysians Rashid Sidek and Foo Kok
Keong

<ICE-SIN:S2A-001#72:1>
Kok Keong collecting another point narrowing down to three points
three six

<ICE-SIN:S2A-001#73:1>
An overhead cross court return by Kok Keong falls out of court and uh
he concedes service to Rashid Sidek six three

<ICE-SIN:S2A-001#74:1>
Another long bogging rally rally between the two players and uh Kok
Keong attempted and he falls into and he sends the ball into the net and uh
Rashid moves along to seven

<ICE-SIN:S2A-001#75:1>
Seven Rashid three Kok Keong

<ICE-SIN:S2A-001#76:1>
Rashid was ready for those returns from Kok Keong and the he was at
uh punish them and uh he sent the shot shuttle away from uh Kok Keong's reach
and he moves on to nine

<ICE-SIN:S2A-001#77:1>
Nine three nine three

<ICE-SIN:S2A-001#78:1>
Another shuttle change while Kok Keong request that he be allowed to
tie his shoe laces

<ICE-SIN:S2A-001#79:1>
Nine three Rashid leading and uh we have to look at the way things
went uh in last year's final this went to three but uh from the way things
are going at this point uhm doesn't seem likely to be that way but uh
anything can happen

<ICE-SIN:S2A-001#80:1>
Just as uh Kok Keong is just proven he is one service over at three
nine

<ICE-SIN:S2A-001#81:1>
He's six points behind and uh it's really tough to get six points
because at this stage he's looking a very very tired man and the Rashid still
playing very aggressively

<ICE-SIN:S2A-001#82:1>
Very very deep net shot returned by Rashid Shidek

<ICE-SIN:S2A-001#83:1>
Hit the net court lightly and fell very deep for Kok Keong and Kok
Keong had nothing else to do but uh watch it beat him all the way

<ICE-SIN:S2A-001#84:1>
Again I think attempting to return that shot from uh Rashid Shidek
that trope shot from Rashid Shidek

<ICE-SIN:S2A-001#85:1>
He keeps his racket to the shuttle gets gets it there but uh shuttle
that didn't quite make it over the net and uh service is back with Rashid at
ten three or rather he Rashid wins the point ten three

<ICE-SIN:S2A-001#86:1>
He just move his service three ten seven points for Kok Keong to make
up ground lost ground

<ICE-SIN:S2A-001#87:1>
<unclear> word </unclear> returned to Kok Keong

<ICE-SIN:S2A-001#88:1>
Rashid smashes it

<ICE-SIN:S2A-001#89:1>
Kok Keong gets to it and sends it out of court and uh Rashid gains
back service at ten three

<ICE-SIN:S2A-001#90:1>
Ten three Rashid Sidek leading Foo Kok Keong

<ICE-SIN:S2A-001#91:1>
Exellent play from the two players and unfortunately Kok Keong had to
send it back and return out of court giving away another point to Rashid
eleven three

<ICE-SIN:S2A-001#92:1>
I think it will be quite correct to say that uh Rashid sets his
victory he's eleven point and Kok Keong three

<ICE-SIN:S2A-001#93:1>
That's eight point ahead

<ICE-SIN:S2A-001#94:1>
Kok Keong he hit walks after the shuttle and watches it fall and it
falls in court

<ICE-SIN:S2A-001#95:1>
It's now twelve three three points away from victory and another
mistake by Kok Keong pushing the shuttle a little too hard

<ICE-SIN:S2A-001#96:1>
Out of court and one more point for Rashid Sidek

<ICE-SIN:S2A-001#97:1>
Thirteen three

<ICE-SIN:S2A-001#98:1>
He's two points away from the title

<ICE-SIN:S2A-001#99:1>
The Asian Badminton Championship crown

<ICE-SIN:S2A-001#100:1>
One more mistake from Foo Kok Keong and uh Rashid's almost there

<ICE-SIN:S2A-001#101:1>
He's almost there

<ICE-SIN:S2A-001#102:1>
Fourteen three

<ICE-SIN:S2A-001#103:1>
A very weary Foo Kok Keong technically if he puts up a fight as he
attempts fight back

<ICE-SIN:S2A-001#104:1>
I'm always a long way off but uh he's known to put everything into
his match and who knows

<ICE-SIN:S2A-001#105:1>
That's it

<ICE-SIN:S2A-001#106:1>
Foo Kok Keong he's up on this and Rashid comes away with a defeating
uh victory defeating that victory he he had over Foo Kok Keong in nineteen
ninety-one

<ICE-SIN:S2A-001#107:1>
Fifteen nine

<ICE-SIN:S2A-001#108:1>
Fifteen three

<ICE-SIN:S2A-001#109:1>
Rashid Sidek beating Foo Kok Keong of Malaysia the victor

<ICE-SIN:S2A-001#110:1>
Foo Kok Keong the vanquished and the score fifteen nine fifteen
three <X>

<ICE-SIN:S2A-001#X111:1>
Well there's only one more match remaining on tonight's card and
this will be the Double Final between the Chinese player of Chen Yu Min and
Wang Zhang Zong against the Malaysian pair Rashid Sidek and Jalan Sidek </X>
