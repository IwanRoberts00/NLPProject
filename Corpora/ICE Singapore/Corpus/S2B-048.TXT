<I> <X>

<ICE-SIN:S2B-048#X1:1> And now we'd like to cross over to the Singapore
Conference Hall for a press conference by the Prime Minister

<ICE-SIN:S2B-048#X2:1> Well the votes are now in and in a short
while our Prime Minister Mr Goh Chok Tong will begin a
post-election press conference </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S2B-048#3:1:A>
Yes good morning ladies and gentlemen

<ICE-SIN:S2B-048#4:1:A>
I called this election to seek an endorsement for my leadership my
style of government and my program

<ICE-SIN:S2B-048#5:1:A>
The results showed that while the voters have given the PAP the
mandate to govern Singapore they have not given me the clear endorsement I
have hoped for

<ICE-SIN:S2B-048#6:1:A>
In terms of popular votes the PAP has 61% which is 2.2% less than
the 63.2 won in 1988

<ICE-SIN:S2B-048#7:1:A>
I hoped for a better improvement over the last uh election results

<ICE-SIN:S2B-048#8:1:A>
In other words I was hoping for a percentage point higher than the
63.2% that did not come about

<ICE-SIN:S2B-048#9:1:A>
In the process we have also lost 3 good MPs including 2
office-holders are Ng Pock Too Suraimy and Tan Guan Seng

<ICE-SIN:S2B-048#10:1:A>
We also lost a promising new candidate Andy Gan

<ICE-SIN:S2B-048#11:1:A>
I am proud of them they worked hard they campaigned hard

<ICE-SIN:S2B-048#12:1:A>
I'm sorry to have lost them in this election

<ICE-SIN:S2B-048#13:1:A>
In a developed country the results that we had would be considered
a landslide victory but we are not a developed country

<ICE-SIN:S2B-048#14:1:A>
After the solid progress in the last three years that is the last
election and having put in quite a lot of effort in terms of policies and
programs for the benefit of the people in particular my style of trying to
reach out to Singaporeans to build a consensus

<ICE-SIN:S2B-048#15:1:A>
I've hoped for a solid endorsement to strengthen my political
position to carry out the changes I have spelt out

<ICE-SIN:S2B-048#16:1:A>
That solid endorsement did not come

<ICE-SIN:S2B-048#17:1:A>
I will have to study the detail results

<ICE-SIN:S2B-048#18:1:A>
Reflect over them to understand their meaning and then to decide
whether and how to continue with my open consultative style of government

<ICE-SIN:S2B-048#19:1:A>
Personally I'm disappointed that I got to perhaps modify my style
of government

<ICE-SIN:S2B-048#20:1:A>
I'm reluctant to do so cos' that's my personality

<ICE-SIN:S2B-048#21:1:A>
That's something which I believe in

<ICE-SIN:S2B-048#22:1:A>
I still would like to pursue the style of government but obviously
since I did not get a strong endorsement for this I would have to make
modifications to my style

<ICE-SIN:S2B-048#23:1:A>
Besides my leadership the major issue which arose in this election
was the use of gut feelings of race and religion in Singapore gut feelings of
race and religion in Singapore

<ICE-SIN:S2B-048#24:1:A>
Jufrie Mahmood Workers' Party candidate for Eunos GRC made use of
communal and religious tools to win Malay votes

<ICE-SIN:S2B-048#25:1:A>
I took a strong stand against him

<ICE-SIN:S2B-048#26:1:A>
I felt very strongly that that is a wrong way to campaign and that
if you allow one candidate to do so other candidates would follow very
quickly and this will lead to big trouble

<ICE-SIN:S2B-048#27:1:A>
The Workers' Party and SDP decided/united in it became abundantly
clear during the election campaign that the Eunos results would be seen as I
put it during the campaign

<ICE-SIN:S2B-048#28:1:A>
A test case as to whether the people of Singapore or in this case
the people of Eunos condone a communal approach to politics or reject it

<ICE-SIN:S2B-048#29:1:A>
Well the PAP won in Eunos but by a very small margin

<ICE-SIN:S2B-048#30:1:A>
I find it incomprehensible that on this basic issue we should win
only by a small margin

<ICE-SIN:S2B-048#31:1:A>
It shows that many voters in Eunos GRC have not understood the
gravity of communal politics

<ICE-SIN:S2B-048#32:1:A>
The danger this trend holds for Singapore

<ICE-SIN:S2B-048#33:1:A>
I'm deeply concerned for the implications for the future shape of
politics in a multi-racial Singapore

<ICE-SIN:S2B-048#34:1:A>
Over several days we argued openly over this fundamental issue that
in elections no candidate should use communal religious pulls to work on the
gut feel of race and religion

<ICE-SIN:S2B-048#35:1:A>
I cannot understand the results in Eunos GRC even though we won and
I'm fearful of what it portends for Singapore in the future

<ICE-SIN:S2B-048#36:1:A>
But what is clear is that the strategy of Mr Chiam See Tong has
worked

<ICE-SIN:S2B-048#37:1:A>
Mr Chiam See Tong used a strategy that the PAP was given the
mandate to govern and that this was a by-election

<ICE-SIN:S2B-048#38:1:A>
And because he succeeded in focussing voters' minds on the fact
that this was a by-election the attitude of the voters changed

<ICE-SIN:S2B-048#39:1:A>
And that attitude changed on the validity of nomination when you
returned back a government

<ICE-SIN:S2B-048#40:1:A>
He asked them to vote for the opposition and from the results you
could that wherever there were plausible or wherever there were credible
candidates or even possible ones the voters decided to vote for them

<ICE-SIN:S2B-048#41:1:A>
There is now a proper opposition in parliament and Mr Chiam can
rightly claim to be its leader

<ICE-SIN:S2B-048#42:1:A>
He will be the leader of the opposition in parliament

<ICE-SIN:S2B-048#43:1:A>
The ground rules have changed

<ICE-SIN:S2B-048#44:1:A>
Those who are opposed to the government can now have the official
opposition to work through the PAP self-imposed opposition role is now over

<ICE-SIN:S2B-048#45:1:A>
In other words PAP MPs have no further need to play opposition in
parliament

<ICE-SIN:S2B-048#46:1:A>
This role will be taken over by Mr Chiam and his opposition members
of parliament

<ICE-SIN:S2B-048#47:1:A>
Like government parliamentary parties in other Commonwealth
countries the PAP's role will now be that of a conventional governing party
in a two-party political partisan situation

<ICE-SIN:S2B-048#48:1:A>
This is a new situation

<ICE-SIN:S2B-048#49:1:A>
I've seen in the cam campaign that if we lose ten seats and our
percentage falls below 55% that life will not be as before

<ICE-SIN:S2B-048#50:1:A>
Life cannot go on as before

<ICE-SIN:S2B-048#51:1:A>
That was what I said during the election campaign

<ICE-SIN:S2B-048#52:1:A>
We did not lose ten seats we did not lose 8% of the votes from the
last time

<ICE-SIN:S2B-048#53:1:A>
But in my view life cannot be as before

<ICE-SIN:S2B-048#54:1:A>
Certain things have to change

<ICE-SIN:S2B-048#55:1:A>
Now how they will change I do not know tonight but I feel that
politics in Singapore cannot go on as before

<ICE-SIN:S2B-048#56:1:A>
It's a new situation now

<ICE-SIN:S2B-048#57:1:A>
We have to face this

<ICE-SIN:S2B-048#58:1:A>
I myself am of course personally disappointed but nevertheless it
is still quite a relief that the results were what they were

<ICE-SIN:S2B-048#59:1:A>
It could have been worse

<ICE-SIN:S2B-048#60:1:A>
Now I'll take on some questions

<ICE-SIN:S2B-048#61:1:A>
Will you want to say a few words in uh Mandarin

<ICE-SIN:S2B-048#62:1:A>
Uh I think maybe say a few words in Mandarin say a few words in
mandarin if you want to

<ICE-SIN:S2B-048#63:1:A>
You're good in Chinese

<ICE-SIN:S2B-048#64:1:A>
I'm not good in Chinese

<ICE-SIN:S2B-048#65:1:A>
Put it in Chinese

<ICE-SIN:S2B-048#66:1:A>
Uh just one minute I think I would uh ask my colleague to say a few
words in Mandarin <X>

<ICE-SIN:S2B-048#X67:1:A>
Ong Teng Cheong spoke in Mandarin </X> </I>


<I>

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S2B-048#68:2:B>
The Next Lap sets out what we want Singapore to be in the next
generation

<ICE-SIN:S2B-048#69:2:B>
My government will translate these long-term goals into immediate
programs so that Singaporeans will be better off by the end of this term of
Parliament Standards of living have risen rapidly in Singapore

<ICE-SIN:S2B-048#70:2:B>
Jobs have been plentiful

<ICE-SIN:S2B-048#71:2:B>
Nearly everyone owns his own home complete with telephone and
television

<ICE-SIN:S2B-048#72:2:B>
CPF and POSB savings have gone up

<ICE-SIN:S2B-048#73:2:B>
Standards of health care have risen

<ICE-SIN:S2B-048#74:2:B>
More students are making it to secondary schools and into
polytechnics and universities

<ICE-SIN:S2B-048#75:2:B>
All this has been achieved because sound government policies have
created a framework for sustained growth and enable Singaporeans to progress
and prosper

<ICE-SIN:S2B-048#76:2:B>
But we are only half-way up to becoming a developed country

<ICE-SIN:S2B-048#77:2:B>
The more difficult half remains ahead of us

<ICE-SIN:S2B-048#78:2:B>
We can only get there as one united nation Singaporeans naturally
compete to do well individually and get ahead

<ICE-SIN:S2B-048#79:2:B>
But we must also work together to succeed as a group and to
strngthen the bonds among us

<ICE-SIN:S2B-048#80:2:B>
We must encourage the more able to do their best for themselves and
for Singapore

<ICE-SIN:S2B-048#81:2:B>
But the more able must also need to show concern for the others and
help them to catch up

<ICE-SIN:S2B-048#82:2:B>
We should level up to progress not level down to stagnate

<ICE-SIN:S2B-048#83:2:B>
The government will play an essential role It will reward drive and
enterprise and give each Singaporean the incentive to excel

<ICE-SIN:S2B-048#84:2:B>
It will invest heavily in educaiton and human resources so that
each one can acquire the right knowledge and skill be self-reliant and earn
more

<ICE-SIN:S2B-048#85:2:B>
The government will also to build up the assets of Singaporeans by
upgrading and increasing the value of their HDB homes

<ICE-SIN:S2B-048#86:2:B>
This will give every citizen a share of the wealth we have created
together and strengthen his stake in Singapore

<ICE-SIN:S2B-048#87:2:B>
However while the government will subsidize investments like
education and infrastructure it will not subsidize consumption expenditure

<ICE-SIN:S2B-048#88:2:B>
To do so is to undermine the traditional virtues of thrift personal
responsibility and the will to achieve and to weaken our economy

<ICE-SIN:S2B-048#89:2:B>
The experience of other countries has proved this again and again

<ICE-SIN:S2B-048#90:2:B>
Education is the foundation of competitiveness

<ICE-SIN:S2B-048#91:2:B>
It is not eh one of exercise but the life-long process as we
acquire new knowledge and skills to keep up with new technology and adapt to
new economic changes

<ICE-SIN:S2B-048#92:2:B>
School results have steadily improved as we raise teaching
standards and refine the education system

<ICE-SIN:S2B-048#93:2:B>
Demand for higher education has increased

<ICE-SIN:S2B-048#94:2:B>
The Institute of Technical Education will be formed this year to
train not only fresh school leavers but older workers who want to upgrade
their skills and their jobs

<ICE-SIN:S2B-048#95:2:B>
A fourth polytechnic will be set up this year

<ICE-SIN:S2B-048#96:2:B>
NUS and NTU have increased their intakes and will expand further as
more qualified students graduate from schools

<ICE-SIN:S2B-048#97:2:B>
The Singapore Open University will admit students starting this
year to give adults who missed out on a tertiary education a second chance to
work for university degrees

<ICE-SIN:S2B-048#98:2:B>
Education is an investment in our people

<ICE-SIN:S2B-048#99:2:B>
We must invest more in our most promising students while looking
after the needs of the less able

<ICE-SIN:S2B-048#100:2:B>
In schools we need to give parents a wider range of choices so
that their children can receive the education best tailored to their
individual needs

<ICE-SIN:S2B-048#101:2:B>
This is the rationale for the independent schools and the Edusave
scheme

<ICE-SIN:S2B-048#102:2:B>
We need to develop the independent schools into outstanding
institutions to give the most promising and able students an education
matching their promise

<ICE-SIN:S2B-048#103:2:B>
Admission to these schools must be based principally on merit not
ability to pay

<ICE-SIN:S2B-048#104:2:B>
No bright child from a poor home need lose his chance to study in
an independent school

<ICE-SIN:S2B-048#105:2:B>
There'll be scholarships and bursaries for him

<ICE-SIN:S2B-048#106:2:B>
Attention paid to independent schools will not be at the expense
of the other schools

<ICE-SIN:S2B-048#107:2:B>
Instead the other schools will benefit from ideas tested out
successfully in the independent schools

<ICE-SIN:S2B-048#108:2:B>
By demonstrating what is possible the independent schools will
help other schools to raise standards

<ICE-SIN:S2B-048#109:2:B>
The government will widen the Edusave scheme to achieve these
objectives

<ICE-SIN:S2B-048#110:2:B>
It had previously announced that every year the scheme will
contribute a sum to the Edusave account of each individual student

<ICE-SIN:S2B-048#111:2:B>
In addition Edusave will now fund two types of scholarships

<ICE-SIN:S2B-048#112:2:B>
One scholarship will be for top pupils going to independent
schools

<ICE-SIN:S2B-048#113:2:B>
They will be chosen based on academic merit from among the best
students in the country regardless of family background

<ICE-SIN:S2B-048#114:2:B>
One quarter of the pupils in independent schools will receive such
scholarships which will cover the school fees

<ICE-SIN:S2B-048#115:2:B>
The second type of scholarship will be for students going to
nonindependent secondary schools

<ICE-SIN:S2B-048#116:2:B>
This scholarship can be awarded on the constitutuency or school
basis to grassroots organizations and school advisory or management
committees

<ICE-SIN:S2B-048#117:2:B>
In this way good students in many schools and not just the
outstanding students in independent schools will be recognised and encouraged
to put in their best efforts

<ICE-SIN:S2B-048#118:2:B>
Besides awarding scholarships Edusave will also make annual grants
to government and government-aided secondary schools

<ICE-SIN:S2B-048#119:2:B>
The schools will have discretion to use these grants for example
to hire extra specialist staff for additional equipment like computers or for
bursaries to help needy students

<ICE-SIN:S2B-048#120:2:B>
They can be equipped more like independent schools

<ICE-SIN:S2B-048#121:2:B>
To fund these new schemes the annual Edusave contribution to
individual accounts will be correspondingly reduced

<ICE-SIN:S2B-048#122:2:B>
Nearly every Singaporean now owns the home he lives in

<ICE-SIN:S2B-048#123:2:B>
The government will refurbish and upgrade the older HDB estates to
approximate the quality of newer estates like Pasir Ris and Bishan <X>

<ICE-SIN:S2B-048#X124:2:B>
Demonstration projects will be launched later this year If they
are popular with residents HDB will upgrade other neighbourhoods which want
to do so over the next ten to fifteen years Meanwhile we can make many
improvements to existing estates to spruce up common areas and improve
essential facilities for example by water-proofing bathroom floors These
investments will enhance the value of HDB homes and increase the assets of
Singaporeans Many Singaporeans living in HDB flats wish to upgrade to private
housing Government will sell more land to private developers for condominiums
and landed property developments Besides homes HDB has also built many
shophouses but so far it has only sold a few of them to the shopkeepers As
landlord HDB has periodically needed to raise the rents of these shophouses
causing difficulties to some tenants To solve these problems HDB will sell
most of these shophouses to the tenants The price will be related to the
market values of the properties with an appropriate discounts This will
enable the shopowners to paln ahead with certainty One area of concern to
Singaporeans is health care as incomes rise and the population ages the
demand for medical care will inevitably go up As wages of medical staff go up
so will costs so will national expenditure on health care This has happened
in every country sorry Singapore's per capita income is only half that of the
United States and Japan Yet the subsidised wards of government hospitals
already offer better medical care than most Japanese hospitals Lower income
Singaporeans enjoy medical care than many American families who cannot afford
medical insurance and have no access to good hospitals The government will
ensure that all Singaporeans receive bais medical care It will continue to
subsidise B2 and C class wards though it will still have to revise charges
for the wards from time to time There is a limit to the level of medical care
which the government can guarantee every citizen The state cannot afford
unlimited subsidies for high technology medicine especially treatments which
are recently discovered and not yet established Every dollar spent on these
areas is a dollar less for other proven basic and cost-effective procedures
Patients who want non-standard treatments will have to pay for them at
non-subsidised rates or depend on the private sector Governments which ahve
provided free medical care for their citizens like Canada Britain Spain and
other devloped countries more affluent than we are all face serious
difficulties Sweden after seventy years of state welfare plans to reform its
system of governmentfunded free health care Even communist China intends to
start charging government employees for medical care No state can meet the
insatiable demand for health care The burden of the ever increasing
expenditures ultimately falls back on the people We must learn from these
painful experiences of other countries Our medical care system must create
maximum incentive for responsibility and minimum temptation to waste The
individual has a personal responsibility to keep fit stay healthy minimise
the need for medical treatment and save for his own medical expenses The
first report from the Review Committee on national health policies emphasised
preventive medicine and healthy living The government has accepted this
report and will launch an annual national campaign for healthy lifestyles
this year We have restructured government hospitals to provide medical care
more efficiently and economically The trend is for the private sector to play
a bigger role in providing health care and competing against government
hospitals as it haas done in obstetrics More than half the babies in
Singapore are born in private hospitals Singaproeans who have Medisave have
generally been able to meet their medical expenses especially if they also
have Medishield But the self-employed are not covered by Medisave The
government will extend Medisave to as many self-employed workers as possible
In the long-term the Medisave contirbution rate of six percent will be
insufficient The government will raise Medisave contribution rates
progressively especially for older Singaporeans who have already got their
homes The government will set up a new endowment fund called Medifund to
complement Medisave Income from the endowment will be used to help poorer
Singaporeans whose Medisave accounts are insufficient to meet their medical
expenses and who need help as a last resort Medifund will be an extension of
the existing scheme of fee waivers for C and B2 class wards This will provide
a safety net for Singaporeans Help from Medifund will not be an entitlement
Each application to Medifund will be assesssed individually by a committee
involving community leaders to decide how much help is needed Inkeeping with
the principle of personal responsibility Medifund will give priority to
helping those who have consistently contributed to their own Medisave
accounts This will be an additional incentive for self-employed Singaporeans
to contribute to Medisave For older Singaporeans who retired before Medisave
was fully introduced Medifund will be more flexible The changes in Singapore
society had been rapid Sometimes people feel disorientated and have to
struggle to keep up But the pace of change is not dictated by Singapore alone
The entire Asia-Pacific region is undergoing dramatic change Other countries
like South Korea Taiwan Malaysia and Thailand are advancing even more rapidly
than Singapore and catching up on us If we choose a more relaxed pace we must
be prepared to be overtaken and left behind To stay ahead we must constantly
restructure and upgrade Sustaining growth depends on pursuing efficient
market-oriented economic policies People sometimes these policies for paying
inadequate attention to social and human factors But these are the very
policies which have created the prosperity we enjoy today The communist
countries pursued the opposite policies ignoring market forces and
eliminating income differences by government order They created poverty and
despair Many have collapsed The government cannot hold back change but it
will help Singaporeans to adapt to change It cannot protect local businesses
against foreign competition but it will help them to restructure and compete
It cannot preserve redundant jobs where technology or market demand has
changed but it can help affected workers to retrain and find new jobs While
we constantly upgrade and adjust the changing world conditions we must not
unthinkingly cut ourselves off from our cultural roots Government policies
must always enjoy the broad support of the major social groups including the
less vocal non-English speaking part of our society Now that the economy is
more developed growth is becoming more difficult Despite our best efforts the
economy will slow down Where previously eight percent growth was normal in
the next phase five to seven percent growth will be very good While we work
harder to upgrade and become more productive so must also moderate our
expectations of wage increase In recent years wages have been increased by as
much as ten percent per year but this cannot be sustained over the long-term
The labour market is still tight but eventually wages will have to slow down
to match productivity and economic growth Otherwise we'll be we will be
chasing our own tails and higher wages will cause higher inflation without
improving standards of living Implementing policies to carry Singapore
forward in the next lap depends on an efficient and professional civil
service which can attract and challenge some of the most able Singaporeans to
contribute their best to Singapore The present civil service arrangements for
recruiting promoting and managing personnel centred on the Public Service
Commission and the Public Service Division were inherited from the colonial
government The arrangements are over-centralised and too rigid to cope with a
rapidly changing labour market They give more weight to internal civil
service relativities between unrelated vocations than to fault the market
judges the jobs to be worth despite periodic salary revisions the civil
service is unable to recruit all the talent it needs and pay them market
rates In Britain the civil service commission has delegated most of its
authority to ministries and departments and retain responsibility for only
fifteen percent of recruitment Malaysia which inherited similar arrangements
as ours has amended its constitution to delegate civil service promotions to
ministries The Malaysian PSC is only responsible for recruitment We must make
fundamental changes to the management of the Singapore Civil Service and free
up its personnel administration The public sector must become a more
responsive and competitive employer without compromising the integrity and
impartiality of the civil service and the statutory boards We are entering a
new phase of Singapore's devlopment We have successfully overcome the basic
challenges of the firts twenty-five years of independence schools housing
security jobs and basic health care We have built up substantial reserves and
created an elected presidency with powers to give some protection to these
reserves Now we face new challenges How to strengthen national consensus
despite the absence of visible danger How to remind Singaporeans that the
basics have not changed however secure our prosperity may appear How to
remain agile and keen even though we are no longer lean and hungry How to be
a meritocratic but not an individualistic society How to maintain the pace of
upgrading so that Singapore will become a developed country and all will be
better-off by the end of the century The new generation of Singaporeans must
find fresh answers to these challenges amidst tumultuous international
changes </X> </I>
