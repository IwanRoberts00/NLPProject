<h> Abstract </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-033#8:1>
The unsatisfactory performance of reinforced and prestressed concrete
structures is emphasized in this article.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-033#9:1>
The causes and symptoms of defects in buildings in association with
these undesirable performance are identified and appropriated remedial action
are prescribed to allow or to prevent the occurrence of such defects.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-033#10:1>
<h> Introduction </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-033#11:1>
Structure is the part of a building responsible for the bearing and
transmission of loads.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-033#12:1>
It is generally analogous to the skeleton which carries a human body.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-033#13:1>
Considering the numbers of buildings which had been successfully
designed, constructed and remained functionable until to-date, there were
relatively few known cases of failures.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-033#14:1>
Indeed, any failure, particularly accompanied with losses of lives
and properties, frequently caused intensive public outcry irrespective of
whether it was an act of nature or due to human negligence.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-033#15:1>
Although structural concrete is a relatively durable form of
construction, the material in its constituent forms ie concrete and steel,
are, by all means, not entirely maintenance free.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-033#16:1>
Comparing to steel structures, there have been relatively more cases
of unsatisfactory performance of concrete structures during and after the
completions of the construction works.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-033#17:1>
In some newly completed structures, strengthening and stiffening
works are required to eliminate defects caused by errors of design and
constructions.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-033#18:1>
Whilst in some other cases, major and minor repairing works have to
be undertaken to counteract the effects of normal deterioration.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-033#19:1>
It is also not uncommon that specialised techniques of strengthening,
stiffening and repair are used to restore damages produced by unforeseeable
events, such as those caused by accidents, eg fires, floods, impact and earth
movements.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-033#20:1>
The diagnosis and prescription of corrective works for a concrete
structure requires that its defects and unsatisfactory performance to be
detected early so that such work can be well planned and designed.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-033#21:1>
It would be better if such undesirable qualities of the structure can
be foreseen and predicted even before the construction.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-033#22:1>
Nevertheless, the knowledge gained from the pathology of failures and
from those unsatisfactory performance of concrete structures will serve as
feedback and lessons for all personnel working in the building industry.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-033#23:1>
It is ultimately expected that with such feedback and hard earned
lessons, disasters of the same natures will not be repeated in the future.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-033#24:1>
Types and causes of unsatisfactory performance of concrete structures
Basically a well planned, design and constructed structure shall be capable
to carry loads without causing excessive deformations, deflections whilst
maintaining its overall stability over a certain defined time period.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-033#25:1>
In addition, it must also be capable to maintain, throughout its
defined period of service, a track record of durability so that the
architectural appearance and functions shall not be adversely affected.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-033#26:1>
From these above requirements the undesirable performance of concrete
structures can be classified according to the respective causes, ie

<ICE-SIN:W2A-033#27:1>
( 1) Inadequate load carrying capacity,

<ICE-SIN:W2A-033#28:1>
( 2) Unreliable serviceability and

<ICE-SIN:W2A-033#29:1>
( 3) Reduction in durability.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-033#30:1>
However, the various exhibited symptoms of defects, generally need
further specific classifications.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-033#31:1>
On the building structures, it is only the exhibited symptoms of
defects which provide the clues for the diagnosis.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-033#32:1>
the various defects commonly occur in concrete structures (
reinforced and prestressed) are listed as follows:

<ICE-SIN:W2A-033#33:1>
( 1) Cracks in concrete

<ICE-SIN:W2A-033#34:1>
( 2) Spalling of concrete

<ICE-SIN:W2A-033#35:1>
( 3) Swelling and discolouration ( 4) Erosion of concrete surface

<ICE-SIN:W2A-033#36:1>
( 5) Corrosion of steel

<ICE-SIN:W2A-033#37:1>
( 6) Yielding and snapping of steel

<ICE-SIN:W2A-033#38:1>
( 7) Excessive deflection of members

<ICE-SIN:W2A-033#39:1>
( 8) Debonding between concrete and steel

<ICE-SIN:W2A-033#40:1>
Sometimes the defects shown on a structure may not be due to just one
cause.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-033#41:1>
Instead, it can be the result of a combination of causes.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-033#42:1>
On the other hand, it is also possible that a similar symptom of
defect eg cracking can be the only exhibited clue shown in one or all the
three categories of undesirable performance of several reinforced or
prestressed concrete structures.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-033#43:1>
Because of the above complexities, it makes the diagnosis and
retrospective analysis ( or the pathology) of the unsatisfactory performance
of concrete structures more difficult.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-033#44:1>
Undesirable Performance Due to Inadequate Load Carrying Capacities of
Structures Design and detailing errors including,

<ICE-SIN:W2A-033#45:1>
( 1) the under estimations of loads

<ICE-SIN:W2A-033#46:1>
( 2) the over estimation in strengths and stiffness

<ICE-SIN:W2A-033#47:1>
( 3) the use of inaccurate or inappropriate methods of structural
analyses and designs

<ICE-SIN:W2A-033#48:1>
( 4) the incorrect transmission of information to the drawings
erroneous detailings can result in inadequate load carrying capacities of the
structures.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-033#49:1>
Similar situations can also arise when,

<ICE-SIN:W2A-033#50:1>
( 6) there are abused usages of the buildings and structures (
including cases of overloading during constructions)

<ICE-SIN:W2A-033#51:1>
( 7) the structures are being subjected to unexpected loads, or

<ICE-SIN:W2A-033#52:1>
( 8) there are unexpected circumstances where a severe loss occur in
the structural strength.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-033#53:1>
An under-designed or overloaded concrete structure will continue to
carry load until collapse in approximately the following orders:

<ICE-SIN:W2A-033#54:1>
( a) redistribution of loads ( three dimensional) over its entire
structure whilst showing off distressing symptoms of inadequacies

<ICE-SIN:W2A-033#55:1>
( b) changes in structural actions eg from beam action to catenary
action or arch action ( depending on the designing details and the
developments of defects)

<ICE-SIN:W2A-033#56:1>
( c) severe yielding of steel or spalling of concrete occur leading
to the formations of plastic hinges ( d) a mechanism is developed which can
cause imminent collapse.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-033#57:1>
It is important to note that before its collapse the resistance of
the structure must gain equilibrium with the effects of the imposed loads.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-033#58:1>
If the increase in loads has exceeded the strength of the structure,
it will be a miracle that it is not going to collapse.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-033#59:1>
It is well known to engineers that the strength of concrete has been
frequently referred to that at its age of 28 days ( ie the graded strength).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-033#60:1>
Hence under normal time gain and through further hydration, the long
term strength of concrete shall be higher than such graded strength.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-033#61:1>
Whilst such concept is true for concrete cured under control
environment, such gain in strength is unreliable in the case of structural
concrete.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-033#62:1>
Under sustained dead and imposed loads, creep of concrete causes an
approximately similar ( if not more) margin of reduction to the long term
strength for structural concrete.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-033#63:1>
Evidence of such reductions can be seen in reference ( 1).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-033#64:1>
Although there had been many cases of total collapses in concrete
structures there were even more cases where the collapses involved only a
relatively large area or volume of the respective building ie a wide spread
collapse.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-033#65:1>
More often, such wide spread collapses were tickled off by local
failures from an under-designed or severely defected key member.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-033#66:1>
It is also possible that the sudden loss of one key structural member
can, in turn, cause a chain reaction or a house of cards or domino collapse
of a large portion of a structure.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-033#67:1>
Such collapse usually follows the successive losses of all load
bearing members along a certain load path as well as members adjacent to such
areas.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-033#68:1>
Under such circumstances, the collapse of one floor comes immediately
after another.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-033#69:1>
This type of failure is known as progressive collapse.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-033#70:1>
Cases of total collapses, wide spread collapse, local collapse and
progressive collapse can be seen in reference ( 2,3,4).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-033#71:1>
Unreliable Serviceability Excessive cracking, spalling and
deflections or buckling which adversely affect the appearance or efficiency
of structures are generally regarded as undesirable qualities.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-033#72:1>
In a concrete building these qualities do not confine within the
construction period and the period immediately after completion of the
construction works.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-033#73:1>
The short term ( elastic) deformations or deflections usually proceed
onto the time-dependent phase of developments.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-033#74:1>
Deformations can be caused by compressive or tensile loads or by
changes in the environment ( ie temperature and shrinkage).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-033#75:1>
If the deformations occurring in the critical sections of a member
are approximately uniform, there is not much deflection.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-033#76:1>
Instead, if the corresponding stresses built up in the section have
exceeded the compressive strength of concrete ( after load redistributions)
the concrete starts to spall.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-033#77:1>
If, however, there is great differential deformations ( in particular
of different sign notations) and occurring over the total depths of the
member sections, deflections cause unwanted cracking in concrete.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-033#78:1>
Thus in structural mechanics, deformations and spalling or
deformations, deflections and cracking are generally considered as phenomena
of consequential orders.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-033#79:1>
Concrete cracks when the stresses it carries or in transmission have
exceeded its tensile strength.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-033#80:1>
The following can be the contributory causes toward tensile cracking
in a concrete structures:

<ICE-SIN:W2A-033#81:1>
( 1) differential foundation settlement

<ICE-SIN:W2A-033#82:1>
( 2) lateral ground movement and heaving

<ICE-SIN:W2A-033#83:1>
( 3) severe changes in temperature and shrinkage

<ICE-SIN:W2A-033#84:1>
( 4) overloading and underdesign of the structure

<ICE-SIN:W2A-033#85:1>
( 5) errors in construction and poor workmanship ( while casting
concrete)

<ICE-SIN:W2A-033#86:1>
( 6) Erroneous designing-details

<ICE-SIN:W2A-033#87:1>
( 7) abused usage or change in use of the building

<ICE-SIN:W2A-033#88:1>
( 8) unexpected loading

<ICE-SIN:W2A-033#89:1>
( 9) insufficient provision or omission of control joints

<ICE-SIN:W2A-033#90:1>
( 10) aging and deterioration in concrete causing reduction in its
strength.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-033#91:1>
Deformations resulting in the spalling of concrete ( particularly
those occurring) in columns or load bearing walls shall be investigated with
utmost care.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-033#92:1>
Such symptoms of defects are similar to those undesirable structural
performance due to severe overloading conditions.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-033#93:1>
Deflections and cracks are generally unavoidable in concrete
structures.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-033#94:1>
However, these defects normally occur in one or more critical section
in the structure or structural members.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-033#95:1>
Although as a whole, cracking normally does not result in structural
failures, undoubtedly, it can cause a definite loss of performance.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-033#96:1>
A redistribution of the loading can occur in a structure due to the
reduction in stiffness in the partially cracked members.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-033#97:1>
Severe redistribution of loads can in turn cause overloading together
with reductions in the factors of safety in basically underloaded members.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-033#98:1>
Cracking also accelerates deterioration from moisture penetration
thereby rendering a building structure unserviceable for its original purpose
and consequently reducing its service life.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-033#99:1>
Excessive deflections or bucklings are usually the main concern on
the instability of a building structure.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-033#100:1>
Local instability can result in global instability and failure
can-occur.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-033#101:1>
Examples of such failure ( or close to failure) can be seen in
references 2 and 3.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-033#102:1>
<h> Reduction in Durability </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-033#103:1>
There are many circumstances whereby a concrete structure gradually
loses its required strength, impermeability and other similar types of
important properties.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-033#104:1>
These result in reductions of the structures' service lives.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-033#105:1>
The main reasons can be,

<ICE-SIN:W2A-033#106:1>
( 1) inappropriate concrete mixes used in the construction

<ICE-SIN:W2A-033#107:1>
( 2) poor workmanship

<ICE-SIN:W2A-033#108:1>
( 3) concrete cast from contaminated constituent materials (
including contaminated water and inappropriate types of admixtures)
<&dollar;> ( 4) weathering and aging

<ICE-SIN:W2A-033#109:1>
 ( 5) carbonations and corrosions

<ICE-SIN:W2A-033#110:1>
 ( 6) aggressions by chemical or/and biological agents

<ICE-SIN:W2A-033#111:1>
 ( 7) abrasion and surface erosion

<ICE-SIN:W2A-033#112:1>
 ( 8) lack of considerations in drainage, wearing surface and
structural-cladding interaction etc.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-033#113:1>
 The symptoms of defects exhibited on the concrete structures are
viz., swelling, discolourations, cracking, spalling in the concrete, rusts in
the steel bars and disintegration between concrete and steel.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-033#114:1>
 Durability problem does not surface immediately after the
completions of the construction works.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-033#115:1>
 It appears gradually over a certain time period.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-033#116:1>
 Its rate of development depends primarily on:

<ICE-SIN:W2A-033#117:1>
 ( 1) the original strength, porosity and related properties

<ICE-SIN:W2A-033#118:1>
 ( 2) the chance of concrete exposes to certain environmental
influence ( such as water or pollutants) or comes in contact with some
chemical or biological agents or being subjected to natural or physical wear
and tear actions.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-033#119:1>
 Inadequate provisions of drainage gradients, wearing surfaces or
the inappropriate choices on architectural and M and E cladding, fitting,
fixing materials ( with incompatible properties) only accelerate the early
deterioration and decaying processes.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-033#120:1>
 In a majority of cases chemical or biological aggressions commence
from the surfaces of the concrete structures.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-033#121:1>
 These can be identified early by experienced investigators or
maintenance personnel.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-033#122:1>
 Samples of defected concrete in the damaged areas can be collected
and forwarded for tests in order to gain confirmations of such chemical
or/and biological attacks.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-033#123:1>
 The worst cases consist of concrete cast with contaminated
aggregates or chemical salts ( in particular, alkali reactive aggregates).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-033#124:1>
 The latent defects may not show off until the disintegrations in
concrete have reached the surfaces of the structures.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-033#125:1>
 By then, large areas of the concrete structures could have already
been affected.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-033#126:1>
 Since the disintegration of concrete occurs within the concrete
and much depending on the chances in which the chemical salts turn into
solutions and in turn react with the concrete, such damages formed at early
stages may not be easily detected. <X>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-033#X127:1>
 This type of undesirable behaviour of concrete is, to a large
extent, analogous to the development of cancer in human being.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-033#X128:1>
 Thus it is popularity known as concrete cancer.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-033#X129:1>
 If concrete cancer is discovered in a rather late stage the cost
efficiency of repair and replacement of large area and volume of concrete may
made in uneconomical compare to demolishing the structure and rebuild.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-033#X130:1>
 <h> Remedial Actions </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-033#X131:1>
 Prevention is always better than cure.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-033#X132:1>
 The effective means of prevention is to be able to foresee or
predict the occurrence of such undesirable performance of the structure.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-033#X133:1>
 Design errors and detailing errors may be able to be eliminated
or minimized by the accredited checker's scheme implement by the Building
Control Division since 1st of May 1989.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-033#X134:1>
 As to the maintenance of concrete buildings for the long term
serviceability and durability it must emphasize herewith that preventive
maintenance cannot wait to commence work until cases of unsatisfactory
performance of a structure occur.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-033#X135:1>
 Rather, such a scheme shall be incorporated at a stage as early
as possible, preferable at the planning and design stages of the project.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-033#X136:1>
 The proper choices of materials together with the implementation
of an efficient system of quality control and assurance throughout the
construction period may help to reduce future maintenance work to a minimum.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-033#X137:1>
 However, no material is inert to physical wear and tear whilst
immune to deterioration and chemical attacks.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-033#X138:1>
 Periodical inspections and repairs on defected parts of
structures are still required for its constant restoration.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-033#X139:1>
 These will ensure the continuous serviceability and durability of
such structure throughout its designed life span.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-033#X140:1>
 A maintenance scheme emphasizing such an Integrated approach for
the maintenance of concrete structure can be seen in ( 5).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-033#X141:1>
 <h> Conclusions </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-033#X142:1>
 Undesirable performance of concrete structures can occur if the
structures have processed inadequate load carrying capacities, unreliable
serviceability and reduction in durabilities.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-033#X143:1>
 Design and detailing errors, erroneous constructions, abused
usages or change in usages, unexpected loading conditions, aging and
weathering decays of the materials, chemical and biological aggressions, the
lack of considerations of the compatibilities of combining architectural, M
and E and structural materials as well as the act of nature can each or all
contribute one way or the other towards such unwelcome results. </X> </I>
