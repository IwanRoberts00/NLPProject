<ICE-SIN:S1B-059#X1:1> 18 March 1992 <&>  Wednesday </&> Live from Parliament Ministry of Health
</X>

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-059#2:1:A>
Number six Mr Das

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-059#3:1:B>
Mr Chairman Sir I beg to move that the sum to be allocated for
Head P to be reduced by ten dollars in respect of Code PE one five zero zero
of the main estimates

<ICE-SIN:S1B-059#4:1:B>
Mr Chairman Sir I agree with the government's philosophy there is
need for preventive measures to help one remain healthy and what better way
to do this than to start at the school level

<ICE-SIN:S1B-059#5:1:B>
Sir I'd like to point out to this House that there are far few
doctors uh looking after the school health service

<ICE-SIN:S1B-059#6:1:B>
I've been informed Sir that there are four doctors at the clinics
and eleven doctors in the field taking care of four hundred and fifty
thousand pupils in our three hundred and fifty primary secondary uh
pre-university and junior colleges

<ICE-SIN:S1B-059#7:1:B>
These doctors are ably assisted by thirty staff nurses and eighteen
assistant nurses

<ICE-SIN:S1B-059#8:1:B>
Sir only primary one and secondary four students are screened by
doctors

<ICE-SIN:S1B-059#9:1:B>
The screening at primary six is done by nurses

<ICE-SIN:S1B-059#10:1:B>
Is this because of shortage of doctors

<ICE-SIN:S1B-059#11:1:B>
And what about the quality of screening for these children at
primary six

<ICE-SIN:S1B-059#12:1:B>
Is the Ministry satisfied with this level of screening

<ICE-SIN:S1B-059#13:1:B>
Are other programs being sacrificed because of lack of doctors

<ICE-SIN:S1B-059#14:1:B>
Sir I would urge the minister to use his good offices to persuade
the Finance minister not to apply the zero growth in the case of school
health services

<ICE-SIN:S1B-059#15:1:B>
Sir I beg to move

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-059#16:1:A>
Question is that the sum to be allocated for Head P be reduced
by ten dollars in respect of Code PE fifteen hundred of the main estimates

<ICE-SIN:S1B-059#17:1:A>
Dr Wong

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-059#18:1:C>
Mr Chairman uh I'm glad doc uhm Mr Chandra Das supports the
Ministry's phil philosophy that prevention is better than cure and he also
supports the objectives of our school health service

<ICE-SIN:S1B-059#19:1:C>
Uhm with regard to the number of doctors in the school health
service actually it has increased from uh the number uh from ten in nineteen
eighty eight uh to fourteen uh this year and that is in spite of our zero uh
growth uh policy

<ICE-SIN:S1B-059#20:1:C>
Uh on the number of nurses in the school health service uh I think
he's got the uh figure wrong

<ICE-SIN:S1B-059#21:1:C>
In fact uh we have now one hundred and four nurses in the whole
school health service

<ICE-SIN:S1B-059#22:1:C>
Uh the entire staff complement is hundred and eighty six so so uh
it is by no means uh small uh staff complement

<ICE-SIN:S1B-059#23:1:C>
and our expenditure has increased from five point four million in
nineteen eighty eight to seven point three million

<ICE-SIN:S1B-059#24:1:C>
Now whether medical screening uh should be done by doctors all the
time uh it is uh a matter of uh you know expert opinion also as a matter of
the end result the outcome

<ICE-SIN:S1B-059#25:1:C>
It is true that uh medical screening carried out uh in uh primary
one and uh secondary four are done by doctors while those uh at primary six
are done by nurses

<ICE-SIN:S1B-059#26:1:C>
But our nurses are trained you see

<ICE-SIN:S1B-059#27:1:C>
So and and besides uh our children also get uh uh to have visual
screening every year

<ICE-SIN:S1B-059#28:1:C>
They also get spinal screening you know intermittently so it is not
just the medical screening at primary one primary six and secondary four

<ICE-SIN:S1B-059#29:1:C>
Now uh actually our children are very healthy and they are amongst
the healthiest age group in our population

<ICE-SIN:S1B-059#30:1:C>
Uh if by the time they enter primary school uh if they get very uh
any severe medical condition they would have been picked up by our uh medical
services before they enter school

<ICE-SIN:S1B-059#31:1:C>
And even during the school years those requiring specialist
attention would have been sent to specialist outpatient clinic in the
Institute of Health

<ICE-SIN:S1B-059#32:1:C>
Uh and uh actually attendance uh attendance figures in our
polyclinic show that the proportion of uh school children seeking medical
treatment at polyclinics uh is much lower than the other age groups

<ICE-SIN:S1B-059#33:1:C>
So all indications are that the present kind of medical screening
services we give at uh at in in our schools uh is adequate

<ICE-SIN:S1B-059#34:1:C>
It is better to utilise uh our scarce resources in other programs
but of course I welcome uh his support uh uh uh you know for our program to
be receiving more funds uh from the Ministry of Finance

<ICE-SIN:S1B-059#35:1:C>
But uh please rest assured uh uh in the opinion of medical uh
experts I think our school health is doing a good job

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-059#36:1:A>
Mr Chairman Sir since the Minister of State welcomes my
suggestion I think the Ministry should work harder to get more staff

<ICE-SIN:S1B-059#37:1:A>
On that note Sir I beg leave to withdraw

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-059#38:1:A>
Member given leave to withdraw

<$D> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-059#39:1:D>
Ay Ay

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-059#40:1:A>
Yes withdrawn Amendment number seven

<ICE-SIN:S1B-059#41:1:A>
Dr Michael Lim

<$E> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-059#42:1:E>
Sir I beg to move that the sum to be allocated for Head P be
reduced by ten dollars in respect of Code PE five one O O of the development
estimates

<ICE-SIN:S1B-059#43:1:E>
Primary health care is currently considered a poor cousin of
hospital services but I believe that it is as important if not more important
as secondary and tertiary health care

<ICE-SIN:S1B-059#44:1:E>
A good primary health care service will result in early detection
of diseases and prevention of complications

<ICE-SIN:S1B-059#45:1:E>
In developing new polyclinics we must not only continue to make it
affordable but we must strive to improve the level of primary health care

<ICE-SIN:S1B-059#46:1:E>
I have uh certain proposals which I would like the minister to
consider

<ICE-SIN:S1B-059#47:1:E>
One install X-ray facilities in all new polyclinics

<ICE-SIN:S1B-059#48:1:E>
The Ministry should consider installing X-ray facilities not only
to improve the diagnostic capabilities but also by allowing general
practitioners to use the X-ray facilities the level of primary health care in
that area will be enhanced

<ICE-SIN:S1B-059#49:1:E>
Furthermore with a higher <unclear> word </unclear> it will result
in more cost-effective use usage of the facilities

<ICE-SIN:S1B-059#50:1:E>
Number two set up rehabilitation facilities at all polyclinics

<ICE-SIN:S1B-059#51:1:E>
This will allow patients with stroke orthopaedic injuries and other
physical disabilities to have easy access to such facilities

<ICE-SIN:S1B-059#52:1:E>
Otherwise the physical disabilities alone will discourage them from
travelling to the hospitals for rehabilitation

<ICE-SIN:S1B-059#53:1:E>
Early rehabilitation will allow the patient to integrate back into
society and will relieve the social burden of family members

<ICE-SIN:S1B-059#54:1:E>
Thirdly medication

<ICE-SIN:S1B-059#55:1:E>
Patients seen at hospitals are discharged at polyclinics for
follow-up when they are stable

<ICE-SIN:S1B-059#56:1:E>
However in certain instances these drugs are not available at the
polyclinics and there's no alternative drug within the same class of action
available in the polyclinic

<ICE-SIN:S1B-059#57:1:E>
As a result CFC card holders do not want to be discharged from
specialist clinics as they are unable to get the medication required

<ICE-SIN:S1B-059#58:1:E>
I propose that the Ministry allow polyclinic doctors to make an
indent for non-standard drugs for CFC card holders who require medication
currently not available in the polyclinic pharmacy

<ICE-SIN:S1B-059#59:1:E>
These requests should only be allowed if the patients are sent to
the polyclinics from specialist in government and restructured hospitals

<ICE-SIN:S1B-059#60:1:E>
This will make it unnecessary for such patients to be seen at the
specialist clinic and hospitals just for the sake of being able to obtain the
required medication

<ICE-SIN:S1B-059#61:1:E>
Lastly I quality of medical care

<ICE-SIN:S1B-059#62:1:E>
At this point I would actually like to agree with Dr Tan Cheng Bock
who said that there were certain problems about primary health care system

<ICE-SIN:S1B-059#63:1:E>
I think one of the weaknesses and a very important weakness of our
current system in the polyclinics is a lack of continuity of medical care

<ICE-SIN:S1B-059#64:1:E>
Patients with chronic medical conditions like diabetes are often
attended to by different doctors at different visits

<ICE-SIN:S1B-059#65:1:E>
At each visit the harassed doctor scours the medical notes and
makes a hurried assessment as he has a large pool of patients waiting in line
to see him

<ICE-SIN:S1B-059#66:1:E>
Fighting against the problems of unfamiliarity limited time and a
large patient turnover he can only do his humanly best and will not be able
to give optimal care

<ICE-SIN:S1B-059#67:1:E>
For the diabetic patient he can only try to adjust the medication
to control the blood sugar level

<ICE-SIN:S1B-059#68:1:E>
There is no time to look for eye complications kidney complications
vascular complications and there is definitely no time to give proper
counselling

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-059#69:1:A>
Dr Lim

<$E> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-059#70:1:E>
How does the Ministry

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-059#71:1:A>
Dr Lim

<$E> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-059#72:1:E>
intend to improve the situation

<ICE-SIN:S1B-059#73:1:E>
I would like the minister's views on these points

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-059#74:1:A>
Question is that the sum to be allocated for Head P be reduced
by ten dollars in respect of Code P fifty one hundred of the development
estimates

<ICE-SIN:S1B-059#75:1:A>
Dr Wong

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-059#76:1:C>
Mr Chairman all our large polyclinics have laboratory on site

<ICE-SIN:S1B-059#77:1:C>
These are these laboratories are also opened to GPs to the general
practitioners

<ICE-SIN:S1B-059#78:1:C>
However the general practitioners' utilization of our polyclinic
laboratories has been poor comprising less than two percent of the laboratory
workload

<ICE-SIN:S1B-059#79:1:C>
Now this is because some private labs are providing a special
service to the GPs collecting specimens from them at no additional charge

<ICE-SIN:S1B-059#80:1:C>
and so GPs find it not necessary to send the patients to the
polyclinic uh lab

<ICE-SIN:S1B-059#81:1:C>
Now currently only one polyclinic at Tampines has an X-ray service
which is also opened to GPs but again its utilization by GPs is very low
comprising less than five percent of the X-rays uh taken

<ICE-SIN:S1B-059#82:1:C>
Now uh patients who who are discharged from government uh or
restructured hospitals uh the CSC card holders or other people can obtain
nonstandard drugs at the polyclinics if they are patients of the polyclinics

<ICE-SIN:S1B-059#83:1:C>
So the idea is that they should be followed up on their polyclinic

<ICE-SIN:S1B-059#84:1:C>
and if the use of non-standard drugs is warranted then uh an
application would be made for the drug to be supplied to polyclinics

<ICE-SIN:S1B-059#85:1:C>
and at uh uh at the usual cost of one dollar per item up to a
maximum of four uh per uh uh per

<ICE-SIN:S1B-059#86:1:C>
Uh now uh the lack of continuous care I think uh we have covered
this subject quite well when I responded to Dr Tan Cheng Bock's uh uh
proposal about uh community health care system

<ICE-SIN:S1B-059#87:1:C>
Thank you

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-059#88:1:A>
Dr Lim

<$E> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-059#89:1:E>
Sir just one last point

<ICE-SIN:S1B-059#90:1:E>
The reason why your lab facilities are not well utilized is not
just the convenience but the cost as well

<ICE-SIN:S1B-059#91:1:E>
In fact it is more costly to do a lab test in the polyclinic than
at a private uh lab

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-059#92:1:C>
Is that so I would look into it

<$E> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-059#93:1:E>
Sir uh I thank the Minister for her reply and I beg leave to
withdraw my uh amendment

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-059#94:1:A>
Is member given leave to withdraw his amendment

<$D> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-059#95:1:D>
Ay

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-059#96:1:A>
Amendment is withdrawn

<$F> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-059#97:1:F>
Sir Doc Dr Tan has given us a very long discourse yesterday on
primary health care

<ICE-SIN:S1B-059#98:1:F>
I'd urge him to please pay more attention to what we are doing so
that he he can better understand the whole philosophy because what

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-059#99:1:A>
Order

<$F> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-059#100:1:F>
let me let me finish

<ICE-SIN:S1B-059#101:1:F>
Sit down please

<$G> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-059#102:1:G>
Mr Speaker Sir

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-059#103:1:A>
Minister is not giving way

<$F> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-059#104:1:F>
Sir he's taken a lot a lot of time yesterday more time than
he should have

<$G> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-059#105:1:G>
No I think

<$F> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-059#106:1:F>
But so

<ICE-SIN:S1B-059#107:1:F>
Sit down first come on

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-059#108:1:A>
Order order

<ICE-SIN:S1B-059#109:1:A>
Dr Tan resume your seat

<$G> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-059#110:1:G>
He has spent a lot of time making mini ministerial statements

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-059#111:1:A>
Doc Dr Tan resume your seat please

<$F> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-059#112:1:F>
Because all that he described is preci are precisely things
that we are already doing just that he's managed to call them under different
name

<ICE-SIN:S1B-059#113:1:F>
He's quoted the Finnish model saying that we are under-spending
without realizing from the data that actually we're spending more than what
Finland is spending on primary health care

<ICE-SIN:S1B-059#114:1:F>
Sir Mr Loh was correct

<ICE-SIN:S1B-059#115:1:F>
Primary health care I think we are very well-established but
nonetheless I appreciate his concerns

<ICE-SIN:S1B-059#116:1:F>
and I can assure him that in our future studies and planning for
the primary health care I will definitely like to call on him to volunteer
his time in helping us to further improve primary health care

<ICE-SIN:S1B-059#117:1:F>
Sir in terms of hospital services I can assure him that we are we
also share his concerns in terms of ensuring that we do not over-provide
medical services in hospital area

<ICE-SIN:S1B-059#118:1:F>
and that's why we've been freezing the number of beds for many
many years <X>

<ICE-SIN:S1B-059#X119:1:F>
In fact we've had a freeze for the last seven years on hospital
beds and we will continue to gauge very carefully the demand and to ensure
that only those who require hospitalization are being hospitalized and more
importantly to ensure that only those who require those investigations are
being provided those investigations Otherwise he's right If everybody comes
in with for all those tests unnecessarily we must invest more in e in
equipment and that will be very very adverse in terms of doing Sir in terms
of CFS I understand looking at the cards that some other MPs are also maybe
talking about that so I'll reply to that later </X> </I>
