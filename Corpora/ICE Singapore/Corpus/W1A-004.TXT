Q: Describe and evaluate the role(s) that Japan has played in the
postwar international political economy.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-004#2:1>
A: Japan's international role is commanding increasing attention among
scholars and diplomats.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-004#3:1>
That Japan has to play a more comprehensive role is widely
acknowledged in the international community and increasingly in Japan as
well.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-004#4:1>
But unlike the U.S., a country which uses military forces and economic
power as tools to achieve her goals, Japan is only confined to the latter
tool.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-004#5:1>
Limitations imposed by its constitutions, a deep aversion in its body
politics to militarism, and a sensitivity to the concerns expressed by the
Asians have prevented Japan from developing an international military role.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-004#6:1>
There are leaders like Mr Lee Kuan Yew who believed that in due course
Japan will develop a military capability commensurate with its economic power
and that it can play a positive security role in South-East Asian.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-004#7:1>
By and large, however, the perception is that Japan can best
contribute the region's peace and security by assisting in the economic
development of its countries.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-004#8:1>
And that is exactly how Japan uses her economic might to play a role
in the postwar international political economy.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-004#9:1>
The reactive approach to international developments, which has been
the nature of Japanese foreign policy is no longer adequate.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-004#10:1>
It is also not befitting a country that has the potential to shape
the course of international developments.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-004#11:1>
The Japanese are also proud of their hard-earned success and there is
a growing desire to gain international recognition and respect which they
consider should accompany such success.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-004#12:1>
Thus, ensuring a smooth transition from the role of international
beneficiary to that of international benefactor is a major challenge to Japan
and to the international community.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-004#13:1>
Japan's economy has grown by leaps and bounds.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-004#14:1>
Her economic miracle has transformed it into a powerful economic
juggernaut in this new Asia-Pacific era.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-004#15:1>
Concurrent with this impressive economic growth, Japan's economic
interests have become global in nature.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-004#16:1>
Her direct investment has spread throughout the world.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-004#17:1>
As Japan is expected to continued to be a capital surplus country for
the foreseeable future, its global direct foreign investment is also likely
to continue, with the pattern adjustment to the needs of the time.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-004#18:1>
For example, the flow of the foreign investment since 1984 has been
guided by the need to secure markets previously acquired through exports and
to avoid protectionism, in contrast to the earlier emphasis on investment in
developing countries to exploit cheap labour and to support export promotion.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-004#19:1>
In addition to the economic goal, the economic tools are also used to
achieve international respect.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-004#20:1>
In 1984 the foreign minister, Shintaro Abe, advanced a proposal which
outlined a role for Japan in a future Cambodia settlement.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-004#21:1>
Japan would underwrite the peace keeping expenses in Cambodia,
provide personnel and facilities to help in the supervision of an election to
be held under international supervision, and provide economic assistance to
the Indochina countries following a settlement.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-004#22:1>
Now that the Cambodia conflict actually appears to be heading towards
some kind of settlement, Japan may be better placed to regain an initiative
and play a more active role in the promotion of peace and stability in the
region.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-004#23:1>
The relatively high profile adopted by Japan in the frenzy of
diplomatic authority over a settlement in Cambodia suggest that this may
indeed be happening.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-004#24:1>
As Japan's interest lies in a stable and open international political
and economic order, she has to make a significant contribution to the
preservation and enhancement of stability and order in the international
system if only to safeguard its medium- and long-term property and security.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-004#25:1>
The relocation of Japanese industries in other countries and
internationalization of the yen will further globalize Japan's economy, thus
increasing its stake in a stable and predictable international system.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-004#26:1>
These policies bear fruits when there is a marked changed in the
attitude of the world towards Japan.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-004#27:1>
The ASEAN for example, previously viewed Japan as an economic animal,
but today the economic success of Japan is viewed with admiration and as
emulation.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-004#28:1>
The Malaysia's 'look east' policy, Singapore's 'learn from Japan
policy' and the many plans formulated in nearly all the ASEAN capitals to
take advantage of Japan's 'expansionary' phase reflect these changes.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-004#29:1>
However the strong economic growth of Japan have caused the
dislocation of many industries in other countries.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-004#30:1>
For example, between the 70'sand 80's, Japanese automobiles like
Honda, Toyota and Nissan captured the market share of every other American
and German models.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-004#31:1>
And the Japanese Casio and Seiko digital watches have taken a
significant market share from the traditional Swiss Watch-makers.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-004#32:1>
The Japanese brands of consumer electronics and appliances have also
gained increasing popularity worldwide.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-004#33:1>
This type of dislocation caused much unemployment in the affected
countries which could not compete as well as the Japanese.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-004#34:1>
Japan was thus instrumental in creating disruption and instability in
these economies.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-004#35:1>
Although Japan has acted to these many grievances, the general view
in the world is that Japan responses are frequently 'too late and too
little'.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-004#36:1>
In conclusion, Japan's tremendous growth in her economy is achieved
by the losses of other countries.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-004#37:1>
Thus, many countries are trying to emulate her economic success, and
Japan is using her economic might to protect herself.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-004#38:1>
The strongest and most acceptable assets for Japan continue to be her
economic and technological resources.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-004#39:1>
In the world of today the political dimension of economic relations
is assuming centre-stage.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-004#40:1>
Japan with its huge surplus in capital, a large market and advanced
technological capabilities is uniquely placed to play a major role in
promoting a stable international system and to assist in the economic
development of Third World countries.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-004#41:1>
These may be the most significant and invaluable international
political roles for Japan in the decade to come. </I>

<ICE-SIN:W1A-004#42:2>
Discuss Gulliver's Travels as a narrative of journey and
disillusionment.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-004#43:2>
Gulliver's Travels, comprising four voyages, employs the conventions
of travel literature.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-004#44:2>
The title it was first published as - Travels Into Several Remote
Nations of the World - points to a narrative that involves a journey of some
sort.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-004#45:2>
Gulliver himself declares that he had indeed recounted " a faithful
History of [ his] Travels for sixteen years".

<ICE-SIN:W1A-004#46:2>
This statement is supported by a narrative that is peppered with
meticulous details of each voyage - including navigational jargon like
longitudes and latitudes as well as extensive nautical descriptions of
prevailing wind conditions.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-004#47:2>
But of course, Gulliver's Travels is more than a few samples of a
traveller's tales randomly strung together.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-004#48:2>
The four voyages - though they can be read as discrete narratives -
are carefully plotted as part of a larger journey.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-004#49:2>
Swift also fuses the well-known conventions of utopian fiction,
imaginary voyage and autobiography into his work.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-004#50:2>
Swift uses a combination of these conventions, often subverting them,
to facilitate his satiric attack and to convey the great sense of
disillusionment found in the tales.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-004#51:2>
In the first place the narrative of journey in Gulliver's Travels
does not read like a pure travelogue where the reader actually becomes the
traveller.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-004#52:2>
Nowhere is the reader expected to be a mere tourist taking in the
sights and sounds of an exotic land.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-004#53:2>
Rather, it is obvious that we, as informed readers, are to evaluate
this fantastical journey as well as to appreciate the parallels between the
visited lands and the world we know.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-004#54:2>
We could also read Gulliver's journey on a metaphorical level as a
quest or search for meaning.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-004#55:2>
The going out and returning found in the narrative imply a centre
that is not only geographical but also personal.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-004#56:2>
This is in line with the autobiographical nature of the Gulliver's
Tales as seen by the first person narrative and the reader's distinct sense
of this narrator's presence.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-004#57:2>
By using an autobiographical mode and by setting up Gulliver as a
honest and compassionate character we are more likely to identify with the
narrator and take what he reports as reliable.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-004#58:2>
Gulliver's observation become all the more necessary when the
situations that are recounted are often outside our own human experience.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-004#59:2>
It is through the voice of this apparently reliable traveller that
Swift's disillusionment with society is articulated.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-004#60:2>
Sometimes Guiliver does this by comparing what is good and desirable
in the " Remote Nations" with what is imperfect and corrupt in his own
civilisation.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-004#61:2>
Indeed there are institutions and value systems in these other
societies that warrant emulation.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-004#62:2>
The disillusionment then is effected by our awareness of what is
lacking in Swift's society.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-004#63:2>
For example the government in Brobdingnag, led by the wise and
prudent king, is one that does not separate morality from its policies.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-004#64:2>
Here Swift puts his own English government on trial, suggesting that
it is a non-moral entity interested only in its own survival and well-being.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-004#65:2>
The Brobdingnagian kingdom is also one with a practical ethos: unlike
England, a productive farmer here is valued more than the " whole Race of
Politicians put together".

<ICE-SIN:W1A-004#66:2>
Later, when the horrified king rejects Gulliver's offer of gunpowder,
Swift is making a criticism on Man's obsession with firearms and the ability
to destroy each other.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-004#67:2>
However, Swift never allows us to see the kingdom of Brobdingnag or
any other kingdom as an utopian model.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-004#68:2>
We are constantly reminded that the kingdoms of the first three
voyages still belong to the domain of the human - and tainted as we are by
our imperfect nature, there is no remote possibility that these can be seen
as ideals ( Thus our disillusionment becomes double fold).

<ICE-SIN:W1A-004#69:2>
The Lilliputians, for all their puny stature and apparently harmless
antics turn out to be a politically manipulative people incapable of
gratitude.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-004#70:2>
They are more concerned with annexing Blefuscu than showing
appreciation to Gulliver for his " extraordinary stratagem" that prevents an
invasion; they are more concerned with propriety rather than with the fact
that the palace fire had been extinguished.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-004#71:2>
The government itself seems to be more preoccupied with internal
conflicts ( for example, between the Trameckan and Slamecksan, or between the
Big-Endians and Small-Endians) than with improving the lives of the people.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-004#72:2>
In fact, Lilliput does not seem to enjoy much political stability.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-004#73:2>
Reldresal, the Principal Secretary laments that they " labour under
two mighty Evils; a violent faction at home and the Danger of Invasion by a
most potent Enemy from abroad" and even Gulliver notes that what was good in
their nation has fallen of late into " scandalous Corruptions".

<ICE-SIN:W1A-004#74:2>
Even in Brobdingnag, which Gulliver considers to be " the least
corrupted" there are such morally repulsive characters as Gulliver's first
master.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-004#75:2>
Driven by material gains he exploits Gulliver to the state of " a
near skeleton".

<ICE-SIN:W1A-004#76:2>
And even though Gulliver acknowledges the Brobdingnagian king as an
excellent ruler, he is nonetheless perceived as lacking in the art of
government and the learning of his people is seen as " very defective".

<ICE-SIN:W1A-004#77:2>
The loss of this utopian possibility and our subsequent
disenchantment is compounded when we are forced to confront our human nature.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-004#78:2>
Throughout Gulliver's Travels, we are constantly reminded of the
imperfections and vices of Man, whether it is the petty meanness of the
Lilliputians, the physical grotesqueness of the Brobdinnagians or the obtuse
self-delusion of the projectors in Lagado.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-004#79:2>
In a sense, the emergence of the savage Yahoos represents the
culmination of a denaturing process that has been taking place through the
voyages.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-004#80:2>
However episodic and disjointed Gulliver's Travels may seem, one can
see the Yahoo - stripped of the vestige of reason that he only abuses - as an
amalgam of all the undesirable human traits encountered in the earlier
voyages.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-004#81:2>
By the time we reach the final voyage, the previously visited ( and
essentially human) kingdoms have been rejected as models for emulation.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-004#82:2>
What is being put forth as an alternative now is the coldly rational
- and non-human - world of the Houyhnhnms.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-004#83:2>
If we were indeed to see Gulliver's Travels as a journey of
self-discovery and a search for self-knowledge, then this final voyage as
well as what utopia it proposes, must hold even greater significance.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-004#84:2>
How does Gulliver come to terms with his being?

<ICE-SIN:W1A-004#85:2>
The answer is that he chooses to " purge" himself of all the "
corruptions of [ his] Yahoo nature". <X>

<ICE-SIN:W1A-004#X86:2>
Yet despite his claims that the Houyhnhnms are the definitive model
for the " imitation of Mankind," we know that we cannot take Gulliver's final
exhortations as the Gospel truth.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-004#X87:2>
Far from it.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-004#X88:2>
Indeed we are highly suspicious that Gulliver - by now a virulent
misanthrope who even rejects his wife - has any opinion that is trustworthy
or of any " Publick Good".

<ICE-SIN:W1A-004#X89:2>
Our disillusionment then, extends beyond a dissatisfaction with
society; it includes the loss of our hitherto reliable narrator.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-004#X90:2>
As it already stands, Voyage IV has represented Man as " cunning,
malicious, treacherous and revengeful" Yahoos, as " the most unteachable of
all animals" as well as avaricious creatures with insatiable appetites for "
shining stones" that have no practical value.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-004#X91:2>
While this behaviour is deplorable, yet we cannot condone how
Gulliver embraces his non-human master's culture.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-004#X92:2>
He distances himself from his own species and his desire to mimic
the Houyhnhnms only results in absurdity: his voice becomes like the "
Neighing of a Horse" and he even takes pride when told that his gait is like
a horse's gallop!

<ICE-SIN:W1A-004#X93:2>
By allowing Gulliver to degenerate into a proud man who aligns
himself with the non-human Houyhnhnms, Swift is making a harsh satiric attack
on human nature.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-004#X94:2>
The narrator who tried to convey a moral message for the public good
has become blinkered and tainted with the vices he sought to expunge.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-004#X95:2>
In this process, Swift subverts the journey at a metaphorical level
- the search for self-knowledge is doomed to certain failure.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-004#X96:2>
In the end, the message in Gulliver's Travels seems to be a fairly
pessimistic one - Swift's work is not only a scathing indictment of English
society, it paints an ugly picture of humanity and suggests that remedy is
impossible.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-004#X97:2>
Thus the Lilliputian's moral stature will remain small and the
Brobdingnagian's defects magnified.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-004#X98:2>
Even human immortality embodied in the Struldbruggs, is no more than
a prolonged period of man's follies and vices.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-004#X99:2>
On the other hand, the Houhnhnm model is at best suitable for its
own species - a perfect example of animal rationale.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-004#X100:2>
At worst it is a world where every activity is reduced to its
instrumental value; where even the sexual act is no more than " one of the
necessary acts of a reasonable being".

<ICE-SIN:W1A-004#X101:2>
The Houyhnhnm may be the embodiment of Truth and Reason but
ultimately manifests itself in a form unacceptable to the reader.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-004#X102:2>
Gulliver's Travels undoubtedly is a narrative about journey - it is
a physical journey that brings us to strange, exotic lands; it is also a
journey of imagination that creates disillusionment and compels us to take a
long hard look at our human selves. </X> </I>
