<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#17:1:B>
I did my brother and and this friend talking about something
they like their hobby CDs

<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#18:1:B>

<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#19:1:A>
Over the phone nuh

<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#21:1:B>
They were yakking in the room so I just <unclear> word </unclear>
left their recorder there

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#22:1:A>
Really

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#23:1:B>
It was so wonderful

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#24:1:A>
Oh

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#25:1:B>
All the scarly all came out

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#26:1:A>
Ya I know

<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#27:1:A>
For for ours worse because we I taped the fam

<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#28:1:A>
You see if it's just me and my parents then it's it's okay you see

<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#29:1:A>
But then my godma came into the picture and then her friend came
into the picture and then everybody started talking

<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#30:1:A>
So there was a mixture Teochew you know English <unclear> word
</unclear> <unclear> word </unclear>

<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#31:1:A>
It's quite <unclear> word </unclear>

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#32:1:B>
You see when my relatives get together you hear Cantonese Baba
English

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#33:1:A>
Ya

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#34:1:B>
Then I speak to my Cantonese relatives in Baba

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#35:1:A>
Ya boy that yesterday

<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#36:1:A>
I saw the the docu you know

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#37:1:B>
Which one

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#38:1:A>
Uhm Archie's mental or illness in

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#39:1:B>
<unclear> word </unclear> what do you think

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#40:1:A>
It's very bad

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#41:1:B>
Why

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#42:1:A>
I didn't even have time to think about the structure

<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#43:1:A>
I didn't even have time to think about the <unclear> word
</unclear> or <unclear> word </unclear>

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#44:1:B>
The the picture's very rushed very emotional right

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#45:1:A>
No I I just that ethical problem put me off because she did

<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#46:1:A>
I I I don't know whether <unclear> word </unclear> told you

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#47:1:B>
I heard she I heard she <unclear> word </unclear> the faces or
blotched out the faces but then on

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#48:1:A>
On other shots I saw them

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#49:1:B>
Then what's the point

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#50:1:A>
See she had this media case study okay

<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#51:1:A>
This uh mentally ill man okay

<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#52:1:A>
He he uh okay she when she introduced him that time you could see
that she didn't really want to show his face you see

<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#53:1:A>
That's fine

<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#54:1:A>
And then she showed one part where she's introducing the mother you
see

<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#55:1:A>
So you think there is nothing wrong you know because uhm she didn't
really set out to hide their faces you see

<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#56:1:A>
So there's this shot of the mother walking you see walking to uh
the the dining table okay to to get medicine for the son

<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#57:1:A>
And she walked towards the dining table

<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#58:1:A>
You can see obviously that that you know the lights all coming from
the window you know

<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#59:1:A>
So if they they wanted to like cover her face <unclear> word
</unclear>

<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#60:1:A>
Okay that's fine

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#61:1:B>
Then

<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#62:1:B>
Then after that

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#63:1:A>
You can't see her because she cut to her legs walking and then
cut to her shot of her at the table already you see

<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#64:1:A>
The next thing you know they cut to this shot of her where the
camera was taking by the side

<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#65:1:A>
So it's already quite dark you know the glow

<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#66:1:A>
Uh you know the glare and all that is no longer there you know and
you could see the mother

<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#67:1:A>
You could see the mother and then she says Ah Seng uh you know come

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#68:1:B>
What's the point like that

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#69:1:A>
You see

<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#70:1:A>
No see so for for me I thought that this is nothing you know I
thought that there was no attempt actually you know to to hide their face you
know

<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#71:1:A>
Then when the interview came on it was in dark silhouette and the
woman was speaking very emotionally

<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#72:1:A>
She cried you see

<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#73:1:A>
You know what I mean or not

<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#74:1:A>
She's speaking and then she was crying you see

<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#75:1:A>
Then you knew oh no she was supposed to hide the woman's face

<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#76:1:A>
But how come I saw

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#77:1:B>
Maybe you should ask Archie

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#78:1:A>
Must you know

<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#79:1:A>
I I'm going to tell

<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#80:1:A>
I'm I think it's ethical problem because I I

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#81:1:B>
Unless the lady agreed to be filmed later on

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#82:1:A>
I can put me off

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#83:1:B>
Or either that or she

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#84:1:A>
No but if she agreed

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#85:1:B>
didn't she didn't tell her what she's filming

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#86:1:A>
It's bluff lah come on you know

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#87:1:B>
That's quite

<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#88:1:B>
It's very unfair to the family what

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#89:1:A>
It's very unfair and then never mind you know

<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#90:1:A>
Okay then you see you know

<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#91:1:A>
There's this uhm then after that they cut away to the mother
talking about her

<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#92:1:A>
The her her psycho son right

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#93:1:B>
Uhm

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#94:1:A>
So he he's at the void deck you know downstairs you know those
stone seats

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#95:1:B>
Ya ya

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#96:1:A>
So he's puffing away you see

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#97:1:B>
Ah then

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#98:1:A>
So they cut to this wide shot he's alone talking to himself
smoking wide shot but the angle the camera is high you see

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#99:1:B>
Uh huh

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#100:1:A>
And you can see the man's face

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#101:1:B>
<O> laughs </O>

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#102:1:A>
You see and then later they cut to his eyes then they cut to
his his hands holding the cigarettes

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#103:1:B>
And then you can see the face

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#104:1:A>
Then slowly it's like photo fade

<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#105:1:A>
You're beginning to see the whole face you know

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#106:1:B>
Then what's the point

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#107:1:A>
I was so disgusted you know and then they cut from another
part

<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#108:1:A>
Okay where he's talking to himself in hawker centre okay

<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#109:1:A>
She took a back shot so obviously she didn't want to show his face

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#110:1:B>
But in in terms of dealing with issues was it

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#111:1:A>
I was so upset with that I didn't even think much of the
issues you know

<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#112:1:A>
So I was I was thinking it's so disgusting you know and the
problem is is

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#113:1:B>
Is the whole series over

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#114:1:A>
No over already

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#115:1:B>
How many

<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#116:1:B>
Three only uh

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#117:1:A>
Three

<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#118:1:A>
The divorce one just finished

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#119:1:B>
How was the divorce one

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#120:1:A>
I don't know lah but you know very depressing lah

<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#121:1:A>
Entire three-week you know the way they did the trainers you know

<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#122:1:A>
Whoa very sad

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#123:1:B>
That's the way it is what

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#124:1:A>
But anyway the the mentally ill one in terms of issues

<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#125:1:A>
I felt that I didn't learn anything more

<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#126:1:A>
It's like the usual things that you would ask the old you know
mentally ill people

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#127:1:B>
How you cope the difficulty

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#128:1:A>
No no no not how they cope you know but uhm how how

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#129:1:B>
<unclear> word </unclear>

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#130:1:A>
difficult it is for them to like <unclear> word </unclear>

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#131:1:B>
That's all lah

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#132:1:A>
You see

<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#133:1:A>
But then it wasn't well-rounded because they kept on saying you
know from from the perspective

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#134:1:B>
So it's just milking sympathy

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#135:1:A>
Ya because they kept on saying that these poor chaps

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#136:1:B>
Not not hard

<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#137:1:B>
Hard look lah at at the

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#138:1:A>
You know uh uh employers don't want to give them a a a a job
you know

<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#139:1:A>
Poor things and all that you see

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#140:1:B>
So it's just like mental illness awareness kind of thing

<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#141:1:B>
Nothing deeper

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#142:1:A>
They didn't get the

<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#143:1:A>
They didn't get employers' point of view on why certain mentally
ill people

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#144:1:B>
They're looking into it

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#145:1:A>
May not be suitable

<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#146:1:A>
That is the one you know

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#147:1:B>
They're doing

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#148:1:A>
You must have an answer

<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#149:1:A>
Your docu can't be one-sided what

<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#150:1:A>
But in the end you all saying that ya these poor chaps you know

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#151:1:B>
Ya

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#152:1:A>
Trying so

<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#153:1:A>
Having ya having a hard time you know

<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#154:1:A>
Can't integrate into society

<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#155:1:A>
It's all their fault

<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#156:1:A>
So I I I don't know lah

<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#157:1:A>
I

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#158:1:B>
Ah I went for the health screening just now

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#159:1:A>

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#160:1:B>
Cholesterol level safe

<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#161:1:A>
Really

<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#162:1:A>
Are they still having it on now

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#163:1:B>
No more already

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#164:1:A>
Aiyoh

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#165:1:B>
But I paid five dollars

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#166:1:A>
I wanted to you know

<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#167:1:A>
I called you at nine-thirty

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#168:1:B>
I went down already

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#169:1:A>
I know

<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#170:1:A>
I called you

<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#171:1:A>
Then see how much blood did they

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#172:1:B>
One jar

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#173:1:A>
A lot uh

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#174:1:B>
No lah

<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#175:1:B>
One tube uh

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#176:1:A>
One tube

<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#177:1:A>
That's a lot

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#178:1:B>
Just to find out the sugar and the cholesterol lah

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#179:1:A>
Aiyah I should have gone

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#180:1:B>
And the the what it was so messy don't know whether the
reading's correct

<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#181:1:B>
Whether it is really my reading or somebody else's

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#182:1:A>
But the needles are all disposables right

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#183:1:B>
I hope so

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#184:1:A>
No they are

<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#185:1:A>
My brother says now they have all moved towards disposables
already

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#186:1:B>
I'm sure there are a number of HIV positive people there

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#187:1:A>
Ya eeeee

<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#188:1:A>
No but if you

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#189:1:B>
You should have tested for AIDs on the <unclear> word
</unclear> uh

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#190:1:A>
Uh no lah

<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#191:1:A>
What for

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#192:1:B>
Then people won't know you see

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#193:1:A>
No if they do that our dear Bachtiar will be most

<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#194:1:A>
Oh he's on leave don't worry

<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#195:1:A>
He'll be most aghast

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#196:1:B>
Why

<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#197:1:B>
He doesn't want to know

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#198:1:A>
No he says that it's it's an intrusion invasion of a person's
privacy if you just test for HIV without asking for permission which is true
lah you see

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#199:1:B>
No but I think as long as you go to a government clinic and
you know that they are going to test for HIV then you're

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#200:1:A>
Then it's okay

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#201:1:B>
You have no right already

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#202:1:A>
Ya you've you you know that definitely <unclear> word
</unclear>

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#203:1:B>
You go there knowing what

<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#204:1:B>
Ya

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#205:1:A>
But then again then they'll say Why in the first place must
the government you know do that

<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#206:1:A>
That means whenever you test for blood they will test for HIV also

<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#207:1:A>
I mean like you go and say you go and say

<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#208:1:A>
Can you test my blood level

<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#209:1:A>
Can you test cholesterol

<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#210:1:A>
But you know how how this based on you you see

<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#211:1:A>
You give them permission test for blood test for I mean test for
sugar test for cholesterol

<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#212:1:A>
But you don't say if you say don't test for HIV they can't

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#213:1:B>
Then don't go to a government clinic uh

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#214:1:A>
Huh

<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#215:1:A>
Aiyah I don't know lah

<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#216:1:A>
This HIV thing is so

<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#217:1:A>
Actually there are so many issues you know

<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#218:1:A>
Even if you talk about AIDs you know

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#219:1:B>
Uhm uhm

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#220:1:A>
You know the docu that you did

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#221:1:B>
Uhm

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#222:1:A>
Okay that's one part

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#223:1:B>
That's only one part only

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#224:1:A>
Ya docu cannot you know do everything

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#225:1:B>
There's a lot more

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#226:1:A>
Ya but but

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#227:1:B>
Thought of looking into rights and all that

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#228:1:A>
Ya like like this thing that you just brought up

<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#229:1:A>
You see I mean on the one hand Bachtiar does have a point to make
you see

<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#230:1:A>
I mean no matter what you have a right to say that what my body
should be tested for

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#231:1:B>
Uhm

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#232:1:A>
You know what I mean or not

<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#233:1:A>
If if you don't want to know whether you got cancer or not you
know you you you just don't test for it

<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#234:1:A>
They can't test you without your permission you see you know

<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#235:1:A>
But then uh on the other hand there are other you know things lah

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#236:1:B>
I think they should set up anonymous testing

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#237:1:A>
Uhm that's what he suggested

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#238:1:B>
Anonymous testing

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#239:1:A>
Ya

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#240:1:B>
In other words

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#241:1:A>
But then you see

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#242:1:B>
You you don't leave you don't even leave your name you know

<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#243:1:B>
You don't leave your name

<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#244:1:B>
You record uh

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#245:1:A>
Oh then you go back and

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#246:1:B>
You just go there they give you a number

<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#247:1:B>
Then you just quote that number

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#248:1:A>
Okay okay then after that the government how they're going
trace you

<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#249:1:A>
If you are HIV positive

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#250:1:B>
They can't trace you they can't trace you

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#251:1:A>
Then you you go and say Oh I got HIV positive

<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#252:1:A>
Go back and and feel very sad about it but you go on you know you
don't undergo counselling

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#253:1:B>
No they have counselling

<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#254:1:B>
They have counselling

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#255:1:A>
No how can they undergo counselling when you don't give your
name

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#256:1:B>
No

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#257:1:A>
You can just say Oh I I I <unclear> word </unclear>

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#258:1:B>
You have to come back and get your results

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#259:1:A>
Yes

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-022#260:1:B>
When you come back before you go for your testing they'll
counsel you because some people go there to test whether whether there's
