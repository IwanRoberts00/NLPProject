<h> Statement of the Problem </h>

<ICE-SIN:W1A-005#2:1>
How closely do editors' perceptions of readers' interest agree with
their own news interest and is perceived news coverage related more to
editors' own news intrest or more to their perceptions of readers' interest?

<ICE-SIN:W1A-005#3:1>
<h> Definitions of terms </h>

<ICE-SIN:W1A-005#4:1>
I thereby quote the definition of 'perceptions' from Petty and
Cacioppo in 'Attitudes and Persuasion' as 'something people beleive to be
true, and which people often act on'.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-005#5:1>
Degree of closeness is measured on the basis of congruency, i.e. the
extent to which newspapers editors' interest agreed with what they thought
would interest their readers.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-005#6:1>
Editors refer to those working in the daily newspapers in the United
States.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-005#7:1>
News coverage is viewed in terms of adequacy as in total story length
in column inches.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-005#8:1>
The news under analysis is classified under the categories as
outlined: government, business, sports, foreign affairs, crime,
military/defence, foreign news, human interest, law/justice, fashion/food,
arts/entertainment and politics.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-005#9:1>
Thus, to conclude, the problem is to find out 'The extent to which
newspapers editor' interest agreed with what they thought would interest
their readers in the different news categories such as government, business,
sports, foreign affairs, crime, military/defence, foreign news, human
interest, law/justice, fashion/food, arts/entertainment and politics and to
see how adequacy of the news covered is related the editors' own interest and
the readers' interest as predicted and believed to be true by the editors.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-005#10:1>
<h> Selecting the Topic </h>

<ICE-SIN:W1A-005#11:1>
The initial research topic outline I proposed was relatively wide in
scope - - - from newsgathering, agenda-setting of the press to the judgement
of the importance of news by the news media, i.e. gatekeeping.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-005#12:1>
The reason why I chose this area of research is my deep interest in
the workings of the press.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-005#13:1>
Besides, this might be of help in my future career as a journalist.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-005#14:1>
After learning that chapter 13 in our Lowery and DeFleur text is
entirely devoted to the agenda-setting function of the press, I soon thought
it natural to narrow the focus of my proposal to this aspect of research.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-005#15:1>
Although, the text provided the main source of material for my
research, it was not easy, as I discovered later, to find the relevant
literature from the central library.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-005#16:1>
Firstly, I did not know how to begin searching for the right
materials from the wide collection of reference books available at the
library.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-005#17:1>
I was particularly groping in the dark with no help from any of my
friends ( many of my friends do not take mass communication as their
subject).

<ICE-SIN:W1A-005#18:1>
Secondly, I was afraid because I was left very much on my own and it
was horrible each time I thought that none of my tutorial mates had chosen
the same topic for research - - - as it meant that there would be no sharing
of research findings and, of course, woes together.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-005#19:1>
Somehow, the definition of 'agenda-setting' by McCombs as 'the focus
set by the media by telling us what is important and what to think about (
though not necessarily what to think about)', struck me as a hint that I
should start searching for materials pertaining to the cognitive and
psychological aspect of mass communication.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-005#20:1>
Although, I managed to find some reference materials on this subject;
for example a book that I found called 'A Cognitive Psychology of Mass
Communication' by Richard Jackson Harris, I was still unable to relate them
to the main topic of agenda-setting.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-005#21:1>
I was thus forced to review chapter 13 in the text again.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-005#22:1>
It was then that I discovered that many of the studies done were
focused on both media presentation of the political issues and voter
perceptions of the significance of those issues.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-005#23:1>
The Charlotte study is one fine example.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-005#24:1>
On top of that, there was some mention of another form of media
content - - - political advertising by the candidates.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-005#25:1>
I thought things would be running smoothly for me this time because
the coming general elections came in all too timely.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-005#26:1>
Besides, this would tie in perfectly with my study of the
agenda-setting function of the press.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-005#27:1>
However, after the reports in the general election to my research, my
efforts still did not yield any satisfactory results.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-005#28:1>
The final straw that led to a slight change in my research topic was
when I stumbled upon a book called 'Mass Communication and Political
Information Processing' by Sidney Kraus.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-005#29:1>
An article from the book titled 'News for the Other Person: Editors'
Processing of Readers' Interest' by Tsan-Kuo Chang and Sidney Kraus hence
contributed largely to the formulation of my final research proposal.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-005#30:1>
The whole focus of the analysis is now shifted back to one of the
aspects of the research outline proposed earlier, i.e. gatekeeping.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-005#31:1>
I do not regard this as a complete diversion from agenda-setting;
rather, I would consider it as part of the process because agenda-setting is
in itself a complex process of news selection, newsgathering and delivery.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-005#32:1>
In addition,it is afterall the gatekeeping function of the editors
that shape the content of the news and affect the levels of importance
suggested by the media.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-005#33:1>
All in all, it took me about 2 weeks to arrive at the final statement
of the problem.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-005#34:1>
<h> Literature Review </h>

<ICE-SIN:W1A-005#35:1>
A Review of primary resources.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-005#36:1>
The main source of material for my research was from the book titled 'Mass
Communication and Political Processing' edited by Sidney Kraus.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-005#37:1>
An article written by Sidney Kraus et al titled 'News for the Other
Person: Editors' Processing of Readers' Interest' thus formed the basis of my
research topic.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-005#38:1>
The article contains a comperhensive summary of many studies done in
the past, and gives an overview of these studies and their results.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-005#39:1>
However, 'the purpose of this chapter is to determine how newspaper
editors across the country perceive their readers' interest in the news1 and
whether the perceptions relate to perceived coverage of various news
categories.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-005#40:1>
Specifically, the following research questions were addressed: What
did newspapers editors think of their readers' interest in the news?

<ICE-SIN:W1A-005#41:1>
How closely did editors' perceptions of readers' interest agree with
their own news interest?

<ICE-SIN:W1A-005#42:1>
What factors affected editors' perceptions of readers news interest?

<ICE-SIN:W1A-005#43:1>
Was perceived news coverage related more to editors' own news
interest or more to their perceptions of readers interest?'

<ICE-SIN:W1A-005#44:1>
<h> METHOD </h>

<ICE-SIN:W1A-005#45:1>
The study was carried out in the form of a mail survey in which a
national sample of 550 daily newspapers was randomly selected from the 1987
Editor And Publisher International Yearbook.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-005#46:1>
However, the final sample was 540 newspapers after eleiminating 10
papers which either merged or shared the same editorial staff with other
larger papers in the sample.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-005#47:1>
A 6-page questionaire, composed mostly of multiple-choice questions
was mailed to the editor of each newspaper in mid-December 1987.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-005#48:1>
'In the questionaire, editors were asked, among other things, to rate
their readers' interest in each of the following news categories: government,
business/finance, politics, sports, U.S.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-005#49:1>
foreign affairs, crime/violence, military/defence, foreign news,
human interest, law/justice, fashion/food/living, and arts/entertainment.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-005#50:1>
Editors indicated their readers' interests in each of the news
categories on a 5-point scale, with 1 representing 'not at all very
interested'.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-005#51:1>
On a similar 5-point scale, editors were asked how interested they
were personally in the same 12 news categories.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-005#52:1>
'To measure coverage of the 12 news categories, editors were asked to
rate their newspaper's overall coverage of those categories on a 5-point
scale, with 1 representing 'not at all adequate' and 5 representing 'very
adequate.'

<ICE-SIN:W1A-005#53:1>
The perceived adequacy of coverage by editors may serve as indicators
of how the 12 news categories were covered in the editors' newspapers.'

<ICE-SIN:W1A-005#54:1>
Measures used in the study included newspaper circulation, region,
editors' political leanings, party affiliation, education, presence of
competing newspapers, and editor's years of working experience.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-005#55:1>
<h> RESULTS </h>

<ICE-SIN:W1A-005#56:1>
There is incongruency between editors' own interest and the perceived
readers' interest.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-005#57:1>
This can be best seen in the overall rankings of the 12 categories in
Table 7.2.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-005#58:1>
On the whole, editors considered themselves to be more interested in
the following news categories: government, politics, business, foreign
affairs, military/defence, foreign news, and law/justice.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-005#59:1>
On the other hand, they perceived their readers to be interested than
they were in sports, crime, human interest, fashion/food/living, and
arts/entertainment.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-005#60:1>
As is evident, the differences between editors' own interest and the
perceived readers' interest seem to follow a conventionalclassification of
news: hard news versus soft news.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-005#61:1>
Editors rated their own interest to be high in hard news and
perceived their readers to be mostly interested in soft news.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-005#62:1>
Results of the coverage of the 12 news categories in the newspapers
are reported in Table 7.3.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-005#63:1>
The results show that there appears to be no relationship between
editors' interest in the news and the ratings of their newspapers' overall
coverage of news.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-005#64:1>
Instead, it appears that perceived readers' news interest is related
to the overall amount of coverage rated by the editors.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-005#65:1>
This finding implies that editors gave what their readers asked for
2.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-005#66:1>
Table 7.2.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-005#67:1>
Table 7.3.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-005#68:1>
The next source of material is an article 'Opinion Agreement and
Accuracy Between Editors and their Readers' from Journalism Quarterly, 49 by
Martin et al.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-005#69:1>
( 1972).

<ICE-SIN:W1A-005#70:1>
They Provided evidence suggesting that editors perceived readers'
interest fairly well and the perceptions influenced their news decision
making.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-005#71:1>
Moreover, individual opinions of editors were found to affect choice
of stories.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-005#72:1>
The study, based on a co-orientation model, explored a number of
questions.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-005#73:1>
The questions posed were centred around a selected controversial news
event and were basically interested in finding out whether the positions held
by the public as perceived by the daily newspaper editors are accurate with
respect to that news event.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-005#74:1>
In addition, they also wanted to find out 'whether the stated
positions of daily newspaper editors concerning a controversial news event
have any pattern consistent with the emphasis in the treatment editors gave
to news stories of the event.'

<ICE-SIN:W1A-005#75:1>
The news event selected was about a campus demonstration staged by
black students at the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 1969.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-005#76:1>
An analysis of headline content was made to see the revealing
patterns of editor attitude.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-005#77:1>
Control measures included the selection of a panel of judges from
diverse backgrounds.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-005#78:1>
The data revealed the belief on the part of the judges that a strong
majority of the headlines about the event were neutral.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-005#79:1>
The results also showed that the pattern of responses regarding the
opinion questions was quite similar between editors and readers.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-005#80:1>
On top of that, 'there is no consistent pattern regarding the
editors' stated positions and the amount of attention given to news stories
of the event.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-005#81:1>
However, there appears to be a discernible association between the
Wisconsin editors' perception of their readers' beliefs and the direction of
the stories that appeared in their newspapers.'

<ICE-SIN:W1A-005#82:1>
Therefore, we see from this study, that editors do perceive their
readers' interest and that perceived news coverage is related more to the
perceived readers' interest.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-005#83:1>
Hence, this is in agreement with the results of the first work, that
is, editors gave what their readers asked for.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-005#84:1>
The third work is an article titled 'Influence of Editors, Readers,
and Personal Opinions on Reporters' taken from Journalism Quarterly, 48 by
Flegel et al.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-005#85:1>
( 1971).

<ICE-SIN:W1A-005#86:1>
The study focuses mainly on the gatekeeping functions of reporters
and 'attempted to assess the influences that guide news selection by
reporters.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-005#87:1>
The 3 external factors are: the reporters' own opinion, his
perception of his editor's opinions, and his perception of his readers'
opinions.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-005#88:1>
2 daily newpapers of Madison, Wisconsin were selected for the study,
namely the more conservative Wisconsin State Journal ( WSJ) and the liberal
paper, Capital Times ( CT).

<ICE-SIN:W1A-005#89:1>
Results show that reporters tended to cover news according to their
own opinions and the perceptions of readers' views were less influential in
their reporting.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-005#90:1>
Moreover, for both daily newspapers, it was found that for both news
and feature stories, the order of influence described by the reporters was
the same:

<ICE-SIN:W1A-005#91:1>
'they feel that their own opinions guide their reporting more than do
those of their editors; readers' opinions are even less important.' ( p.649)

<ICE-SIN:W1A-005#92:1>
The above study focuses on reporters and not on editors.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-005#93:1>
Reporters

<ICE-SIN:W1A-005#94:1>
in this instance, form the first 'gate' in the process of
communication. <X>

<ICE-SIN:W1A-005#X95:1>
They are the ones who provide most of what editors edit.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-005#X96:1>
It is also of interest to note that, there is no mention of the
coverage of news or the editors' interest.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-005#X97:1>
Therefore, the study did not contribute very much to the problem I
am studying, but it confirms one thing though, that is readers' interest as
perceived by reporters are not influential in their reporting. </X> </I>
