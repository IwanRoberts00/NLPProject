<ICE-SIN:S2B-022#1:1> <X> GOH CHOK TONG'S NATIONAL DAY RALLY SPEECH 1998 </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S2B-022#2:1:A>
We are in for some very tough times

<ICE-SIN:S2B-022#3:1:A>
The currency crisis started in Thailand in July last year

<ICE-SIN:S2B-022#4:1:A>
It then spread quickly to the rest of the region

<ICE-SIN:S2B-022#5:1:A>
In some countries the financial and economic problems triggered off
social and political upheavals

<ICE-SIN:S2B-022#6:1:A>
The turmoil has gone on for more than a year now but the end is
still not in sight

<ICE-SIN:S2B-022#7:1:A>
Matters are likely to get worse before they get better

<ICE-SIN:S2B-022#8:1:A>
We must prepare ourselves for a gloomy scenario

<ICE-SIN:S2B-022#9:1:A>
Continued difficulties in the region will mean minimal growth for
Singapore over the next 1 to 2 years

<ICE-SIN:S2B-022#10:1:A>
We need to be realistic about the prospects

<ICE-SIN:S2B-022#11:1:A>
But there is no reason to be despondent

<ICE-SIN:S2B-022#12:1:A>
We have the resources and resolve to withstand the external shocks

<ICE-SIN:S2B-022#13:1:A>
We do not have the weaknesses of the badly affected economies

<ICE-SIN:S2B-022#14:1:A>
But we need to organise ourselves to weather the storm and use this
period to gain a head start for the race ahead after the storm has subsided

<ICE-SIN:S2B-022#15:1:A>
Steering through this storm to safety is Singapore's biggest
challenge since I became Prime Minister eight years ago

<ICE-SIN:S2B-022#16:1:A>
Fortunately I have a capable and steady team of ministers permanent
secretaries and senior civil servants

<ICE-SIN:S2B-022#17:1:A>
But they cannot do this job by themselves

<ICE-SIN:S2B-022#18:1:A>
They need your co-operation and support to succeed

<ICE-SIN:S2B-022#19:1:A>
<h> Genesis of the regional crisis </h>

<ICE-SIN:S2B-022#20:1:A>
Let me go back to how the regional crisis started and how we got
sucked in

<ICE-SIN:S2B-022#21:1:A>
<h> Thailand </h>

<ICE-SIN:S2B-022#22:1:A>
Thailand was one of the new economic tigers

<ICE-SIN:S2B-022#23:1:A>
Last year in June when I visited Thailand the signs of trouble were
there though they were not yet obvious

<ICE-SIN:S2B-022#24:1:A>
I saw scores of magnificent new buildings many unoccupied in
Bangkok

<ICE-SIN:S2B-022#25:1:A>
There were large tracts of newly-prepared but vacant industrial
sites at the Eastern Seaboard

<ICE-SIN:S2B-022#26:1:A>
The Thai baht had run into trouble in May

<ICE-SIN:S2B-022#27:1:A>
The ministers could not agree on how to handle the problem

<ICE-SIN:S2B-022#28:1:A>
On the last day of my visit Prime Minister Chavalit hosted me to a
golf game along with his Finance Minister Amnuay Virawan

<ICE-SIN:S2B-022#29:1:A>
During the game Chavalit whispered to me that he was trying to
persuade Amnuay not to resign

<ICE-SIN:S2B-022#30:1:A>
Later I spoke to Amnuay

<ICE-SIN:S2B-022#31:1:A>
He confirmed that it was true

<ICE-SIN:S2B-022#32:1:A>
He had held back his announcement out of courtesy to me

<ICE-SIN:S2B-022#33:1:A>
Immediately after the golf game

<ICE-SIN:S2B-022#34:1:A>
Amnuay met the press to announce his resignation

<ICE-SIN:S2B-022#35:1:A>
Thai companies had borrowed too much in US dollars

<ICE-SIN:S2B-022#36:1:A>
They spent the money on property projects which earned Thai baht
not US dollars

<ICE-SIN:S2B-022#37:1:A>
This was all right provided the projects were sound and the baht
exchange rate was stable

<ICE-SIN:S2B-022#38:1:A>
Unfortunately both assumptions turned out to be wrong

<ICE-SIN:S2B-022#39:1:A>
Many of the projects were not sound

<ICE-SIN:S2B-022#40:1:A>
The property boom had become a dangerous bubble

<ICE-SIN:S2B-022#41:1:A>
Thai banking supervision was weak

<ICE-SIN:S2B-022#42:1:A>
Nobody stopped banks and finance companies from risky lending

<ICE-SIN:S2B-022#43:1:A>
In fact many lent to their owners relatives and friends

<ICE-SIN:S2B-022#44:1:A>
As the Thai economy weakened the baht became over-valued

<ICE-SIN:S2B-022#45:1:A>
Fund managers and currency speculators saw an opportunity

<ICE-SIN:S2B-022#46:1:A>
They bet that the baht would go down and sold the baht short

<ICE-SIN:S2B-022#47:1:A>
The Bank of Thailand spent US$20 billion in a futile attempt to
defend the Thai baht

<ICE-SIN:S2B-022#48:1:A>
Eventually it ran out of US dollars and gave up

<ICE-SIN:S2B-022#49:1:A>
The Thai baht immediately depreciated by 17 percent to 29 baht per
US dollar

<ICE-SIN:S2B-022#50:1:A>
Today the Thai baht is 42 baht to one US dollar down by 42 per cent

<ICE-SIN:S2B-022#51:1:A>
When the baht fell companies which could not pay back the US
dollars went bust

<ICE-SIN:S2B-022#52:1:A>
Foreign lenders recalled their loans

<ICE-SIN:S2B-022#53:1:A>
Thai banks and finance companies were left with huge amounts of bad
debt and became insolvent

<ICE-SIN:S2B-022#54:1:A>
The whole financial system was shaken

<ICE-SIN:S2B-022#55:1:A>
The economy almost collapsed Thailand had no choice but to call in
the IMF

<ICE-SIN:S2B-022#56:1:A>
<h> Contagion </h>

<ICE-SIN:S2B-022#57:1:A>
The Thai collapse scared investors and bankers who had invested or
lent money in Indonesia South Korea and Malaysia

<ICE-SIN:S2B-022#58:1:A>
They rushed to pull back loans and investments

<ICE-SIN:S2B-022#59:1:A>
The rupiah won and ringgit went down like the baht

<ICE-SIN:S2B-022#60:1:A>
Their economies came to a sudden halt

<ICE-SIN:S2B-022#61:1:A>
Malaysia did not have huge foreign debts but its domestic debt was
large nearly twice its GDP

<ICE-SIN:S2B-022#62:1:A>
Many foreign investors had invested in Malaysian shares

<ICE-SIN:S2B-022#63:1:A>
When they lost confidence in Malaysia and sold the shares the Kuala
Lumpur Stock Exchange crashed

<ICE-SIN:S2B-022#64:1:A>
Many companies had borrowed heavily from banks against their shares

<ICE-SIN:S2B-022#65:1:A>
Their collateral was reduced to a fraction of the value they had
pledged to the banks

<ICE-SIN:S2B-022#66:1:A>
The companies became insolvent The banks' non-performing loans went
up dangerously high

<ICE-SIN:S2B-022#67:1:A>
Singapore companies on the whole have not borrowed excessively
whether in US dollars or Singapore dollars

<ICE-SIN:S2B-022#68:1:A>
Our banking system is sound

<ICE-SIN:S2B-022#69:1:A>
But the Singapore dollar also went down against the US dollar
although by less

<ICE-SIN:S2B-022#70:1:A>
Our economy is so interlinked with our neighbours that their
problems inevitably affect us

<ICE-SIN:S2B-022#71:1:A>
When Latin America was hit by a financial crisis in 1994 investment
analysts called it the " tequila" shock

<ICE-SIN:S2B-022#72:1:A>
That crisis had originated from Mexico well known for its punchy
tequila

<ICE-SIN:S2B-022#73:1:A>
For the Asian crisis they called the contagion the " tom-yam"
effect

<ICE-SIN:S2B-022#74:1:A>
But the tom-yam soup was very spicy

<ICE-SIN:S2B-022#75:1:A>
Unlike the tequila hangover which went away after one year the
tom-yam effect has remained

<ICE-SIN:S2B-022#76:1:A>
Now some call the crisis an Asian flu

<ICE-SIN:S2B-022#77:1:A>
But the strain is apparently resistant to the antibiotics
prescribed by the IMF

<ICE-SIN:S2B-022#78:1:A>
<h> Indonesia </h>

<ICE-SIN:S2B-022#79:1:A>
What has happened in Indonesia is a major tragedy

<ICE-SIN:S2B-022#80:1:A>
The rupiah today is worth only one-fifth of what it was against the
US dollar last June

<ICE-SIN:S2B-022#81:1:A>
The banking system has almost collapsed

<ICE-SIN:S2B-022#82:1:A>
The economy is expected to contract by 15% this year

<ICE-SIN:S2B-022#83:1:A>
90 million Indonesians nearly half the population are living below
the poverty line that is on less than S$30 a month

<ICE-SIN:S2B-022#84:1:A>
40 million face the threat of starvation

<ICE-SIN:S2B-022#85:1:A>
The May riots will put Indonesia back by many years

<ICE-SIN:S2B-022#86:1:A>
The Indonesian Chinese minority community bore the brunt of the
violence

<ICE-SIN:S2B-022#87:1:A>
Media reports have drawn international attention to what happened

<ICE-SIN:S2B-022#88:1:A>
Hundreds of internet websites are carrying " yellow ribbons" to
demand justice for the victims of what is widely believed to be organised
lawlessness

<ICE-SIN:S2B-022#89:1:A>
Many Indonesian Chinese and foreigners fled Indonesia in terror

<ICE-SIN:S2B-022#90:1:A>
Some have not returned

<ICE-SIN:S2B-022#91:1:A>
Others went back only to salvage what was left of their businesses
but not to rebuild or re-invest

<ICE-SIN:S2B-022#92:1:A>
TVRI showed retailers selling their wares outside burnt-out shops

<ICE-SIN:S2B-022#93:1:A>
<h> Wong Kwei Cheong's Story </h>

<ICE-SIN:S2B-022#94:1:A>
The Indonesian tragedy struck home vividly when I learnt of what
happened to Wong Kwei Cheong our former MP for Cairnhill

<ICE-SIN:S2B-022#95:1:A>
After leaving NUS he poured his energy and capital into investments
in Indonesia

<ICE-SIN:S2B-022#96:1:A>
He started several factories in Indonesia with a Japanese partner
to produce TVs video cassette players and other electronic goods

<ICE-SIN:S2B-022#97:1:A>
He did well and built up a chain of distributors

<ICE-SIN:S2B-022#98:1:A>
Like most companies he borrowed foreign currency to finance his
investments in Indonesia

<ICE-SIN:S2B-022#99:1:A>
His products were sold in Indonesia

<ICE-SIN:S2B-022#100:1:A>
He borrowed at about 2 500 rupiah per US dollar

<ICE-SIN:S2B-022#101:1:A>
At 5 000 rupiah he could still survive

<ICE-SIN:S2B-022#102:1:A>
But beyond that it was impossible

<ICE-SIN:S2B-022#103:1:A>
His distributors owed him money

<ICE-SIN:S2B-022#104:1:A>
They could not repay and offered to do so with their shops

<ICE-SIN:S2B-022#105:1:A>
I advised Wong Kwei Cheong against taking over the shops

<ICE-SIN:S2B-022#106:1:A>
I told him " You will lose them there will be social unrest"

<ICE-SIN:S2B-022#107:1:A>
That was in February

<ICE-SIN:S2B-022#108:1:A>
He said that he had no choice

<ICE-SIN:S2B-022#109:1:A>
Also he intended to build up his own chain of shops to distribute
his products

<ICE-SIN:S2B-022#110:1:A>
Unfortunately I was right

<ICE-SIN:S2B-022#111:1:A>
Many of his shops were looted and burnt

<ICE-SIN:S2B-022#112:1:A>
He has suffered a severe setback but he will bounce back

<ICE-SIN:S2B-022#113:1:A>
I have confidence in him

<ICE-SIN:S2B-022#114:1:A>
<h> A Singaporean Victim </h>

<ICE-SIN:S2B-022#115:1:A>
I also received a letter from a 65 year old retiree recounting how
a close relative a Singaporean suffered the same fate during the Jakarta May
riots

<ICE-SIN:S2B-022#116:1:A>
His relative a young entrepreneur had built up a sizeable food
distribution business in Jakarta " after tears and sweat for five years" as
he put it

<ICE-SIN:S2B-022#117:1:A>
On 14 May his relative's two super-markets two coffee houses a
bakery two warehouses an expensive " cold room" three freezer trucks and a
car were looted and set on fire

<ICE-SIN:S2B-022#118:1:A>
His home was also broken into and stripped of its contents

<ICE-SIN:S2B-022#119:1:A>
The retiree wanted the Government to know that there were
Singaporean victims of the May riots and that charity should begin at home

<ICE-SIN:S2B-022#120:1:A>
<h> Helping Indonesia </h>

<ICE-SIN:S2B-022#121:1:A>
I feared the worst for Indonesia when the crisis started

<ICE-SIN:S2B-022#122:1:A>
That is why I visited then President Suharto three times

<ICE-SIN:S2B-022#123:1:A>
I also spoke to President Clinton Prime Minister Hashimoto Prime
Minister John Howard and Chancellor Kohl

<ICE-SIN:S2B-022#124:1:A>
I impressed upon them the seriousness of the Indonesian situation
and urged them to help

<ICE-SIN:S2B-022#125:1:A>
We tried but alas we failed

<ICE-SIN:S2B-022#126:1:A>
All of us pinned hope on the IMF solution in restoring investor
confidence in Indonesia

<ICE-SIN:S2B-022#127:1:A>
On hindsight we should have tried harder to get President Suharto
to understand that signing the Letter of Intent with IMF was only the first
step and that results would show only 6 to 12 months after he had fully
implemented the IMF conditions

<ICE-SIN:S2B-022#128:1:A>
Senior Minister and I knew that President Suharto was not happy
with some of the IMF measures

<ICE-SIN:S2B-022#129:1:A>
We suggested that he appoint Paul Volcker as his adviser to
intervene with the IMF

<ICE-SIN:S2B-022#130:1:A>
Paul Volcker is a former Chairman of the US Federal Reserve Board
with a formidable reputation

<ICE-SIN:S2B-022#131:1:A>
He would have had the standing to argue against the IMF

<ICE-SIN:S2B-022#132:1:A>
The IMF would not lightly dismiss Volcker's views nor would the
market lose confidence if Indonesia followed Volcker's advice instead of the
IMF's

<ICE-SIN:S2B-022#133:1:A>
Paul Volcker was approached

<ICE-SIN:S2B-022#134:1:A>
He visited Indonesia but decided not to take up the appointment

<ICE-SIN:S2B-022#135:1:A>
He must have found the task of helping Indonesia too difficult
given the government's policies at that time

<ICE-SIN:S2B-022#136:1:A>
We have a vested interest in Indonesia's stability growth and
prosperity

<ICE-SIN:S2B-022#137:1:A>
It is our close neighbour and a major trading partner

<ICE-SIN:S2B-022#138:1:A>
We have more than S$4 billion of investments in Indonesia

<ICE-SIN:S2B-022#139:1:A>
In Batam Bintan Karimun Sumatra Java and elsewhere

<ICE-SIN:S2B-022#140:1:A>
Our banks have another S$4 billion in loans to Indonesia

<ICE-SIN:S2B-022#141:1:A>
An Indonesian collapse will hurt us besides scaring off
investments from the wider region

<ICE-SIN:S2B-022#142:1:A>
Singapore will help Indonesia within the limits of our ability

<ICE-SIN:S2B-022#143:1:A>
We are a small economy

<ICE-SIN:S2B-022#144:1:A>
Our GDP <&>  US$82 billion </&> is a mere 1% of the United States GDP <&> 
US$8111 billion </&> and 2% of Japan's GDP <&>  US$4190 billion)

<ICE-SIN:S2B-022#145:1:A>
It is only one fifth of Australia's GDP <&>  US$395 billion)

<ICE-SIN:S2B-022#146:1:A>
We are not in the same class

<ICE-SIN:S2B-022#147:1:A>
After all we are only three million people

<ICE-SIN:S2B-022#148:1:A>
Just a little red dot on the map

<ICE-SIN:S2B-022#149:1:A>
Where is the capacity to help 211 million people

<ICE-SIN:S2B-022#150:1:A>
Whatever we do within our means it should make some real
difference to Indonesia

<ICE-SIN:S2B-022#151:1:A>
We pledged US$5 billion to help Indonesia along with the IMF in
November last year to show confidence in Indonesia

<ICE-SIN:S2B-022#152:1:A>
MAS also participated in joint intervention to support the rupiah
exchange rate

<ICE-SIN:S2B-022#153:1:A>
Unfortunately the intervention was overtaken by events and failed

<ICE-SIN:S2B-022#154:1:A>
We still have several trillion rupiah deposited with Bank
Indonesia

<ICE-SIN:S2B-022#155:1:A>
<h> The Trade Guarantee Scheme </h>

<ICE-SIN:S2B-022#156:1:A>
Singapore is giving humanitarian assistance to Indonesia

<ICE-SIN:S2B-022#157:1:A>
Beyond that our best and most practical contribution now is not to
finance Indonesia's budget deficit or food subsidies through the IMF

<ICE-SIN:S2B-022#158:1:A>
But to help Indonesia restart a part of its economy which has
stalled

<ICE-SIN:S2B-022#159:1:A>
Foreign banks have stopped accepting Letters of Credit issued by
Indonesian banks

<ICE-SIN:S2B-022#160:1:A>
We tried to help with a guarantee scheme

<ICE-SIN:S2B-022#161:1:A>
We sought the support of Indonesia's major trading partners for a
US$20 billion Multilateral Trade Finance Guarantee Scheme

<ICE-SIN:S2B-022#162:1:A>
I wrote to leaders of the G7 plus a few other countries

<ICE-SIN:S2B-022#163:1:A>
From their replies it was clear that most preferred to have their
own bilateral schemes and be in full control of their own funds

<ICE-SIN:S2B-022#164:1:A>
At the request of then President Suharto and his Economic
Ministers Singapore subsequently offered its own Bilateral Trade Finance
Guarantee Scheme <&>  BTFG </&> to Indonesia using the US$5 billion pledged under
the second line financing package with the IMF

<ICE-SIN:S2B-022#165:1:A>
We put up our proposal to Indonesia Officials from both sides held
one meeting in April

<ICE-SIN:S2B-022#166:1:A>
The Indonesians took the proposal back to study

<ICE-SIN:S2B-022#167:1:A>
They commented that the scheme had too many safeguards

<ICE-SIN:S2B-022#168:1:A>
Singapore has no experience at all in trade finance guarantee
schemes

<ICE-SIN:S2B-022#169:1:A>
Safeguards are necessary to prevent unscrupulous traders from
abusing the scheme through fraud and cheating <X>

<ICE-SIN:S2B-022#X170:1:A>
This would not only defeat our objective but harm the reputation
of the scheme and further erode confidence in Indonesia We are taking advice
from experienced international institutions like the World Bank or the Exim
banks of the big exporting countries to learn how to improve on our proposals
without losing discipline and control Guaranteeing trade transactions in an
unstable environment is a risky business The Indonesian newspapers recently
reported that a syndicate of 12 Indonesian banks had been cheated of US$18
million in a trade financing scam The banks only discovered that the imports
were fictitious when the company concerned failed to make payment </X> </I>
