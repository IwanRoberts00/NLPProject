<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#1:1>
<h> LOVE'S LITTLE LEGACY </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#2:1>
I was in the kitchen, poking a satay-stick through the siew-mai I was
steaming when I sensed a presence behind me.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#3:1>
Lee was standing there, his body leaning against the door.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#4:1>
He wasn't looking at me, just at the roses he held in his hands.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#5:1>
I strode to where he was.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#6:1>
" Lee?" I bent down and stared up at his lowered eyes.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#7:1>
" Oh!

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#8:1>
Mei!" He looked startled.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#9:1>
The roses hung limply and the plastic that wrapped them crackled.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#10:1>
I have known Lee for three years and I suppose, knowing him that
long, I'm pretty familiar with his moods.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#11:1>
Right now, he is not too communicative.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#12:1>
Something must be bugging him.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#13:1>
I know well to leave him alone.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#14:1>
" Here," I said, giving him a shove, " you go and rest for a while,
then later I'll scoop you a dish of siew-mai." He nodded and suddenly he was
aware of the flowers he held.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#15:1>
" For you,' he said, thrusting them literally onto me, his eyes fixed
on the flowers, his mind I think probably miles away.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#16:1>
I was somewhere between exclamations of astonishment and ecstasy when
he turned abruptly, dragging his feet into his room.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#17:1>
Mind you, all this time I've known this man of mine, he never buys me
flowers, let alone roses.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#18:1>
To him roses embody passionate love and he is not the passionate
sort.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#19:1>
He probably never heard of Don Juan.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#20:1>
I love flowers.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#21:1>
I love romance.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#22:1>
I used to dream that it'll be lovely if Lee could write me love notes
everyday, but well, one has to be realistic.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#23:1>
His parents like me.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#24:1>
My parents like him.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#25:1>
We love each other.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#26:1>
To everybody, we're a perfect couple.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#27:1>
So suddenly he brings me roses.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#28:1>
I wondered why.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#29:1>
Such demonstrations of affection on his part are rare.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#30:1>
Could he be trying to tell me something?

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#31:1>
That he was sorry about last night's argument?

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#32:1>
We seem to be quarrelling these past few months, petty arguments that
lead nowhere.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#33:1>
I've snapped at him several times about his late nights spent
visiting his friend's sick mother, something I've never got used to.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#34:1>
She was Joe's mother.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#35:1>
Joe was Lee's army pal, perhaps two years older than him but they
were the best of friends.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#36:1>
I remember that day the hospital called.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#37:1>
Joe was involved in an accident and kept asking for Lee.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#38:1>
For five hours Lee had sat at Joe's bedside not uttering a single
word, his hand gripping his friend's.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#39:1>
Joe managed to whisper, " Take care of Mum" before he died.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#40:1>
Lee took it upon himself to visit her, initially a few times a week,
now every evening after work.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#41:1>
Couldn't he have spent the time with me?

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#42:1>
I was jealous, hurt and angry with him for paying her so much
attention.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#43:1>
I knew I shouldn't feel this way but I was afraid, afraid of losing
him.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#44:1>
Somehow I felt that we were drifting further and further apart.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#45:1>
I felt a surge of joy, looking at the roses.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#46:1>
I unwrapped the plastic and prised out the little card buried in
them, the sort you see on the stands during Valentine's Day.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#47:1>
As I opened it, my heart missed a beat.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#48:1>
What could he have written?

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#49:1>
The card read: ` Julie, you make my life more meaningful.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#50:1>
Lee.'

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#51:1>
Julie?

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#52:1>
I stood rooted, my eyes blinked uncomprehendingly at the name.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#53:1>
Who was she?

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#54:1>
Then it struck me.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#55:1>
It hit me so hard that I had to hold onto the chair to stop myself
from blacking out.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#56:1>
It couldn't be.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#57:1>
This happened only in the movies.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#58:1>
Lee loved another girl.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#59:1>
It flashed before me, his moodiness these few months, his sudden
bursts of temper, his lapses into silence.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#60:1>
I thought his late nights were spent visiting Joe's mother.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#61:1>
Now I thought differently.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#62:1>
I gripped the chair hard.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#63:1>
We were planning to marry in six months' time.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#64:1>
The ringing of the phone jolted me.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#65:1>
I stuck the card back into the roses, and walked to the sink.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#66:1>
My hands trembled as I picked up a plate.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#67:1>
I heard his door opening and pretended to dry the plate, anything so
that my back would face him.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#68:1>
" Mei!" He sounded agitated.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#69:1>
As I expected, he headed for the flowers.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#70:1>
" Have you seen the card?" I heard the crackle of the plastic, caught
the fragrance of the roses, and winced inwardly.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#71:1>
" What card?" I tried to hide the undercurrent of anger from creeping
into my voice, tried to stifle it with forced nonchalance.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#72:1>
" I bought two cards .... put the wrong one in.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#73:1>
Sorry.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#74:1>
I'll buy you another next time." The onslaught of tears nearly took
my composure away.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#75:1>
I gripped the dishcloth hard and willed myself to answer him.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#76:1>
" It's okay, Lee.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#77:1>
The flowers ....

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#78:1>
they're more than enough." " Mei ...." I felt Lee staring at me and
was glad I wasn't facing him.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#79:1>
Perhaps he caught the tremor in my voice.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#80:1>
Perhaps he was feeling guilty and wanted to make sure ....Well, what
did he expect me to say?

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#81:1>
It isn't everyday a woman stumbles on the fact that her fiancé is
entangled with another woman.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#82:1>
Waves of self-pity overwhelmed me.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#83:1>
He was my man, yes, was, I had been so sure of him before .... but I
cannot let go like that.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#84:1>
I turned around slowly, fighting for self-control, checking back
fresh tears that threatened to well up in my eyes.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#85:1>
I had to make sure.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#86:1>
I love him too much.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#87:1>
He was staring at the card he held.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#88:1>
" Lee ...." He did not look up.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#89:1>
I clenched my fingers into my palm, forcing every ounce of love and
sincerity into my voice, searching for one last ray of hope.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#90:1>
" Lee ....I love you," I said it softly, meaning every word of it,
hoping to God he'll respond.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#91:1>
He muttered, " I love you too," but it sounded so false, so aloof.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#92:1>
As he slammed the door of his room shut, I burst into tears.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#93:1>
When I stepped out of Lee's flat that night, I was determined to
fight for him.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#94:1>
Call it love, call it a woman's instinct.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#95:1>
I felt he was mine and Julie had no right to him.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#96:1>
I felt cheated and angry, angry with myself for not daring to
confront him with the truth.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#97:1>
But if I did, I knew I wouldn't be able to take it.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#98:1>
Better wild suspicions, then confirmed truth.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#99:1>
I still believed in Lee, still clung to the conviction he wouldn't do
this to me.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#100:1>
I blamed Julie, not the man I love.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#101:1>
So I checked his telephone booklet while he was having his bath.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#102:1>
My fingers trembled as I dialled her number.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#103:1>
" Hello ...." the connection was poor, but the voice that greeted me
was warm and friendly.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#104:1>
" Is Julie Kim in?" I asked, hoping she'll say no ....

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#105:1>
" Yes ...." It was then that my nerves broke.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#106:1>
I hung up the phone.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#107:1>
It's no use.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#108:1>
What do I ask her?

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#109:1>
Is Lee in love with you?

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#110:1>
Did he tell you about me?

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#111:1>
An inner voice had chided me, " Confront her, you fool.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#112:1>
You love him, don't you?

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#113:1>
Well, what are you waiting for?" Another cautioned me, " Don't jump
into conclusions so hastily.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#114:1>
A note does not mean anything.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#115:1>
Think of the times you've shared with him.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#116:1>
Has he ever hidden anything from you?"

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#117:1>
The first voice pounded stronger than ever, it beat away all
reasoning.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#118:1>
" How stupid can you get ?

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#119:1>
Tell me, what did the note say?

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#120:1>
And haven't you noticed his moroseness, his temper lately?

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#121:1>
His fits of despair?

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#122:1>
Now what do all these add up to?" I had to do it.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#123:1>
I had to see her.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#124:1>
I groped for the directory, flipped it to alpha ` K' and brought my
fingers down the listing.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#125:1>
Kim.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#126:1>
Kim Jong Yin.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#127:1>
Kim Julie ....8 Anderson Drive.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#128:1>
It was far from here.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#129:1>
I took a cab and as I alighted, I saw the light blazing from the
window.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#130:1>
An elderly lady, about sixty, answered my knock.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#131:1>
All at once I warmed to her.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#132:1>
Her eyes sparkled, and her smile was friendly, almost welcoming.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#133:1>
Her face radiated a kind of hope, a hope in life.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#134:1>
" Is Julie in?"

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#135:1>
She looked puzzled.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#136:1>
" But I don't know you."

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#137:1>
I shook my head.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#138:1>
" Come in, won't you?" she invited.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#139:1>
" It's cold outside."

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#140:1>
I backed away " I don't want to trouble you, Mrs Kim.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#141:1>
If Julie is not in, I'll come back another day." Mrs Kim chuckled.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#142:1>
It sounded like a thousand bells were chiming.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#143:1>
Her cheeks glowed and I glimpsed a glimmer of mischief dancing in
her eyes.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#144:1>
" Julie?

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#145:1>
Never mind, come in.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#146:1>
She won't be back for a couple of days.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#147:1>
You aren't any of her regular friends.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#148:1>
But come in, here," she motioned me to an oversized sofa, " sit
down, now tell me, why this urgency to see Julie?

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#149:1>
You look very pale, is anything troubling you?" Mrs Kim's eyes were
mirrored with concern.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#150:1>
I was so confused, so lost, I didn't know what to do.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#151:1>
She seemed to sense it.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#152:1>
" You have been friends with Julie a long time?" she asked.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#153:1>
" Yes ...." I stammered, " I mean ....no ...."

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#154:1>
I didn't know, what to tell her.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#155:1>
" Lee ...." I began ....

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#156:1>
Her face lit into a smile.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#157:1>
" You must be Mei.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#158:1>
Lee told me a lot about you." I was startled.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#159:1>
Whatever I expected, it was not this.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#160:1>
" Lee must have explained about the card to you .... or didn't he?"
I shook my head, the words coming out in a rush.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#161:1>
" Mrs Kim ....I love Lee, we were planning to get married soon, then ....then ....your
daughter ...." " My daughter?

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#162:1>
You mean, Lee told you ...." " No, I didn't ask him.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#163:1>
I read the card ....pretended I haven't....then I came here.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#164:1>
I wish I didn't." I was desperate, my nerves were stretched to the
raw and I was appealing to her, hoping she would understand.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#165:1>
When she spoke, her voice was gentle.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#166:1>
" What do you want me to do, Mei?

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#167:1>
Tell Julie not to see Lee again?

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#168:1>
Tell Lee not to come here again?

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#169:1>
Would it be fair?"

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#170:1>
I did not answer her.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#171:1>
Somehow what she said made sense.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#172:1>
" If Lee told you he needed a break, he wanted to think things over ....what
would you do?

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#173:1>
Do you love him enough to let him go?" I didn't think of it this
way.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#174:1>
If he had told me that, I'd probably start an argument with him.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#175:1>
But I didn't tell her that.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#176:1>
It sounded silly.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#177:1>
Do I love him enough to let him go?

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#178:1>
Do I?

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#179:1>
No.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#180:1>
Mrs Kim took hold of my hand and squeezed it.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#181:1>
" Mei, sometimes things are not as bad as you think.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#182:1>
You must rely on your faith in Lee.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#183:1>
That is what makes a relationship last.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#184:1>
If you had asked him, he'd tell you Julie was his close friend ....

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#185:1>
Would you have believed that?

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#186:1>
Is your love strong enough to take this kind of test?

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#187:1>
This is something you have to decide for yourself.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#188:1>
It's coming to terms about your love for Lee.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#189:1>
Nobody can help you, not even Lee.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#190:1>
Love is a funny thing, Mei.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#191:1>
It can make you laugh, sometimes cry, then you'll wonder, is it
worth it?

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#192:1>
Why does he mean so much to me?

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#193:1>
But you know that no matter what happens, you won't exchange this
for anything else ....

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#194:1>
it's an experience you want to feel forever...."

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#195:1>
She smiled sadly.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#196:1>
Her eyes were closed, as if she was reliving a moment in her life.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#197:1>
A very special moment.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#198:1>
She was in a world of her own.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#199:1>
I watched her, sharing her thoughts, my hand in hers.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#200:1>
" I was in love, a long time ago.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#201:1>
It was during the war days.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#202:1>
He was a Japanese soldier and my family hated all Japanese.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#203:1>
My brother had been shot in the head by one of them.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#204:1>
But my soldier was different. <X>

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#X205:1>
He hated the war.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#X206:1>
He wanted to get back to Japan, to see his family.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#X207:1>
He said he would bring me with him ....

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#X208:1>
then I was only nineteen.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#X209:1>
I didn't know' what love was.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-005#X210:1>
He told me love is something you give, and no matter how much you
give, you find there's always some more to give. </X> </I>
