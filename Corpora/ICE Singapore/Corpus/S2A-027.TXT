<ICE-SIN:S2A-027#1:1:A>
It's the uhm latest 32 bit operating system from Microsoft
which will offer you both uh the power and reliability but more importantly
it is an open operating system that is uhm scalable with hardware and
portable across multiple platform

<ICE-SIN:S2A-027#2:1:A>
Uhm in Microsoft we have this internal rating of our product uhm
that is we have products that we develop that we think they are real cool and
we have products that we think that they are way cool but for Windows NT we
think they are absolutely awesome

<ICE-SIN:S2A-027#3:1:A>
Okay we are we are really thrilled with the roll out plan of Windows
NT and particularly with the broad industries report behind Windows NT that
you will get to see when I present my charts itself okay

<ICE-SIN:S2A-027#4:1:A>
So in the next uh thirty minutes or so I'll like to be able to just
go through an overview of Windows NT so that you know uh what Windows NT is
all about what are the benefits it brings to you and hopefully it'll be it
will excite you enough to make sure that you come to my uh Windows NT launch
which is in a couple of months

<ICE-SIN:S2A-027#5:1:A>
So stay tune and look out for the uh the press release or or the
announcement of the launch

<ICE-SIN:S2A-027#6:1:A>
First I'll like to just share with you what is Microsoft system
strategy and what is our key objective

<ICE-SIN:S2A-027#7:1:A>
One we really want to build the Windows uh fam into a family of
products

<ICE-SIN:S2A-027#8:1:A>
You are quite well aware of today that Windows 3.1 is in fact the
defacto standard

<ICE-SIN:S2A-027#9:1:A>
It's selling more than a million copies per month so what and and it
is primarily being uh uh available uh or being run on on a desktop
environment itself

<ICE-SIN:S2A-027#10:1:A>
So what we what to do is really to extend Windows NT's family uh or
rather Windows family to reach the corporate mission critical computing
environment

<ICE-SIN:S2A-027#11:1:A>
And also reach downwards to non PC devices such as office and
consuming uh consumer environment which you will a lot about it in a couple
of months

<ICE-SIN:S2A-027#12:1:A>
So if you will this is really a uh graphical representation of our
system strategy okay

<ICE-SIN:S2A-027#13:1:A>
And uh there are various options by which we could uhm uhm consider
in implementing our Win fab Windows family of products

<ICE-SIN:S2A-027#14:1:A>
One is that we're going to have taken a one size fit all kind of
approach whereby uh we build one implementation of Windows and making sure it
address all the requirements of the user

<ICE-SIN:S2A-027#15:1:A>
Or the another approach is what uh is is to build a single uh
architecture such <unclear> word </unclear> such that it provide a very
consistent look and feel a very consistent programming model

<ICE-SIN:S2A-027#16:1:A>
And also a ability to provide assistance uh consistent underlying
network uh technology so that the idea is that you can have a single
architecture

<ICE-SIN:S2A-027#17:1:A>
But you can implement new technology in the various uhm uh
implement it in various ways such that it will address all the various
specific users' needs okay

<ICE-SIN:S2A-027#18:1:A>
So we have adopted the latter approach and we think it is a uh
unique approach in the market place <unclear> word </unclear>

<ICE-SIN:S2A-027#19:1:A>
Given the ability to spend Windows NT of products from all the way
notebook pen-computing and all the way to a RISC work station and symmetric
multi-processing environment itself

<ICE-SIN:S2A-027#20:1:A>
To the Windows family of products includes Windows 3.1 Windows
workbook NT Windows NT and even the advance server

<ICE-SIN:S2A-027#21:1:A>
They are all complementary products and are not meant to replace
one another itself

<ICE-SIN:S2A-027#22:1:A>
So if you look at Windows and Windows workgroup it is primarily uhm
a the desktop application arena where it focus on the individual PC user uh
enhancing its productivity and being the mainline business application for
the user itself

<ICE-SIN:S2A-027#23:1:A>
Whereas Windows NT is directly a super set of Windows 3.1 or
Windows for workbook if you will

<ICE-SIN:S2A-027#24:1:A>
Okay it is really targeted at the business and technical computing
environment

<ICE-SIN:S2A-027#25:1:A>
It is designed to the client server uh a client server is designed
to the client server operating system providing a high level of uh
functionality and robustness in the operating system so that its needs is
very targeted on the inset itself okay

<ICE-SIN:S2A-027#26:1:A>
So what are some of the design goals when we started the Windows NT

<ICE-SIN:S2A-027#27:1:A>
We wanted it to be a small true 32-bit multi-tasking operating
system based upon the microkerner uh design okay

<ICE-SIN:S2A-027#28:1:A>
That it has to be portable across Intel and the RISC platform and
it will have to support multiple subsystem such as DOS Win 16 Win 32 POSIX OS
2 right

<ICE-SIN:S2A-027#29:1:A>
And it also has to support the very the merging multiprocessing uh
environment itself

<ICE-SIN:S2A-027#30:1:A>
And finally huge capacities because we're talking about business
and the technical computing environment

<ICE-SIN:S2A-027#31:1:A>
Since we started our we held our first uh Windows NT 32 developers
conference in San Francisco the momentum for Windows NT is just tremendous

<ICE-SIN:S2A-027#32:1:A>
And I just want to take a few moments to go through a couple of
charts to tell you what where are where are the industry support what are
industry talking about it okay

<ICE-SIN:S2A-027#33:1:A>
Uhm we have managed to ship about sixty thousands SD case which are
software development kit uh within seven months from the day we uh had the uh
Windows developer conference in San Francisco

<ICE-SIN:S2A-027#34:1:A>
And we have about four hun four thousand corporate customers
worldwide evaluating Windows NT today and I and that number is going to go up
to twenty thousand with a <unclear> word </unclear> with a much later

<ICE-SIN:S2A-027#35:1:A>
And in fact the book Inside Windows NT and if some of you have
attended uh the lucky three hundred customers who attended my Windows NT
corporate preview in March you might have a copy of this book

<ICE-SIN:S2A-027#36:1:A>
In fact it has been the number two uh in the computer book uh best
selling list

<ICE-SIN:S2A-027#37:1:A>
In fact it outsell the famous book by Madonna itself

<ICE-SIN:S2A-027#38:1:A>
And uh we have just recently completed a survey uhm we did a random
uh sample of the people at that time who have purchased the software
development kit to find out who they are and what they are intending to do
with it cause that that is important to us as well as for our customer itself

<ICE-SIN:S2A-027#39:1:A>
And we find that eighty three per cent of the guys who actually
bought it are developer so that's good news

<ICE-SIN:S2A-027#40:1:A>
And ten per cent of these guys are con consultants and seven per
cent of them are end user

<ICE-SIN:S2A-027#41:1:A>
And when we ask what they were going to do with the developer kit
twenty-one per cent said they were actually going to develop applications for
resell alright

<ICE-SIN:S2A-027#42:1:A>
Twenty-seven said it was for internal use and eighteen per cent for
consulting customers uhm

<ICE-SIN:S2A-027#43:1:A>
Obviously it's going to be a a formable forth in an environment and
consultants have to know how to consul how to implement for their customers
in consultancy area

<ICE-SIN:S2A-027#44:1:A>
And four per cent of that data be for personal use

<ICE-SIN:S2A-027#45:1:A>
But more but more interesting is this chart and I do apologise for
it being very wordy and actually not very clear it's not very sharp

<ICE-SIN:S2A-027#46:1:A>
Uhm about three thousand developer says that they going have us
develop more than nine thousand retail Windows application NT applications
within the next twelve months

<ICE-SIN:S2A-027#47:1:A>
Excuse me

<ICE-SIN:S2A-027#48:1:A>
And that's a lot of application uh on Windows NT to be available as
it roll out uh in in the next couple of months

<ICE-SIN:S2A-027#49:1:A>
And fifty-seven per cent of these developers said they in fact are
developing Windows NT application for mission critical line and business
applications

<ICE-SIN:S2A-027#50:1:A>
This is exactly what we have targeted it for and it's and we are
develop developing mission critical line and bi business application for
Windows NT

<ICE-SIN:S2A-027#51:1:A>
And sixty-nine per cent of the new Windows NT application in fact
is designed in a client server environment

<ICE-SIN:S2A-027#52:1:A>
And twenty-five per cent of developers are actually beginning to
port UNIX MBS and even BMS application uh onto Windows NT itself

<ICE-SIN:S2A-027#53:1:A>
There are a lot of developer too tools available today seventy plus
of them and you see a lot more being available as the product being rolled
out

<ICE-SIN:S2A-027#54:1:A>
But what is really interesting to find is that leading mainframe
tool vendors like computer associate <unclear> word </unclear> knowledge ware
these guys are porting their tools on Windows NT

<ICE-SIN:S2A-027#55:1:A>
And think about if you are a corporate uh or MIS developer you're
so used to using these tools and we have the same tools running on Windows NT

<ICE-SIN:S2A-027#56:1:A>
And that would really facilitate your effort in uh trying to
develop client server application itself

<ICE-SIN:S2A-027#57:1:A>
So who would want Windows NT

<ICE-SIN:S2A-027#58:1:A>
Definitely the Windows Power users

<ICE-SIN:S2A-027#59:1:A>
By that we mean these are the people uhm who who will buy the the
fastest and the greatest in technology

<ICE-SIN:S2A-027#60:1:A>
They will usually be the first adopter and they very often
<unclear> word </unclear> play a role as a Window as a leader in the Windows
community itself

<ICE-SIN:S2A-027#61:1:A>
So we certainly think that the Windows Power user will will be out
there to grab for Windows NT MIS and Business solution builders definitely uh
where their role is past the developing application for their organisation

<ICE-SIN:S2A-027#62:1:A>
Or for their customers Windows NT will definitely provide a very uh
robust environment for which they can deploy solution for customers or for
themselves their own organisation

<ICE-SIN:S2A-027#63:1:A>
Advance business application users these are the guys that is
probably running a claims processing application in insurance industry or it
could be a banking application or an order processing application

<ICE-SIN:S2A-027#64:1:A>
And these guys can actually run all these <unclear> word </unclear>
application of Windows NT given that it's a very secure environment

<ICE-SIN:S2A-027#65:1:A>
Developers definitely our target uhm you've seen with the
anti-clave a lot of developers are in fact developing applications for
Windows NT

<ICE-SIN:S2A-027#66:1:A>
And finally the engineering and uh technical users so wherever they
are a CAD/CAM designer for a automative or a airline uhm industry they
certainly will be able to use Windows NT

<ICE-SIN:S2A-027#67:1:A>
Because there are a lot of the uh leading CAD/CAM software vendors
today are porting their application to Windows NT and one of these examples
is intergraph

<ICE-SIN:S2A-027#68:1:A>
In fact they they gonna port quite a complete suite of their
products to Windows NT itself

<ICE-SIN:S2A-027#69:1:A>
So what is Windows NT

<ICE-SIN:S2A-027#70:1:A>
It has a core set of features okay and uhm one of the first and
foremost one of the most important asset that you will able to uhm uh uh to
to advantage is that the fact that Windows NT is Windows okay

<ICE-SIN:S2A-027#71:1:A>
So whether you're running a Windows application or looks like
Windows and so forth it is Windows it is that user interface that you you've
grown to use uh all this while and grown to love okay

<ICE-SIN:S2A-027#72:1:A>
In addition it will also have provides you with scaleable power
security reliability easy management compatibility with a lot of the variety
of systems that is available today

<ICE-SIN:S2A-027#73:1:A>
And most importantly an open platform for a lot of third party
innovations itself and we'll go into some of these in details uhm uhm in this
couple of charts

<ICE-SIN:S2A-027#74:1:A>
Windows NT is Windows so it won't within some uh common function as
in Windows and that's typically that it is going to be easy to use

<ICE-SIN:S2A-027#75:1:A>
You act you can see Windows NT being demonstrated behind the room

<ICE-SIN:S2A-027#76:1:A>
It is exactly like the Windows interface data workend

<ICE-SIN:S2A-027#77:1:A>
So there is very little uhm uhm time needed in uh learning to use
the system

<ICE-SIN:S2A-027#78:1:A>
All you need to want to be concern with is how do I use my
application cause that's what you want the system do for you not learn a new
operating system that has that require you to learn to to go through a new
and to rethink

<ICE-SIN:S2A-027#79:1:A>
So this a very logical migration for someone who has been used to
Windows environment sit on the Windows NT and start being productive of their
system today

<ICE-SIN:S2A-027#80:1:A>
We certainly have a a a a very uh rich set of applications today
that's already on Windows 3.1 and this set of applications will run on
Windows NT <X>

<ICE-SIN:S2A-027#X81:1:A>
The last three points are really uh fundamental addition to the
Windows platform of products which will begin to see as a consistent
functionality that were prevalent in the whole suite of Windows family of
products that is uh basically the Botian networking so as you buy Windows NT
you could actually be able to do a peer to peer networking with your
colleagues sharing files uh and printers and also email each other okay </X>
