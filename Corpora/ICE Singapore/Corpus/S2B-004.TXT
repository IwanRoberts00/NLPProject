The US says its commitment and military presence in the Pacific will
continue regardless of the outcome of the Philippines bases issue

<ICE-SIN:S2B-004#8:1:A>

that such a presence is viable even without a base like Subic in the
Philipines

<ICE-SIN:S2B-004#9:1:A>
Admiral David Jeremiah said although there are plans to adjust the
composition of US military forces changes in the Pacific will be modest

<ICE-SIN:S2B-004#10:1:A>
Admiral Jeremiah said nations have attacked for too long the idea
that the US presence in the Pacific equates directly and only to the
Philippines

<ICE-SIN:S2B-004#11:1:A>
He pointed out that the US has ship repair facilities in many
places

<ICE-SIN:S2B-004#12:1:A>
There are also several areas where the US can support and sustain
military forces

<ICE-SIN:S2B-004#13:1:A>
Admiral Jeremiah has said the position Singapore took two years ago
in working towards a memorandum of understanding with the US to provide
facilities was a foresighted and thoughtful approach

<ICE-SIN:S2B-004#14:1:A>
This has led the way for other nations to do the same

<ICE-SIN:S2B-004#15:1:A>
He added the US continues to enjoy excellent relations with
Singapore

<ICE-SIN:S2B-004#16:1:A>
It values the cooperation between the two countries as well as
Singapore's open and strong support for a significant American military
presence in the region

<ICE-SIN:S2B-004#17:1:A>
The US is also proud of its role as Singapore's partner in helping
to ensure peace and stability

<ICE-SIN:S2B-004#18:1:A>
Asked if there would be more exercises between the SAF and US
troops Admiral Jeremiah hoped these could be continued and perhaps increased

<ICE-SIN:S2B-004#19:1:A>
He would like to see joint exercises with the involvement of naval
and ground base aviation as well as amphibious and army forces

<ICE-SIN:S2B-004#20:1:A>
He felt it was in these areas that troops can understand how to
work with each other

<ICE-SIN:S2B-004#21:1:A>

of consultations the US holds with its allies in the Asia Pacific region

Malaysia and Singapore is an insurance policy

<ICE-SIN:S2B-004#26:1:A>
On the possibility of expanding the defence arrangement to include
Brunei

<ICE-SIN:S2B-004#27:1:A>
Mr King said it is for Singapore and Malaysia to see how the FPDA
could develop

<ICE-SIN:S2B-004#28:1:A>
He said having a wider security arrangement in the region does not
conflict with the FPDA as an insurance policy

<ICE-SIN:S2B-004#29:1:A>
He said his current visit to the region notwithstanding very
significant developments in other parts of the world is a measure of the
importance Britain attaches to the region

<ICE-SIN:S2B-004#30:1:A>
While there are no imminent danger to countries in the region Mr
King said potential sources of conflict could arise

<ICE-SIN:S2B-004#31:1:A>

possible problem areas
