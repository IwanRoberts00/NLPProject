<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#2:1>
Hi Yeoh,

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#3:1>
It's end of the year again.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#4:1>
Merry Christmas.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#5:1>
Been busy lately ?

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#6:1>
Must be trying to finish up your thesis, isn't it ?

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#7:1>
I sent a birthday card to you and Christine, plus note to Samuel
wondered whether you've received it ( it seemed that I must ask you every
time or else the same thing would happen).

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#8:1>
I've just attended my church camp in Port Dickson ( 4-8 Dec 91).

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#9:1>
It was a good camp.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#10:1>
I felt that our church are more united and there's a desire to be
more involved.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#11:1>
I think it does help to have a full-time pastor.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#12:1>
He and his family came to join our church since Aug 91.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#13:1>
The camp was also an good opportunity for us to know them better and
vice versa.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#14:1>
Most of the time we had programmes, so I didn't had the opportunity
to venture anywhere else.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#15:1>
The only available time to go to the 'Pasar Malam' was on Saturday
afternoon.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#16:1>
On Saturday evening, we had an special night and all the groups had
to come up with an advertisement for the products ( which was previously
assigned to each group).

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#17:1>
Our group came in second.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#18:1>
Guess what, our group name was called B3 Sheep ( Ba Ba Black Sheep) 'coz
our theme for the camp was 'Shepherd, Sheep and Society'.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#19:1>
We even came up with a song sung to the tune of Christmas song about
the 3 Orient king ( can't remember the title of the song).

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#20:1>
I'm still quite busy at work.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#21:1>
Guess there will always be things to do and deadlines to meet.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#22:1>
Today, my boss just asked me to work on producing a booklet to teach
users how to use our online catalogue.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#23:1>
It may sound simple but there's going to quite a lot of things to do
coz I myself have to get myself to be familiar with the system first before I
can try to write anything.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#24:1>
Then I got to get inputs from other people and collate everything
together.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#25:1>
And this is on top of what I have to do in my daily work.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#26:1>
I still got to work on another of a publication on 'Effective
Teaching Methods'.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#27:1>
Actually the bulk of the work for this project was done by my
ex-colleague and I only have to check on the citations and proof-read
everything.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#28:1>
Better stop myself from 'Fa Lao Sao' ( can guess what is this ? ) -
ie letting off my frustrations.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#29:1>
Actually it's not too bad as I still enjoy my work very much.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#30:1>
Did I tell you that I met Chin Hoong in Singapore ?

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#31:1>
( I think it was last month).

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#32:1>
We had lunch at Wisma Atria.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#33:1>
I was on night duty so I could meet her in the afternoon.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#34:1>
She was quite surprised that I cut my hair and it's now quite short
compared to when I was in Australia.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#35:1>
Actually I had this hairstyle since April.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#36:1>
Bet you haven't seen me in my short kinky hairdo.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#37:1>
I had to change hair-dresser because my one could wouldn't want to
cut my hair too short for me.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#38:1>
Somehow he had this impression that I would look better if my hair is
longer.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#39:1>
Do you think that guys generally prefer women to have longer
hairstyles ?

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#40:1>
Then, they would look more feminine.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#41:1>
I haven't got any photographs with my 'new' hairdo, so I can't let
you comment.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#42:1>
So much about myself.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#43:1>
How are you going to spend your Christmas ?

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#44:1>
If you haven't finished your thesis, maybe this should be your target
to finish before Christmas.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#45:1>
Perhaps you would be in a mood to celebrate and enjoy yourself.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#46:1>
Are you plans for next year fixed ?

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#47:1>
I suppose you would be going to Hawaii to present your conference
paper and then, what else ?

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#48:1>
Keep me updated, will you ?

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#49:1>
The last time that I wrote, I was so sleepy and could barely keep
myself awake.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#50:1>
Well, at least today I could manage to write quite a long letter.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#51:1>
It's already 11.30 pm.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#52:1>
Better get to bad fast.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#53:1>
Have really got to stop here.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#54:1>
Bye.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#55:1>
Take care.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#56:1>
Send my regards to Stephanie.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#57:1>
Will you be going to see her in Melbourne ?

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#58:1>
OK, OK Bye ( this time for real!).

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#59:1>

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#60:2>
Dear Suet,

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#61:2>
11/12/91

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#62:2>
Hi, long time no see, no hear.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#63:2>
As I write this note to you, I'm wondering whether we would 'cross'
again just as the last 2 times.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#64:2>
It seemed that we just would write to each other and ended up
crossing each other.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#65:2>
I remembered that I just sent my last letter and one or 2 days later,
I received your letter.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#66:2>
( Now, I don't know where I placed your last letter, hmm, let me see,
got to dig it up among my files of things).

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#67:2>
You can guess how late am I in writing and replying letters to
people.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#68:2>
On the 4th - 8th Dec, we had our church camp.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#69:2>
I guess on the whole, many of us felt ministered to and I personally
felt motivated to pray more for my parents/friends salvation and do something
about it.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#70:2>
You asked in your last letter about whether how I felt about being in
church.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#71:2>
This year.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#72:2>
Well, at first I felt lonely at times as many of my close friends
have left or not in church.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#73:2>
People like Siew Hong ( who got married) and you ( being away), Wei
Tse ( she hasn't been attending any church since early this year.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#74:2>
At first her grandma got a stroke and was hospitalised and then her
aunt got cancer.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#75:2>
Have been trying to encourage her to get back to church, so far not
successful yet.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#76:2>
Do pray for her).

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#77:2>
Others were either too busy or have no time for me.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#78:2>
I was not working until April.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#79:2>
Had a lot of time to laze around but no money to spend.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#80:2>
Can't go out too often.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#81:2>
Later when I started work, was and still is quite busy at work.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#82:2>
Maybe I have been too busy and haven't been making much effort to try
to foster and deepen relationships with other people in church.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#83:2>
Should try hard next year.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#84:2>
15.12.91

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#85:2>
Got started writing this letter again.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#86:2>
It seemed that what I wrote ( above) was quite pathetic, isn't it?

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#87:2>
Well, it isn't so bad.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#88:2>
Of course, there are times when I hot to know some other people
better, like Sharon, Kim Lian, Wendy.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#89:2>
I'm also quite excited about what's happening in church.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#90:2>
I can 'feel' that more are ready to serve and be involved.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#91:2>
There is a sense of unity and concern among the members.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#92:2>
One applications that I would like to do is to make an effort to keep
you both updated about what's happening in church and perhaps try to send you
the church bulletins.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#93:2>
Perhaps, this would better prepare you both for your return to
Singapore.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#94:2>
You're planning to come back in June next year, isn't it?

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#95:2>
My work in the library is getting to be more busy as I take on more
responsibilities but I'm still enjoying what I'm doing.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#96:2>
Right now I'm also trying to learn about a new database management
system call 'Paradox 3' and also trying to compare with 'Quattro Pro' (
spreadsheet system) as I wanted to work on putting some data that I have into
a system which I can retrieve easily.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#97:2>
So I'm staying back after office hours to work on it.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#98:2>
Actually, I'm learning these computer programs out of my own benefit
and is not required by my job.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#99:2>
But I like it.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#100:2>
Maybe I should try to work towards this area of work.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#101:2>
This Christmas, our church is going to have a service during
Christmas day itself as well as carolling ( to visit the shepherd groups).

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#102:2>
There is going to be a Thanksgiving service on New Year's Eve.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#103:2>
Next year, we are also have a prayer meeting ( once every month
where everyone is supposed to attend and is chaired by the pastor).

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#104:2>
So far for the 2 prayer meetings, there are about over 30 people
attending.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#105:2>
It had been very encouraging indeed because in the past two years or
so, it had been very difficult to get people to come for the prayer meetings.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#106:2>
OK time to stop.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#107:2>
Wish you all the best for the coming year and have a blessed
Christmas.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#108:2>
Bye.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#109:2>
Love

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#110:2>
Mee Lan

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#111:2>
P/S I'm sending you the Christmas cantata brochure ( which some of
our church people were involved in) and today's bulletin to you). </I>

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#112:3>
Hi May Lee

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#113:3>
15.12.91

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#114:3>
'Blessed Christmas and New Year'.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#115:3>
Hope I'm not too late.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#116:3>
Been busy trying to rush out Christmas cards and letters which are
long overdue.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#117:3>
How's the weather in Melbourne now?

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#118:3>
Hot and cold and hot again?

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#119:3>
I would think so, that's why I still prefer Sydney!

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#120:3>
Yes, I think I'm still bias and have fond memories of my stay there.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#121:3>
Though I'm now not as keen on migrating there as before.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#122:3>
I think it's because I'm more settled now and the situation in
Australia isn't that good at the moment.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#123:3>
Poor Bob Hawke, this Christmas wouldn't be fun as he faces much
pressure to resign.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#124:3>
Maybe he really should rather than stay on clinging on to his power.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#125:3>
Paul Keating, I bet, would be waiting anxiously to take over the
prime ministership.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#126:3>
The unemployment rate is at its worst in 60 years.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#127:3>
Everyone over there must be quite anxious about the economy and the
political situation.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#128:3>
By the way, I don't think you've told me which university that
you're going to for your Masters course.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#129:3>
Would it be RMIT?

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#130:3>
Then you would have lots of opportunity to meet Bee Ang.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#131:3>
We started to put up the Christmas tree and decorations in office.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#132:3>
Both Dahlia and myself put up the Christmas display and we both
quite like it.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#133:3>
The theme is also related to 'environment-friendliness'.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#134:3>
So we put up a tree with birds flying everywhere ( Dahlia made them
all and they are very nice).

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#135:3>
There's 3-D effect as we put newspapers to make the tree think and
branches have more body and we also cut out different shapes and shades of
leaves to make up the rest of the tree.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#136:3>
rest of the panel were mostly recycled Christmas cards.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#137:3>
( from previous years).

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#138:3>
Quite surprisingly, many people were staring more at the cards than
the tree.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#139:3>
The Christmas decoration along Orchard Road is O.K.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#140:3>
Not very outstanding.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#141:3>
Yesterday I was in Orc.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#142:3>
Rd at about 9:30 pm, it was still very crowded.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#143:3>
I' haven't really done very much of Christmas shopping.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#144:3>
Waiting for the bonus to come.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#145:3>
Oh yes, only 3 more days to go.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#146:3>
Bet everyone in office is waiting for this day.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#147:3>
OK got to stop here.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#148:3>
Bye for now.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#149:3>
Enjoy your first Christmas in Australia and tell us what you did,
won't you?

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#150:3>
Bye.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#151:3>
Love

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#152:3>

Dear Melissa

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#154:4>
16.12.91

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#155:4>
Hi again, Christmas is just around the corner.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#156:4>
What will you be doing.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#157:4>
In fact by the time you received this letter, it might even be over.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#158:4>
I guess you will spend your holidays with your parents.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#159:4>
I don't have much plans for the Christmas period.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#160:4>
Our church will be having a Christmas service on the day itself.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#161:4>
As usual, the youth group in my church is organising carolling but I
don't think I will join them.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#162:4>
I actually had my holidays.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#163:4>
I was in Malaysia in a place called Port Dickson for our annual
church camp ( like the MYC but on a much smaller scale).

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#164:4>
There were about 80 people including over 15 kids of all ages.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#165:4>
We were there from 4th-8th Dec.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#166:4>
Right now, it's my colleagues' turn to have their holidays while I
have to stay in office to manage the ? ? .

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#167:4>
On the 18th ( 2 more days to go), I'll be getting my salary
including my long-awaited bonus.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#168:4>
I had already started planning on what sort of things I would like
to buy or how much to save.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#169:4>
Even though the amount that I received seemed a lot but after
deducting everything, there's nothing much left. <X>

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#X170:4>
At least one thing I can XX myself is that I will be getting my
annual increment on Jan next year.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#X171:4>
As for things in office, most of the work are getting more routine.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#X172:4>
I've also been given special projects to do.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#X173:4>
One of which is to come out with a special publication on how to
use our OPAC system ( called LINC - Library Integrated Network Catalogue).

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#X174:4>
Supposed to be out by June next year.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#X175:4>
But I haven't got very much knowledge in this area.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#X176:4>
In fact I've just borrowed 2 books on OPAC and hope to get myself
more familiar with the systems and the general capabilities of OPAC.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#X177:4>
I've been trying to learn a database management system called
Paradox in office as I wanted to create a database for some information that
I wanted to retrieve easily rather than browsing through many pages.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#X178:4>
However a number of the fields are repeated and I'm wondering
should I be using a spreadsheet instead so that I can copy some of the data
from cell to cell rather than tying them over and over again.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#X179:4>
Actually I've not actually looked into the possibility of whether
Paradox has the ability to copy information from one field to another field
in another record.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#X180:4>
Maybe I should do it before trying out the spreadsheet.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#X181:4>
I was quite excited about learning this new database that I had
been staying back late in office for the last 4 days ( last week).

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#X182:4>
I ended up going home at about 8 pm almost every night.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#X183:4>
In the end I was quite tired considering we always had quite hectic
schedules and having to be at the information counter for half the day.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#X184:4>
Better take care of myself before I fall sick.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#X185:4>
Got to stop here.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#X186:4>
Hey, better drive more carefully now.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#X187:4>
It must be quite scary to be involved in any accident.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#X188:4>
Must be really thankful that no one was hurt.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#X189:4>
Bye.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#X190:4>
Merry Christmas!

<ICE-SIN:W1B-002#X191:4>
