<ICE-SIN:S2A-067#1:1:A>
Much obliged my Lords

<ICE-SIN:S2A-067#2:1:A>
My Lords if I may take this appeal in the manner in which I have
dealt with in my skeletal arguments

<ICE-SIN:S2A-067#3:1:A>
Unless your Lordships have should say otherwise my Lords and I shall
proceed to go through briefly the facts which because of the nature of the
arguments which will be raised subsequently

<ICE-SIN:S2A-067#4:1:A>
They are some of them are material for the purpose of this appeal

<ICE-SIN:S2A-067#5:1:A>
My Lords this appeal arises from a decision of Chan Sek Keong
Judge?? be it on the twenty-sixth day of July nineteen eighty-nine ordering
the petition filed herein by the Appellants in his company's winding up
petition number seventy-seven of nineteen eighty-nine

<ICE-SIN:S2A-067#6:1:A>
On the seventh day of March nineteen eighty-nine he struck out and
the action dismissed on the grounds that the petition and/or the proceedings
instituted by the Appellants thereunder constitute an abuse of the process of
court

<ICE-SIN:S2A-067#7:1:A>
Two the cause of this application herein detects and paid by the
Appellants to the Respondents and the company

<ICE-SIN:S2A-067#8:1:A>
Now in so far as the facts which are material to this appeal are
concerned my Lords my Lords may I be permitted to proceed with paragraph two

<ICE-SIN:S2A-067#9:1:A>
The Appellants are members and minority shareholders of Chong Lee
Leong Seng Company Private Limited herein after referred to as company and on
the seventh of March nineteen eighty-nine instituted proceedings under the
Company's Act Chapter fifty in Company's Winding Up Petition number
seventy-seven of nineteen eighty-nine to seek relieve under section two
hundred and sixteen of the Act against certain of his directors

<ICE-SIN:S2A-067#10:1:A>
On the grounds that the latter A had conducted the affairs of the
company in a manner oppressive to one or more of the members of the company
including the Appellants and/or in this regard of the Appellant's interest as
a member of the company and/or B who are exercising their powers as directors
of the company

<ICE-SIN:S2A-067#11:1:A>
In a manner oppressive to one or more of the members of the company
including the Appellants and/or in disregard of the Appellant's interest as
members of the company and/or C had acted

<ICE-SIN:S2A-067#12:1:A>
And are then or are threatening to act in a manner which unfairly
discriminates against or is otherwise prejudicial to one or more of the
Appellants as members of the company

<ICE-SIN:S2A-067#13:1:A>
The principle relieve served by the Appellants was for the company
to be wound up by the court under the provisions of the Company's Act with
other relieves prayed for

<ICE-SIN:S2A-067#14:1:A>
My Lords pausing here for a moment if I may just refer your
Lordships to the petition itself just to page twenty-seven of the record my
Lords which sets out the relieve sought by the Appellants in their petition
page twenty-seven of the record

<ICE-SIN:S2A-067#15:1:A>
Have your Lordships got that page

<ICE-SIN:S2A-067#16:1:A>
Now your Lordships will note preceding the prayer for relieve there
is a statement my Lord in that paragraph beginning with in the circumstances
and I read my Lord in the circumstances the Petitioners have been advised
that it is just an equitable that the company be wound up

<ICE-SIN:S2A-067#17:1:A>
And then the prayers go on in prayer A one sorry my Lord that Chong
Lee Leong Seng may be wound up by the court under the provisions of the
Company's Act

<ICE-SIN:S2A-067#18:1:A>
So my Lord what I wish to stress at this point in time is that the
relieve sought if I may expand on that my Lord are one a winding up under the
just an equitable rule which is under section two hundred and fifty-four my
Lords of the Company's Act

<ICE-SIN:S2A-067#19:1:A>
Two hundred and fifty-four my Lords if I may refer you

<ICE-SIN:S2A-067#20:1:A>
At page three hundred and forty-eight of the Singapore Statutes
chapter fifty

<ICE-SIN:S2A-067#21:1:A>
Now I would like to draw your Lordship's attention to two
provisions in that section section two hundred and fifty four point

<ICE-SIN:S2A-067#22:1:A>
One reads the court may order the winding up if and then we go on
to F

<ICE-SIN:S2A-067#23:1:A>
The directors have acted in the affairs of the company in their own
interest rather than in the interest of the members as a whole or in any
other manner whatever which appears to be unjust unfair or unjust to other
members

<ICE-SIN:S2A-067#24:1:A>
And under I the court is of the opinion that it is just an
equitable that the company be wound up

<ICE-SIN:S2A-067#25:1:A>
So that my Lords this section two hundred and fifty-four comes
under the division of the Company's Act relating to the winding up by the
court

<ICE-SIN:S2A-067#26:1:A>
And I intend to later develop the argument that in the case of
oppression so to speak my Lords the Petitioner or the oppress minority so to
speak may have availability to wind up under section two hundred and
fifty-four or two hundred and sixteen

<ICE-SIN:S2A-067#27:1:A>
And the nature of my arguments will be that two hundred and sixteen
provides for an additional ground for winding up

<ICE-SIN:S2A-067#28:1:A>
And that has been confirmed my Lords by the learned judge in his
judgment itself

<ICE-SIN:S2A-067#29:1:A>
But suffice it to say my Lords at this point in time it is
pertinent to point out indeed two revealing sections in the Companies Act
relating to winding-up so to speak in respect of acts committed by officers
of the companies and in which relief is being sought by a shareholder
generally called the oppressed shareholder my Lords

<ICE-SIN:S2A-067#30:1:A>
My Lords the petition was presented on the seventeenth of March
nineteen eighty-nine under the provisions of the Companies Winding-Up Rules
nineteen sixty-nine

<ICE-SIN:S2A-067#31:1:A>
And in accordance with Rule twenty-three thereof the Registrar
appointed twenty-first April eight-nine as the date on which the petition was
to be heard

<ICE-SIN:S2A-067#32:1:A>
The petition was thereupon served on the company on the twentieth
of March eighty-nine and the persons named therein as the Respondents that is
the directors of the company

<ICE-SIN:S2A-067#33:1:A>
Now my Lords this date twentieth March is significant because of
the arguments which will later be developed on the question of whether there
was any waiver of the irregularity if any

<ICE-SIN:S2A-067#34:1:A>
Now on the seventh of April nineteen eighty-nine the petition was
advertised as required by Rule twenty-four of the nineteen sixty-nine rules

<ICE-SIN:S2A-067#35:1:A>
On the eighth of April and tenth of April nineteen eighty-nine a
total of four affidavits were filed on behalf of the company in opposition to
the relief sought under the petition

<ICE-SIN:S2A-067#36:1:A>
So after the appearance of the advertisement four affidavits were
filed by the Respondents by the company

<ICE-SIN:S2A-067#37:1:A>
On the tenth of April nineteen eighty-nine the company through
their solicitors applied for and were granted a validation order under the
provisions of section two hundred and fifty-nine of the Companies Act

<ICE-SIN:S2A-067#38:1:A>
That is under the winding-up division inter alia that payments made
by the company and on its behalf including payments out of the company's bank
accounts

<ICE-SIN:S2A-067#39:1:A>
And all other transactions and dispositions of property by and on
behalf of the company and in the ordinary course of business up to

<ICE-SIN:S2A-067#40:1:A>
And including the date on which the petition is disposed of shall
not be avoided by virtue of the provisions of section two hundred and
fifty-nine of the Companies Act

<ICE-SIN:S2A-067#41:1:A>
However before the petition could be heard on the twenty-first of
April nineteen eighty-nine the company on the fourteenth of April that is
after having filed the four affidavits in reply in opposition to the petition
and after having applied for the validation order on the thirteenth of April
then applied for an order under Order eighteen Rule nineteen of the Rules of
the Supreme Court

<ICE-SIN:S2A-067#42:1:A>
And my Lords this is where the second part the record of appeal
which we have tendered in that sets out the summons-in-chambers

<ICE-SIN:S2A-067#43:1:A>
And it would be I think necessary to just look at the
summons-in-chambers and see what precisely was the relief sought by the
Respondents

<ICE-SIN:S2A-067#44:1:A>
This is at Record of Appeal Bundle Two summons-in-chambers

<ICE-SIN:S2A-067#45:1:A>
The Applicants prayed for the following orders

<ICE-SIN:S2A-067#46:1:A>
One that the time for service of this application be reached

<ICE-SIN:S2A-067#47:1:A>
Two that pursuant to Order eighteen Rule nineteen point one and/or
the inherent jurisdiction of this honourable court the petition herein is
struck off and the action be dismissed on the grounds that the petition
and/or the proceedings instituted by the Petitioners there under constitute
an abuse of the process of court

<ICE-SIN:S2A-067#48:1:A>
If I may just digress for a moment my Lords what they are saying is
because the Petitioners had instituted the proceedings in the way they did
that act of commencement under the winding-up rules constituted an abuse of
the process of court and it was on that ground and no other that the
summons-in-chambers to strike out was filed and upon which the order was
subsequently made by the learned judge

<ICE-SIN:S2A-067#49:1:A>
Three that pursuant to his inherent jurisdiction this honourable
court may make such orders as it deems fit for the purpose of remedying the
consequences of the said abuse

<ICE-SIN:S2A-067#50:1:A>
Again my Lords the whole tenor of the application was abuse of the
process of court

<ICE-SIN:S2A-067#51:1:A>
And of course Prayer four that summons my Lords is a question the
prayer for costs which we need not deal with

<ICE-SIN:S2A-067#52:1:A>
My Lords as we understand it if I may resume with paragraph eight
of my skeletal arguments the main ground for the allegation of abuse of
process is that proceedings for any relief from oppression must be commenced
under Order eighty-eight of the R S C and not under the winding-up rules

<ICE-SIN:S2A-067#53:1:A>
And therefore ought to be struck off under Order eighteen Rule
nineteen or under Order ninety-two Rule four of the R S C

<ICE-SIN:S2A-067#54:1:A>
That is basically the main attack my Lords of the procedure adopted
by the Appellants that it must be commenced under Order eighty-eight

<ICE-SIN:S2A-067#55:1:A>
The application was heard by Chan Sek Keong Justice in chambers on
the twenty-first of April eighty-nine

<ICE-SIN:S2A-067#56:1:A>
That was day on which it was assigned by the Registrar my Lords to
hear the petition itself

<ICE-SIN:S2A-067#57:1:A>
And by way of a reserved judgment dated twenty-sixth July nineteen
eighty-nine Chan Sek Keong Justice ordered the petition to be struck out on
the ground that it was improperly presented as a winding-up petition under
the Companies Winding-Up Rules sixty-nine since he was of the view that the
proceedings ought to have been properly commenced by way of a petition
pursuant to the provisions of Order eighty-eight of the Rules of the Supreme
Court nineteen seventy

<ICE-SIN:S2A-067#58:1:A>
And if I may just at this point of time conveniently refer to Order
eighty-eight my Lords

<ICE-SIN:S2A-067#59:1:A>
It's at page two hundred and ninety-five of the R S C and that
order is entitled the Companies Act nineteen sixty-seven which is our present
Chapter fifty my Lords

<ICE-SIN:S2A-067#60:1:A>
Now if your Lordships were to look at Rule five the following page

<ICE-SIN:S2A-067#61:1:A>
The following applications under the Act must be made by petition
and this rule my Lords prescribe the mode of commencement of the various
actions under the Companies Act namely applications and we are only concerned
with H my Lords

<ICE-SIN:S2A-067#62:1:A>
Under section one hundred and eighty-one of the Act for relief in
cases of oppression

<ICE-SIN:S2A-067#63:1:A>
The section one hundred and eighty-one mentioned therein is now
section two hundred and sixteen of our revised statutes my Lords of the
Companies Act

<ICE-SIN:S2A-067#64:1:A>
So my Lords what Rule five of Order eighty-eight prescribes is the
mode of commencement and if I may just this may be basic

<ICE-SIN:S2A-067#65:1:A>
But I think it's needed to stress at this point in time my Lords
that there are only four modes of commencing proceedings in the High Court in
Singapore namely the writ of summons originating summons petition and
originating motion

<ICE-SIN:S2A-067#66:1:A>
Only four modes in which to commence originating process in the
High Court

<ICE-SIN:S2A-067#67:1:A>
And Rule five prescribes that an action for relief under section
one hundred and eighty-six must be commenced by petition

<ICE-SIN:S2A-067#68:1:A>
So that my Lords if for instance an oppressed shareholder decides
to commence by way of a writ of summons then of course he would have used the
wrong mode for commencement and that mode would be totally one which is
contrary to Order eighty-eight Rule five H <X>

<ICE-SIN:S2A-067#X69:1:A>
And it is necessary my Lords to stress at this point of time this
argument because as I develop my arguments further my Lords what the
Respondents did in this case was also to commence the action by way of a
petition under the winding-up rules So the mode of commencement is important
What Order eighty-eight prescribes is the mode of commencement </X> </I>
