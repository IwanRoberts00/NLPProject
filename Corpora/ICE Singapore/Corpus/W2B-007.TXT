<h> The Family Man </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-007#2:1>
I loved to hear my father recount how he met my mother.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-007#3:1>
It was one of the rare times that my mother would really blush!

<ICE-SIN:W2B-007#4:1>
They were introduced to each other by N I Low and his wife.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-007#5:1>
The Lows, being Foochow, easily won the confidence of my mother, who
came from the Foochow settlement of Sibu in Sarawak.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-007#6:1>
Ethel, the Low's vivacious daughter, studied the violin with my
father.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-007#7:1>
She was a very talented student and my father taught her at the Low
residence in Lowland Road.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-007#8:1>
My father first met my mother when he went to give Ethel a lesson.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-007#9:1>
He was struck by her beauty, but felt thwarted by her seeming
reticence in conversation.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-007#10:1>
He mentioned to the Lows that it was so difficult to communicate with
Miss Chang as she would speak in monosyllables.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-007#11:1>
The fact was, as my mother would butt in at this point in the story,
that she was awed by this handsome young man with such thick wavy hair and
who spoke with an enticing foreign accent.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-007#12:1>
I suppose she meant his Dutch-tinted English.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-007#13:1>
My mother was also very conscious of her command of English.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-007#14:1>
She had come from Sibu ( Sarawak) to study at the Methodist Girls'
School in Singapore.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-007#15:1>
She knew very little English then, having been educated in a Chinese
school at home.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-007#16:1>
When she met my father, however, she was already teaching English in
Chong Hock, a Chinese school in Chinatown.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-007#17:1>
It was her reserved nature that prevented her from expressing herself
fully.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-007#18:1>
Apparently, in spite of her reticence, my mother had many suitors.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-007#19:1>
Though my father was encouraged by the Lows, he was rather hesitant
about pressing his suit.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-007#20:1>
When he finally plucked up the courage to propose to her, he had to
confess that he had only five dollars to his name.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-007#21:1>
My mother must have been a very " liberated" woman, for she knew that
she was earning more than he, and had a stable job as compared to his
unpredictable one.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-007#22:1>
They were married in St Paul's Church in Serangoon Road on 3 August
1943 and at the wedding reception, Ethel provided the music.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-007#23:1>
A year later, Sylvia, their first daughter was born.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-007#24:1>
Hardly a few months old, she was transported to Sumatra where the new
family waited out the war years.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-007#25:1>
On their return to Singapore in 1947, my father settled down to the
life of a music teacher.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-007#26:1>
Or so my mother thought.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-007#27:1>
She had no idea that he had other aspirations.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-007#28:1>
Perhaps he did not either.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-007#29:1>
It was his ingenuity, tremendous energy and enthusiasm, coupled with
a flair for interpersonal communication that propelled him from one project
to another.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-007#30:1>
My father rented, and later bought the property at 22 Balmoral
Crescent which he named " La Chanterelle", the name for the E string on the
violin, because of the singing quality of the string.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-007#31:1>
One of the three spacious bedrooms was converted into a studio.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-007#32:1>
The verandah was conveniently used later on for orchestra rehearsals.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-007#33:1>
In one of the back rooms of the house, he set up a work bench for
violin repairs and bow rehairing - activities which took up many of his
Sundays in the early years.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-007#34:1>
Sunday was also the day to clean the fish tanks and to bathe the
dogs.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-007#35:1>
He deticked them and even extracted maggots from their wounds ( for
they used to get into fierce fights with stray dogs).

<ICE-SIN:W2B-007#36:1>
At any one time, there were 3 or 4 dogs in the house, all mongrels.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-007#37:1>
I enjoyed it most was when there was a new litter of pups; they were
so adorable.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-007#38:1>
Later, my father acquired a couple of German Shepherds.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-007#39:1>
These seemed to give more trouble than the mongrels.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-007#40:1>
Nevertheless, my father gave them a work-out every morning before
breakfast and every evening before dinner.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-007#41:1>
My father's other past time was rearing gold fish.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-007#42:1>
It was here that I learnt how fish spawned and even how tadpoles
became frogs, for we had some frogs living in a shallow well.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-007#43:1>
On wet days we had a frog chorus of high calibre!

<ICE-SIN:W2B-007#44:1>
One of the daily duties in fish rearing is to feed them.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-007#45:1>
From time to time, on Friday evening after work, we went to the fish
shop to buy a mass of worms for the fishes' gourmet meal.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-007#46:1>
if my father had no time to go, the fish had to make do with oats.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-007#47:1>
On Sunday afternoons, after our " siesta" we invariably went to visit
my father's third brother who lived in Wilkinson Road.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-007#48:1>
My Uncle's compound was always filled with cars, for he was a first
class mechanic and a successful car dealer.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-007#49:1>
Sometimes he sent his cars to our place for " storage".

<ICE-SIN:W2B-007#50:1>
My uncle sold my mother a Morris Minor which she kept for 15 years.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-007#51:1>
Although every Chinese New Year my Uncle asked her, " Mahu tukar?" (
Do you want to change your car?) my mother didn't pay any attention until the
day the front axle snapped and left her stranded in the middle of the road!

<ICE-SIN:W2B-007#52:1>
On other Sundays, we would go to the 4 o'clock show at Cathay,
Capitol or Odeon.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-007#53:1>
A stroll in the Botanic Gardens or the MacRitchie Reservoir with our
black German Shepherd was also a treat.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-007#54:1>
This was followed by a visit to Koek Road to buy a packet of Char
Kway Teow, satay or poh piah.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-007#55:1>
Other times when Daddy actually spent time with us was at our evening
badminton sessions or when we slept in the air-conditioned studio on hot
nights.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-007#56:1>
We would drag our matresses into the room and camp there.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-007#57:1>
He would play us his favourite records or show us his book on gold
fishes.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-007#58:1>
he regaled us with stories about composers.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-007#59:1>
I particularly liked the book on " Papa" Haydn, and how Dad told us
the story of the " Surprise" Symphony.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-007#60:1>
Dad would sing the opening bars of the Symphony to us.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-007#61:1>
it consists of a soft passage in the strings.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-007#62:1>
Then suddenly, would come a loud chord ( the " surprise") and
frighten all of us.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-007#63:1>
it was fun to wait for the big bang!

<ICE-SIN:W2B-007#64:1>
The advent of black and white television in 1963 brought a total
change in the after dinner schedule.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-007#65:1>
I remember the first week of transmission when we were glued to the
box, be they Chinese, Malay or Indian programme.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-007#66:1>
We watched it all from the first " Vanakam" to the last " Goodnight".

<ICE-SIN:W2B-007#67:1>
My father loved watching TV.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-007#68:1>
I suppose it was good relaxation.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-007#69:1>
Bonanza and Hawaii Five-O were two of his favourites.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-007#70:1>
He would never miss any of the Mantovani Programs.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-007#71:1>
Boxing and wrestling were his preferred sports - from the armchair,
that is.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-007#72:1>
Conversations at dinner time were fun and so were those languid
evenings spent lounging on the cushioned can furniture on the verandah.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-007#73:1>
In later years, when Dad became more involved in his impresario work
and when we had to tackle our homework, these lazy nights on the verandah
became few and far between.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-007#74:1>
My father was a very sociable person and had a group of friends with
whom he played tennis and went to parties.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-007#75:1>
It was fun for us kids to peer out from the studio at the grown-ups
enjoying themselves dancing on the verandah at our balmoral Crescent house.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-007#76:1>
The old dance records would be spinning on the turntable of the
gramophone and we giggled at the contortions of the tango and the wiggles of
the samba and the fox-trot.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-007#77:1>
Dad claims he was a suave dancer.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-007#78:1>
My mother, on the other hand, was never comfortable in this milieu.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-007#79:1>
In later years, as an impresario, my father came into contact with
many people in the foreign missions.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-007#80:1>
He would rush off to cocktails at the end of the day.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-007#81:1>
I thought my parents looked a handsome pair - he in his dark suit and
she in her Thai silk cheongsam and pearls.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-007#82:1>
My parents often entertained at home when my father's artists came to
town.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-007#83:1>
We children were banished to the bedroom where a curtain separated us
from the adult chatter in the dining room.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-007#84:1>
The old adage that cobblers' children are worst shod did not apply in
our family.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-007#85:1>
The fact that my father succeeded in making all his children
musicians was due to his perseverance.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-007#86:1>
However, each child was introduced differently to formal music
lessons and each one responded differently.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-007#87:1>
I fear my sister Sylvia was the guinea pig!

<ICE-SIN:W2B-007#88:1>
As she was the first child, my father was keen to give her the head
start that he would have wanted for himself.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-007#89:1>
He recounted many times to over-zealous parents that " ...as soon as
I put a violin under her chin, she started to cry.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-007#90:1>
My heart dropped!".

<ICE-SIN:W2B-007#91:1>
Sylvia could not be persuaded to continue.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-007#92:1>
However, my father did not give up.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-007#93:1>
When she was twelve, he introduced her to the cello.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-007#94:1>
In two years, she appeared as soloist with his orchestra.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-007#95:1>
My father must have been proud of her.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-007#96:1>
Sylvia's reminiscences, however, are entirely different, " Our
relationship was coloured a lot by what happened during my childhood.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-007#97:1>
As a kid, I was not really motivated to learn music.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-007#98:1>
But here was a father who was very interested in music and was
hopeful that his children would develop the same fervour.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-007#99:1>
So there was a lot of friction around".

<ICE-SIN:W2B-007#100:1>
Sylvia, now the mother of one of Goh Soon Tioe's grandsons,
reflects, " In those days you didn't think psychologically about being
parents.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-007#101:1>
You never analysed how you were going to bring up your children, so
parents as well as children muddled along by trial and error.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-007#102:1>
Perhaps Dad thought that by giving us a headstart in music he was
really doing us a favour.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-007#103:1>
He didn't consider the child's interest, aptitude or desires.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-007#104:1>
Also, once I got on the treadmill of music lessons, I was expected
to practise on my own and sustain my own non-existent interest!

<ICE-SIN:W2B-007#105:1>
I don't remember any words of encouragement or inquiries except, "
Have you practised?".

<ICE-SIN:W2B-007#106:1>
" In addition, I really hated the fact that I always had to perform
in front of those artists he sponsored.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-007#107:1>
Since I was always not really prepared, it was a terrifying and
sometimes humiliating experience.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-007#108:1>
When I was awarded a scholarship to study at the Peabody Institute
in the U.S., I was rather apprehensive.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-007#109:1>
I neither had a passion for music nor was I that well prepared.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-007#110:1>
Dad surprised me by being sympathetic to these feelings.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-007#111:1>
He advised me to give it a try.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-007#112:1>
If I did not like it, I could always change my mind."

<ICE-SIN:W2B-007#113:1>
My father, however, believed that he was giving us the kind of
support that he himself had longed to receive.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-007#114:1>
In one of his letters to me, he remarked, " It is strange to think
how a father's ambition could be passed over to his children...

<ICE-SIN:W2B-007#115:1>
I wanted very much to be a concert violinist...

<ICE-SIN:W2B-007#116:1>
I did not achieve this ambition of my life...

<ICE-SIN:W2B-007#117:1>
Then came my dream that my children should inherit my talents and I
could develop them and give them the best opportunity possible...

<ICE-SIN:W2B-007#118:1>
Now I see this ambition coming to fulfillment in your achievements
and that of Achi's ( Sylvia's)".

<ICE-SIN:W2B-007#119:1>
During most of my early years it didn't look as if I was going to be
much of a musician either.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-007#120:1>
I was always slightly afraid of Dad.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-007#121:1>
He was always chasing me to practise, while I much preferred to laze
on my bed after school devouring Enid Blyton books.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-007#122:1>
Although I didn't cry when the violin was put under my chin, I let
the instrument lie untouched most of the time under my bed.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-007#123:1>
Lessons would be irregular and they would occur either before or
after dinner.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-007#124:1>
In my opinion, this is the worst time of day for both teacher and
student!

<ICE-SIN:W2B-007#125:1>
Most lessons would end in impatient shouts from my father and tears
on my part.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-007#126:1>
It was not till I was twelve that my father realised that, if I were
to be a violist, he would have to include me in his regular teaching
schedule. <X>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-007#X127:1>
From then, I had two lessons every week till I left for the U.S.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-007#X128:1>
There were very few lessons which ended in tears then, for he
recognised my seriousness and became very encouraging and proud of my
achievements.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-007#X129:1>
This gave me a lot of confidence. </X> </I>
