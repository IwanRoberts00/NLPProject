<h> STORY TELLING </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2D-020#5:1>
<h> 8) Tell Me A Story </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2D-020#6:1>
There is so much that can be got out of story-telling.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-020#7:1>
It is not just to entertain the child but also to feed him with
information of his cultural background, to teach him moral values and to
enhance family cohesiveness.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-020#8:1>
There are different types of stories and different ways of presenting
them.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-020#9:1>
To simplify things, stories could be categorized into family stories
and classical stories.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-020#10:1>
<h> Family Stories </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2D-020#11:1>
These stories give the child an idea of himself and the family he
belongs to.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-020#12:1>
<h> The child himself </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2D-020#13:1>
As always, begin with the most familiar, which is, the child and his
surroundings.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-020#14:1>
Tell your child stories about himself as soon as he is old enough to
understand.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-020#15:1>
You can even start with the labour room scenario - tell him his
weight at birth and how he looked when he was born.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-020#16:1>
Tell him how you felt about that tiny " squealing bundle", and how
Dad was not sure how to carry him.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-020#17:1>
He looked so small and fragile then.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-020#18:1>
Show him photographs of himself at that stage, if you have any, and
some of the presents he was given and who gave them to him.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-020#19:1>
If he is able to understand, tell him the symbolism of some gifts.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-020#20:1>
The little blankets and tiny gold anklets and bracelets from his
grandparents will fascinate him.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-020#21:1>
" Was I that tiny?" he would ask.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-020#22:1>
One question will lead to the next and before you realize it, you
will have used up one side of a tape on the story of his birth.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-020#23:1>
If your child is old enough, you can even tell him of the customs
your family observes on the birth of a child.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-020#24:1>
The milestones of a child's development can be made into stories for
him.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-020#25:1>
Tell him of the time when he started teething.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-020#26:1>
Include the date and his exact age, if you can remember.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-020#27:1>
He could be irritable and bit at everything, including his elder
sister.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-020#28:1>
Let him know how his parents helped him through that difficult period
- the teething biscuits and toys you bought for him to chew on.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-020#29:1>
Show him his teething toys ( if you still have them) with his teeth
marks.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-020#30:1>
His next milestones are when he started to crawl, stand and walk.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-020#31:1>
Tell him what you had to do to accommodate his new skills.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-020#32:1>
This would include removing things out of his reach and helping him
to cushion his falls.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-020#33:1>
Let him know how he insisted on not being held when walking, even
though he was not steady on his feet, and how he wanted his independence, and
suffered many falls for it.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-020#34:1>
Let him know how determined he was, and how he learnt very quickly to
break his falls.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-020#35:1>
He could be climbing chairs too.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-020#36:1>
Tell him of the accidents if there were any, and how you had to buy
him very heavy chairs that would not topple as he climbed on them, and how he
loved climbing stairs as well, that you had to line the steps with very thick
carpet and install child-safe doors at both ends of the stairs.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-020#37:1>
Tell him about the time when he started talking and how he tried
pronouncing his name and other family members'.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-020#38:1>
We still tease our daughter about her " Que me, que me" when she
tried to say " Excuse me".

<ICE-SIN:W2D-020#39:1>
You might have some recordings of his early utterances.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-020#40:1>
Perhaps you could prompt him to talk or sing, to show him how he has
improved.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-020#41:1>
Besides the milestones of his development, talk about incidents that
punctuated his life: measles, his first encounter with a particular food,
like durian, or with an animal he had not seen, or his first ride on a Ferris
wheel or a kiddy machine or even the lift.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-020#42:1>
There are so many firsts in his life that you can talk to him about.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-020#43:1>
You can practically turn everything that happened into stories for
him.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-020#44:1>
<h> Parents </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2D-020#45:1>
Delve as far as possible into your childhood for incidents of
interest to him.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-020#46:1>
A younger child would like to compare situations between himself and
his parents.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-020#47:1>
" When did Mummy start to walk?

<ICE-SIN:W2D-020#48:1>
Was it at the same age as I?" are some of the usual questions.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-020#49:1>
It thrills him to see photographs of you as a child, your old toys,
clothes and the things you used.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-020#50:1>
My daughter who can sprint, loves to compare herself with her father
who was an athlete during his younger days.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-020#51:1>
In such a situation, there is so much material to build stories on.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-020#52:1>
There are trophies, photographs and old school magazines to prompt
Dad on to yet another story of " When I was".

<ICE-SIN:W2D-020#53:1>
I could see how her eyes would glow with pride for a father who could
do so much.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-020#54:1>
<h> School </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2D-020#55:1>
There is so much of your school life that you would like to tell your
child.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-020#56:1>
This includes the talentime, camps, school concerts and trips that
you participated in.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-020#57:1>
Telling him about each occasion brings to mind the friends and
teachers involved.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-020#58:1>
This will inevitably take you to the description of the place where
it all happened.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-020#59:1>
Photographs help with the narration.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-020#60:1>
Reference to former classmates who are familiar to him helps too.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-020#61:1>
Again, be careful about the scrapes you got yourself into unless you
do not mind your child doing the same.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-020#62:1>
<h> Home </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2D-020#63:1>
Memories of your own childhood days would not be too difficult to
recall.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-020#64:1>
They make interesting stories especially when they were spent in an
environment that is entirely different from what your child is experiencing
now.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-020#65:1>
The difficulty lies in where to begin and who to begin with.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-020#66:1>
It is easier to use yourself as the main subject, and then find an
occasion to work out a story.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-020#67:1>
Then other people around you will just fall into place.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-020#68:1>
Take an example:

<ICE-SIN:W2D-020#69:1>
When Mummy was six years old, she had a fall and knocked her big toe
nail out.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-020#70:1>
( Question: Did it hurt?) Yes, it did.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-020#71:1>
I was very much a tomboy and loved running around with the
neighbourhood children.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-020#72:1>
They were all older than I and were boys.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-020#73:1>
I tried to do everything they did.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-020#74:1>
Young girls did not usually have the freedom I had.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-020#75:1>
It was just that I was Grandma's first grandchild and I was allowed
to do many things.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-020#76:1>
( There were lots of questions here about why I was allowed so much
freedom and what else I did).

<ICE-SIN:W2D-020#77:1>
One day the children decided to do something very naughty.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-020#78:1>
There was a wide monsoon drain in front of Grandpa's house.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-020#79:1>
They challenged each other to cross it by balancing on the small
water-pipe which ran across it.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-020#80:1>
They went first.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-020#81:1>
All of them crossed it safely.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-020#82:1>
Then it was my turn.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-020#83:1>
I was scared.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-020#84:1>
I did not like the look of the water rushing below in the drain.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-020#85:1>
But I did not want to be called a coward.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-020#86:1>
So I took my steps, balancing on the same pipe.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-020#87:1>
When I was half-way through, Grandma came.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-020#88:1>
I tried to hurry across and fell...not into the drain, but on the
opposite side of it.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-020#89:1>
The big toe bled.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-020#90:1>
I screamed.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-020#91:1>
That was the best way to avoid being disciplined.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-020#92:1>
However, I did hurt myself.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-020#93:1>
I found my big toe nail loose, hanging on only by a bit of the toe
skin.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-020#94:1>
<h> Classics </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2D-020#95:1>
As family stories increase a child's awareness of himself, classical
stories and folklore prepare him for an understanding of his own culture.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-020#96:1>
Besides, the child is bound to encounter reference to figures and
situations from classical stories later on.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-020#97:1>
<h> Folklore and mythology </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2D-020#98:1>
Just as a Christian child grows up with Bible stories, a Hindu child
is equipped with those from the Ramayana and of the different deities of the
Hindu mythology.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-020#99:1>
The same goes for Muslim child, and a child from a Buddhist-Taoist
family.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-020#100:1>
Beside these, there are moral stories as well as tales of romance
and heroism in each culture.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-020#101:1>
There is also folklore particular to the region where the family
comes from.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-020#102:1>
Thus there is so much each individual has from his heritage.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-020#103:1>
In our multi-cultural society, influenced by western education and
media, there is a grave danger of an individual losing his cultural roots.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-020#104:1>
A child needs to be taught his heritage early, or it would be
difficult to force it upon him when the influence of other cultures sets in.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-020#105:1>
One effective way is by telling him stories.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-020#106:1>
A busy parent who feels that she does not have enough time for her
child can stretch her time by telling stories onto cassette tapes.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-020#107:1>
She can pitch the stories at the level her child can understand, and
personalize them with the child's responses and queries, and her reference to
him.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-020#108:1>
<h> Classics in English </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2D-020#109:1>
1) What to tell - Though it is best to teach one's own heritage, in
one's own mother tongue, there are some of us who are not properly schooled
in it to be sufficiently proficient.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-020#110:1>
There is a whole wide range of classics in the English language that
will never grow old.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-020#111:1>
To name a few: · Children's classics, like The Ugly Duckling,
Cinderella, Snow White, and Jack and the Bean Stalk.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-020#112:1>
Aesop's Fables, like The Dog and His Reflection.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-020#113:1>
Bible stories.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-020#114:1>
Translations of stories from Chinese, Indian, Malay, Greek, and
Roman mythologies.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-020#115:1>
Simplified tales from Shakespeare.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-020#116:1>
The mythologies which may appear rather formidable can be
simplified.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-020#117:1>
The child may be about five years old when you tell him these
stories.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-020#118:1>
It does not matter if many details need to be left out.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-020#119:1>
The purpose is to give him the main story line with emphases only on
parts of the stories that interest him.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-020#120:1>
It would be enough for him just to know who Cinderella, Hang Tuah,
Sita, the Monkey God, or Helen of Troy is.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-020#121:1>
As these stories are classics, he will hear or read about them again
and again, each time learning more.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-020#122:1>
The purpose of recommending classics over other stories is to
prepare him for the original versions and for understanding references made
to them, both in literature and in common day-to-day situations, like: · I
can't afford it, I need a fairy godmother to help me out.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-020#123:1>
I cannot wear the shoes, I don't have Cinderella's feet.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-020#124:1>
She thinks she's Helen of Troy.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-020#125:1>
He has the wisdom of Pao Kung.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-020#126:1>
You need Samson to lift this.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-020#127:1>
Thus with some basic knowledge of the classics, the child's level of
comprehension is increased as he listens to adult speech, and when he starts
to read by himself.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-020#128:1>
Of course, this does not mean leaving out popular characters from
Mother Goose, Disneyland and Sesame Street.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-020#129:1>
There are so many picture story books about these characters.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-020#130:1>
The fact that they have been around for so long makes them classics
too.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-020#131:1>
However, these are more suitable for the child when he is younger,
say, two or three years old.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-020#132:1>
Some children grow out of them sooner than others.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-020#133:1>
But use them for as long as the child wants them, together with the
fairy tales.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-020#134:1>
2) How to tell - For a child less than two years old, you could use
a picture book to tell the story.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-020#135:1>
Of course, the choice of subject must be of interest to him, and the
language level an l the speed of narration must suit him.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-020#136:1>
For a two-year-old, you would not read the text in the book, but
tell the story from the pictures, changing your tone of voice to match the
character and using sound effects for excitement.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-020#137:1>
You could prompt the child to help you.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-020#138:1>
Take for example, in the Three Little Pigs, the wolf would have a
gruff voice, the little pigs, cute voices and the mother pig a sweet voice.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-020#139:1>
When the wolf knocks on the door of a little pig, you could knock on
the table to produce the sound and prompt your child to help you. <X>

<ICE-SIN:W2D-020#X140:1>
When you tell about the wolf blowing the house down, you could blow
into the microphone, and prompt him to do the same.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-020#X141:1>
The story would then not be a monotonous drone, but a lively
presentation with the child's participation.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-020#X142:1>
When the child is ready to be introduced to print, read the story
to him, pointing to each word as you go along.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-020#X143:1>
The book might have been used many times before, and the story is,
therefore, familiar to him.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-020#X144:1>
But it is easier for him to match spoken words with the written
words then.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-020#X145:1>
Reading skills are picked up this way. </X> </I>
