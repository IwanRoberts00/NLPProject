<ICE-SIN:S2A-062#1:1:A>
Your Honour the findings the appeal that's before your Honour
here is essentially an appeal on the finding of fact made by the learned
trial judge after hearing witnesses

<ICE-SIN:S2A-062#2:1:A>
Your Honour I wish to take your Honour very quickly to the
principles on which an appellate court acts in reviewing a finding of fact
and your Honour these cases are referred to in my skeletal arguments

<ICE-SIN:S2A-062#3:1:A>
The first I would refer your Honour to is a case of Colonial
Securities Trust Company Limited versus Massey and Others

<ICE-SIN:S2A-062#4:1:A>
That appears your Honour at my bundle of authorities filed in
respect of Civil Appeal Number one hundred and sixteen of eighty-seven that's
the first case at page one

<ICE-SIN:S2A-062#5:1:A>
I refer your Honour to the headnotes

<ICE-SIN:S2A-062#6:1:A>
It says that where a case tried by a judge without a jury comes
before the court of appeal that court will presume that the decision of the
judge on the facts was right and will not disturb it unless the Appellant
satisfactorily makes out that it was wrong

<ICE-SIN:S2A-062#7:1:A>
Your Honour in this very short headnote your Honour there is your
Honour will notice a presumption that the decision of a judge on a finding of
facts was correct and secondly your Honour that there is always this onus
thrust upon the Appellant to show that he was wrong

<ICE-SIN:S2A-062#8:1:A>
Your Honour having said that I refer your Honour to the second case
and that's at page two of my skeletal arguments

<ICE-SIN:S2A-062#9:1:A>
It's found at page five of the bundle of authorities

<ICE-SIN:S2A-062#10:1:A>
That's the decision of Montgomery and Company Limited versus
Wallace James

<ICE-SIN:S2A-062#11:1:A>
Your Honour the facts basically in the Montgomery case was an
action by the plaintiff respondent in which she raised an action for
interdict

<ICE-SIN:S2A-062#12:1:A>
I believe that is the action more or less akin to an action for an
injunction against the defendant appellants and other persons encroaching on
a strip of ground consisting of a few yards in length and breadth situated on
a edge of the river on

<ICE-SIN:S2A-062#13:1:A>
The plea that this ground in question had from time immemorial been
dedicated to the use of herself and the inhabitants for the purpose of
recreation and amusement and the bleaching and dry of clothes

<ICE-SIN:S2A-062#14:1:A>
So it essentially your Honour was the issue in question was whether
there was this user and whether it was established

<ICE-SIN:S2A-062#15:1:A>
If it was she would have succeeded

<ICE-SIN:S2A-062#16:1:A>
Your Honour the House of Lords in this case held and found as a
fact that this ground had from time immemorial been and had not been
dedicated for the use as here described

<ICE-SIN:S2A-062#17:1:A>
Your Honour I would refer to the decision of the Earl of Halsbury
at page seven in which he sets out the principles which will be relevant in
my submissions in this case

<ICE-SIN:S2A-062#18:1:A>
At page seven the Earl of Halsbury L C said this my Lord

<ICE-SIN:S2A-062#19:1:A>
I think this appeal should be allowed

<ICE-SIN:S2A-062#20:1:A>
It is simply a question of fact and doubtless where a question of
fact has been decided by a tribunal which has seen and heard the witnesses
the greatest weight ought to be attached to the finding of such a tribunal

<ICE-SIN:S2A-062#21:1:A>
It has had the opportunity of observing the demeanor of the
witnesses and judging of their veracity and accuracy in a way that no
appellate court can have

<ICE-SIN:S2A-062#22:1:A>
But where no question arises as to truthfulness and where the
question is as to the proper inferences to be drawn from truthful evidence
then the original tribunal is in no better position to decide than the judges
of an appellate court

<ICE-SIN:S2A-062#23:1:A>
Your Honour stopping here the emphasis your Honour I would draw is
the distinction between truthfulness truthful evidence your Honour and in
this case though as I have said it is simply a question of fact

<ICE-SIN:S2A-062#24:1:A>
I do not think it is necessary to discredit a single witness in the
sense of imputing to him willful untruth

<ICE-SIN:S2A-062#25:1:A>
There are some differences between the two sets of witnesses though
I think not very much on any questions which depends on the personal
recollection of the witnesses

<ICE-SIN:S2A-062#26:1:A>
And three lines down your Honour he says but I give credit to the
honest desire of all the witnesses to give an accurate view of the fitting??
as they themselves saw it

<ICE-SIN:S2A-062#27:1:A>
So your Honour the House of Lords in that case drew a distinction
in an appeal

<ICE-SIN:S2A-062#28:1:A>
An appellate court is in as good a position as the trial judge if
there is no question of untruthful evidence where truth has been established

<ICE-SIN:S2A-062#29:1:A>
And rightly so in the facts of the Montgomery case because we have
in that case two different sets of witnesses both trying to tell the court
what they saw over a long period of time

<ICE-SIN:S2A-062#30:1:A>
There was no question of any untruthfulness they were merely
relating to the court what were their personal experiences what they saw over
a period of time

<ICE-SIN:S2A-062#31:1:A>
Unlike your Honour in this case where both the Appellant and the
Respondent were in control of their vehicles

<ICE-SIN:S2A-062#32:1:A>
It was the case it was either you or I who was responsible for the
accident

<ICE-SIN:S2A-062#33:1:A>
And your Honour it's my respectful submission your Honour that
there is a distinction truthful evidence is in issue in this case

<ICE-SIN:S2A-062#34:1:A>
Your Honour if I may again refer your Honour to the next case and
that is the case of Powell and Wife versus Treakin Menon Nursing??

<ICE-SIN:S2A-062#35:1:A>
Now in that case it's at page forty-four of my bundle of
authorities

<ICE-SIN:S2A-062#36:1:A>
It is page forty-four your Honour

<ICE-SIN:S2A-062#37:1:A>
This was a case by a husband and wife against the nursing home for
negligence causing injuries to the wife

<ICE-SIN:S2A-062#38:1:A>
At the first instance your Honour the trial judge held and allowed
the plaintiff's claim

<ICE-SIN:S2A-062#39:1:A>
In the Court of Appeal the defendants succeeded

<ICE-SIN:S2A-062#40:1:A>
The House of Lords your Honour reverse the decision of the court of
appeal and affirmed the decision of the trial judge

<ICE-SIN:S2A-062#41:1:A>
Your Honour again the observations made by that court are relevant
to the present proceedings

<ICE-SIN:S2A-062#42:1:A>
I would refer your Honour to page fifty

<ICE-SIN:S2A-062#43:1:A>
At page fifty the decision the judgment of Viscount Selkie L C
seven lines from the bottom your Honour he says that on an appeal against a
judgement of a judge sitting alone the court of appeal will not set aside the
judgment unless the appellant satisfies the court that the judge was wrong
and that his decision ought to have been the other way

<ICE-SIN:S2A-062#44:1:A>
Where there has been a conflict of evidence your Honour the court
of appeal will have special regard to the fact that the judge saw the
witnesses and he refers to the case of Clark versus Edinburgh Tramways where
it was said that when a judge hears and see witnesses and makes a conclusion
or inference with regard to what is the weight on balance of their evidence
that judgment is entitled to great respect

<ICE-SIN:S2A-062#45:1:A>
And that quite and your Honour I place emphasis on this quite
irrespective of whether the judge makes any observation with regard to
credibility or not

<ICE-SIN:S2A-062#46:1:A>
There is no need your Honour for a trial judge to say I think that
this witness is incredible he is a liar

<ICE-SIN:S2A-062#47:1:A>
There is no need for that your Honour

<ICE-SIN:S2A-062#48:1:A>
It goes on to say I can of course quite understand a court of
appeal that says that it will not interfere in a case in which the judge has
announced as part of his judgment that he believes one set of witnesses
having seen and heard them and does not believe another

<ICE-SIN:S2A-062#49:1:A>
But that is not the ordinary case of a cause in a court of justice

<ICE-SIN:S2A-062#50:1:A>
In courts of justice in the ordinary case things are much more
evenly divided

<ICE-SIN:S2A-062#51:1:A>
Witnesses without any conscious bias towards the conclusion may
have in their demeanor in their manner in their hesitation in their nuance of
their expression in even the turns of the eye-lids left an impression upon
the man who saw and heard them which can never be reproduced in the printed
page

<ICE-SIN:S2A-062#52:1:A>
What in such circumstances thus psychologically put is the duty of
an appellate court

<ICE-SIN:S2A-062#53:1:A>
In my opinion the duty of an appellate court in those circumstances
is for each judge of it to put to himself as I now do in this case the
question am I who sit here without those advantages sometimes broad and
sometimes subtle which are the privilege of the judge who heard and tried the
case in the position not having those privileges to come to a clear
conclusion that the judge who had them was plainly wrong

<ICE-SIN:S2A-062#54:1:A>
If I cannot be satisfied in my mind that the judge with those
privileges was plainly wrong then it appears to me to be my duty to defer to
his judgment

<ICE-SIN:S2A-062#55:1:A>
Again very quickly your Honour I would also refer to page fifty-two
your Honour and that is somewhere in the middle third-quarter of the page
just before the end of penultimate paragraph of his judgment

<ICE-SIN:S2A-062#56:1:A>
He said having regard to the facts it is in my view quite
impossible to say that the learned judge was wrong in coming to the
conclusion he arrived at in favour of the plaintiff

<ICE-SIN:S2A-062#57:1:A>
So your Honour there is essentially a difficult task on the part of
Appellant in a case such where a finding of fact is involved and more so in
the case of an accident

<ICE-SIN:S2A-062#58:1:A>
Your Honour the next part of the judgment is at page fifty-six your
Honour and that is the decision of Lord Atkin

<ICE-SIN:S2A-062#59:1:A>
I shan't take your Honour longer on this case except to refer to
page fifty-six and to say that and to refer to the decision

<ICE-SIN:S2A-062#60:1:A>
I wish to express my concurrence in the view that on appeals from
the decision of a judge sitting without a jury the jurisdiction of the Court
of Appeal is free and unrestricted

<ICE-SIN:S2A-062#61:1:A>
The court has to re-hear in other words has the same right to come
to decisions on the issues of facts as well as law as the trial judge

<ICE-SIN:S2A-062#62:1:A>
But the court is still a Court of Appeal and in exercising its
functions is subject to the inevitable qualifications of that position

<ICE-SIN:S2A-062#63:1:A>
It must recognise the onus upon the appellant to satisfy that the
decision below is wrong it must recognise the essential advantage of the
trial judge in seeing the witnesses and watching their demeanor

<ICE-SIN:S2A-062#64:1:A>
In cases which turn on the conflicting testimony of witnesses and
the belief to be reposed in them an appellate court can never recapture the
initial advantage of the judge who saw and believed and in no cases should
this advantage be more readily recognised than in cases which involve
character and reputation

<ICE-SIN:S2A-062#65:1:A>
And your Honour the judge concluded Lord Atkin again at the bottom
of this page he says that I have

<ICE-SIN:S2A-062#66:1:A>
Has your Honour got that

<ICE-SIN:S2A-062#67:1:A>
I have not tried to form any opinion as to what judgment

<ICE-SIN:S2A-062#68:1:A>
I should have given if I had seen the witnesses myself

<ICE-SIN:S2A-062#69:1:A>
There is no need for your Honour to ask yourself what would I have
decided

<ICE-SIN:S2A-062#70:1:A>
Your Honour the onus is always on the Appellant

<ICE-SIN:S2A-062#71:1:A>
If he cannot discharge the onus to show that the judge was wrong he
fails

<ICE-SIN:S2A-062#72:1:A>
Your Honour the next case which I would refer to I would skip case
D and that's a decision of Watt versus Thomas that's been referred to by my
learned friend it essentially says the same thing

<ICE-SIN:S2A-062#73:1:A>
But I would refer your Honour to the last case which I have in my
skeletal arguments and that's the decision of Benlax versus Austin Motor at
page seventy-seven of my bundle

<ICE-SIN:S2A-062#74:1:A>
Your Honour this case I believe is a case which has been relied
upon heavily by my learned friend that the court drew a distinction between
the evaluation and perception of facts your Honour

<ICE-SIN:S2A-062#75:1:A>
And the facts in this case your Honour concern the existence of an
inventive step whether or not a certain pattern was valid

<ICE-SIN:S2A-062#76:1:A>
Your Honour the relevant parts which I would quote your Honour is
at page seventy-eight and that's the decision or Viscount Simmons <X>

<ICE-SIN:S2A-062#X77:1:A>
At the last paragraph your Honour somewhere third line from the
top where he says after reviewing the previous authorities he says but I
cannot help thinking that some confusion may have arisen from failure to
distinguish between the finding of a specific fact and the finding of fact
which is really an inference from facts specifically found

<ICE-SIN:S2A-062#X78:1:A>
My learned friend has sought to argue that what the trial judge
did was an inference not of specific facts but merely on what he would say
inferential findings

<ICE-SIN:S2A-062#X79:1:A>
But your Honour Viscount Simmons himself drew a distinction and he
referred to a case concerning negligence on the part of the defendant when he
says that it first must be as determined whether the defendant in fact did
and secondly whether what he did amounted in the circumstances to negligence
