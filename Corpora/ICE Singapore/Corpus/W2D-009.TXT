<h> CHAPTER 6 </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2D-009#6:1>
It has been said that in order to see the future one should look at
today's young.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-009#7:1>
Looking at the young in Singapore today, one would have mixed feelings
about the future, if the standards of the old are to be applied.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-009#8:1>
The Prime Minister, Lee Kuan Yew, surprised everyone, young and old,
when he said in November 1988 in Australia that he was not sure if " this
man-made article called Singapore" would still exist in a hundred years.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-009#9:1>
About six months later, in an interview on the BBC World Service, he
again expressed his worry about the country's long-term future.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-009#10:1>
He said: They ( the younger generation) think they have all the
freedom of choice now of a mature, developed society.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-009#11:1>
I do not believe that.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-009#12:1>
And they will discover it to be so.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-009#13:1>
My problem is that the tide is still against us, and a younger
generation believes it isn't.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-009#14:1>
But I know it is.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-009#15:1>
But why the gulf?

<ICE-SIN:W2D-009#16:1>
The younger generation is but a product of a successful older
generation.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-009#17:1>
Kernial Singh Sandhu and Paul Wheatley, the editors of the
recently-published Management of Success: The Moulding of Modern Singapore,
ended their book by stating that " the fundamental issue facing Singapore in
the years ahead will be not only how to achieve success but even more
importantly how to manage it once achieved".

<ICE-SIN:W2D-009#18:1>
They also expressed their doubts " how long a demographically
youthful, affluent, well-educated, globally-informed, travelled,
English-speaking ( and therefore open to foreign influence) population will
be content with a centrally-managed, petitionary political culture largely
devoid of the give and take of practical politics".

<ICE-SIN:W2D-009#19:1>
The young have seen nothing more serious than the economic recession
of 1985 which the present government managed to turn around fast - apparently
to the regret of some older generation leaders.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-009#20:1>
For them it was a missed opportunity to let the younger generation
taste the kind of hardships they had experienced.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-009#21:1>
The founding generation faced worse problems including the lack of
resources yet they were able to harness their collective strengths and were
able to build the unique Singapore that many young people now take for
granted.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-009#22:1>
The leaders have been quick to remind younger Singaporeans of the
nation's vulnerabilities.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-009#23:1>
Singapore's basic constraints - geo-political realities, geography,
land, water, population, short history, lack of strong cultural roots and its
multi-racial, multi-religious constitution - all add up to a situation of
some fragility.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-009#24:1>
Indeed, the Prime Minister has described Singapore as " a very
unlikely country" in his National Day Rally speech in August 1987.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-009#25:1>
He quoted Rupert Emerson to show how formidable the task of
nation-building can be and another American scholar, Professor Robert Tilman,
to show how " geography, history, language, and culture have all conspired
against the countries of ASEAN to make their task of nation-building and
economic development more difficult".

<ICE-SIN:W2D-009#26:1>
The process of nation-building may be formidable, but many in the
younger generation will object to any implied doubts about their calibre or
ability to cope with Singapore's potential problems.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-009#27:1>
They will say that, after all, men are products of their own times.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-009#28:1>
In a letter to the Straits Times, a young Singaporean studying at
Cambridge University wrote:

<ICE-SIN:W2D-009#29:1>
Today's young Singaporeans are shaped by the successes of a modern
nation as much as Mr Lee and his older colleagues were galvanised by the
failures of a falling colony.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-009#30:1>
The political generation gap is as difficult to close as it is to
bridge the difference between a straight-laced mother and a fun-loving
daughter.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-009#31:1>
It is difficult, human nature being what it is, to expect a young
generation brought up in a crisis-free era to inherit the crisis mentality
characteristic of the Old Guard.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-009#32:1>
He added that while young Singaporeans can understand the constraints
and vulnerabilities on the intellectual plane, there can be no empathy
because they were never a part of those crises that brought home the sense of
being on the knife-edge.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-009#33:1>
<h> DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENT </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2D-009#34:1>
Today's young Singaporeans share a substantially different
environment from the environment shared in their youth by people who are now
in their forties and sixties.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-009#35:1>
Those who are now in their sixties have faced and survived a world
war.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-009#36:1>
They waged an independence battle against colonial rule.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-009#37:1>
Later, they fought the Communists and communalists and had to
struggle for economic survival after separation from Malaysia.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-009#38:1>
The period between the 1940s and the 1960s was turbulent and
crisis-prone.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-009#39:1>
The whole society seemed to be under siege by common threats from
common foes.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-009#40:1>
In such circumstances the ethnic communities and different classes of
people were able to suppress their differences and rally to common causes.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-009#41:1>
A fraternal bond was forged among them despite class differences and
little understanding of each other's ethnicity.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-009#42:1>
The people as well as the leaders of that generation subscribed to
common goals that were wrought out of common suffering and shared
experiences.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-009#43:1>
There was also another force that added impetus to this process the
burning desire, especially among the immigrant communities, to do-well.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-009#44:1>
In his National Day message in 1989, the Prime Minister drew
attention to the keenness and the spirit of Singaporeans which gave the
country its competitive edge.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-009#45:1>
He said: This comes from our immigrant culture.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-009#46:1>
Our forefathers had left their homelands to make good in a strange
land and were determined to succeed, keen to achieve their best.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-009#47:1>
The determination to work hard and to achieve became a habit which
they passed on to their children.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-009#48:1>
But after the second generation, and more often, many years of
comfortable growth and prosperity, we have tended to take things for granted.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-009#49:1>
<h> THE NEXT GENERATION </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2D-009#50:1>
Those of the next generation, who are in their forties today, were
witnesses to, if not participants in, many of the historical developments of
the 1960s.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-009#51:1>
They also carried with them memories of an earlier era transmitted
through their parents.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-009#52:1>
They were filled with the drive not just to survive but to succeed.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-009#53:1>
Though they did not go through the trauma of a war or the political
upheavals of a nationalist struggle, they did wrestle with the problems of a
bleak and gravely uncertain economic future and the constant threat of
Communist and communalist undercurrents which burst out sporadically.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-009#54:1>
Street battles waged by the Communist and united front elements and
sympathizers during the late 1950s and early 1960s are well documented.10
Memories of the Maria Hertogh riots of 1950 my be vague and fading but
memories of the racial-religious riots of the 1960s certainly are not.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-009#55:1>
Scenes of hundreds of innocent Malays and Chinese being injured,
maimed or killed in the heat of the emotional turmoil are still vivid in the
minds of many who were unlucky enough to be on the streets during the sudden
and unexpected outburst of racial violence in 1964.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-009#56:1>
Singaporeans of that generation know the price many had to pay for
primordial sentiments.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-009#57:1>
But it made them more determined to weld together disparate cultural
and ethnic identities to form a recognizable and viable Singaporean image,
with racial and religious harmony as a cornerstone for future security and
prosperity.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-009#58:1>
There is some question about whether this enthusiasm would have
lasted long had Singapore's veteran politicians known what lay ahead.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-009#59:1>
As Lee Kuan Yew recalled in 1979: Although we knew it was going to be
a difficult task to create a better life for all, it was as well that we did
not realise how daunting were the problems of building a nation out of
peoples of totally different races, languages, religions and cultures.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-009#60:1>
I would be appalled if I am asked to start off all over again on 21
November 1954 with the heavy knowledge of the almost irreconcilable divisions
which were to open up.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-009#61:1>
In helping to build an independent, stable and prosperous nation,
this generation of Singaporeans was again largely united, focused and
politically cooperative.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-009#62:1>
The social glue was further strengthened by government initiatives in
public housing, bilingualism and National Service, as discussed in Chapter 4.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-009#63:1>
<h> TODAY'S YOUNG SINGAPOREANS </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2D-009#64:1>
Those in their twenties and below today have grown up in a very
different Singapore and carry little of the mental or emotional baggage of
the previous generations.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-009#65:1>
Today's young Singaporeans are the product of a rapidly modernizing
and Westernizing environment.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-009#66:1>
They have grown up in a period when social and political changes were
managed peaceably without the cathartic upheavals of the past.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-009#67:1>
It was also a period when sustained economic growth had brought about
a widespread feeling of economic well-being, even affluence.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-009#68:1>
However, there was a negative side, identified in strong terms by Ho
Wing Meng.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-009#69:1>
He wrote: Increasingly, acquisitiveness has become the very soul of
society, penetrating almost every aspect of social life and thought.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-009#70:1>
Everything has a price attached to it, so much so that Singaporeans,
especially during the 1970s when the economy grew by leaps and bounds,
appeared to be fast developing a system of values according to which the
worth or significance of any person, object or activity was calculated
exclusively in terms of his or its potential or actual pecuniary value.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-009#71:1>
It was the market value ( an expression which was used with
increasing frequency) of any person, his services or his goods in terms of
dollars and cents which mattered most, and anything which was not reducible
to such quantitative terms ( for example love, courage, honour, sacrifice,
integrity, selflessness, each with its irreducible qualitative wholeness) was
largely ignored or at best regarded with mild contempt.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-009#72:1>
But for all the negative factors of material success, the positive
aspects had added up to establish in the minds of the young a sense of
security and self-assuredness.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-009#73:1>
According to Ho Wing Meng: By 1984, the government had become so
confident of its record of success through good planning and efficient
administration that Mr Goh Chok Tong, First Deputy Prime Minister, could
unveil his 'Vision for Singapore by the year 2000'.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-009#74:1>
According to this vision, by the end of this century Singaporeans can
aspire to a standard of living comparable to that which the Swiss enjoy today
provided they maintain the pace of economic growth at between 6 and 8 per
cent per annum over the next one-and-a-half decades.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-009#75:1>
It is expected that by then the per capita income of Singapore will
have grown to about USS 15,000.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-009#76:1>
However, in order to attain this level of wealth Singaporeans will
have to release what Mr Goh describes as " a second burst of energy" through
hard work, greater productivity, the development of higher skills, and the
use of higher technologies and methods of automation in industry.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-009#77:1>
15 The same theme was taken up by Trade and Industry Minister Lee
Hsien Loong before senior civil servants and corporate chief executives at a
National Marketing Workshop in August 1989, when he said the new generation
of Singaporeans had the resources and opportunities to transform Singapore
once again, just as the earlier generation had transformed it from a poor
developing country into a new industrializing economy.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-009#78:1>
According to him, the challenge for the new generation is to sustain
and build upon this success for another quarter century.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-009#79:1>
Such a rebuilding, in terms of the physical environment, education,
health care, standard of living and personal fulfillment, depended on
continued social cohesion, political stability, and economic growth and
vitality.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-009#80:1>
A glance at the Taiwanese experience is instructive in this context.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-009#81:1>
Chan Hung-Chih, author of the 'Index of Trends" wrote in 1989 that
Taiwan's youth " no longer play the role of appendages to adults or schools;
they are now an independent group.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-009#82:1>
Their identity is nowhere more clearly defined than in their buying
power".

<ICE-SIN:W2D-009#83:1>
The new consumerism in Taiwan has already prompted criticism of
today's youth as materialistic and utilitarian.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-009#84:1>
The older generation, who experienced war, dislocation from homes,
and extreme poverty, complain that young people lack the high aspirations
they had in their time, especially loyalty to country and the people. <X>

<ICE-SIN:W2D-009#X85:1>
Singapore's sustained growth and the resultant feeling of economic
confidence also created a popular perception that there was room to " try
something different".

<ICE-SIN:W2D-009#X86:1>
But it was not an idea that created a commonality among those who
subscribed to it.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-009#X87:1>
There were glaring differences between them, in their backgrounds
and their process of socialization.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-009#X88:1>
Whereas the early Chinese were predominantly either Taoist or
Buddhist or practised ancestor worship, more and more Chinese today have
become or are becoming Confucianist or converting to Christianity.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-009#X89:1>
There is a discernible trend among the Chinese to profess
agnosticism as a preference. </X> </I>
