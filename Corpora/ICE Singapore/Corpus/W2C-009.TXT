<h> Dismissals reflect widespread ignorance of disease </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2C-009#4:1>
THREE jobs in two months - but Mr Lewis Williams is not a job-hopper.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-009#5:1>
His services have been terminated on each occasion by employers
because he suffers from epilepsy, a condition where a person has recurrent
seizures According to five neurologists interviewed by The Straits Times,
such cases are not uncommon.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-009#6:1>
In some of them, the doctors have had to intervene on behalf of their
patients and plead with employers not to sack them.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-009#7:1>
They said that this action reflects widespread ignorance about the
disease, which affects about 1 per cent of the population here.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-009#8:1>
Relating his experience, Mr Williams, 36, said that every time he
suffered a seizure at his workplace, it spelt doom Two of his employers, a
multinational and a reputable company, told him that it was dangerous for him
to continue his work as a technician.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-009#9:1>
The third company, where he worked as a storekeeper, felt that it was
" very bad for business if customers witnessed him having an attack".

<ICE-SIN:W2C-009#10:1>
He said: " It was very frustrating because I only had the fits on a
few occasions when I was under stress or felt tired.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-009#11:1>
Most of the time, I worked well".

<ICE-SIN:W2C-009#12:1>
At present, he is working in an office as a general worker.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-009#13:1>
When contacted, a personnel officer of one of the companies said that
it had to take such action because his safety could not be guaranteed if he
suffered a fit on the workfloor.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-009#14:1>
It was also disruptive to other workers.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-009#15:1>
Epilepsy takes many forms.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-009#16:1>
Some patients lose consciousness and are hit by convulsions, or
appear dazed or confused.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-009#17:1>
Others have strange sensations in the stomach or limbs.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-009#18:1>
The disorder can be caused by many factors, including head injuries,
tumours and brain infections.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-009#19:1>
But often, no cause can be found.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-009#20:1>
Neurologists interviewed said they have come across such cases as Mr
Williams'.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-009#21:1>
Dr Tang Kok Foo, a private practitioner, said that five of his
epileptic patients lost their jobs.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-009#22:1>
A similar situation was reported by Dr Michael Cbee, senior registrar
at Tan Tock Seng Hospital's Department of Neurology.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-009#23:1>
He said: " It is sad when employers react this way because these
people are normal 99 per cent of the time.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-009#24:1>
And even when they do suffer an epileptic attack, it is only for a
few seconds.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-009#25:1>
Another neurologist, who is in private practice, said that a number
of his patients have lost their jobs.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-009#26:1>
He said: It is a question of employers being afraid of being held
responsible if any accident happens to someone suffering a seizure".

<ICE-SIN:W2C-009#27:1>
This fear could be overcome by making these employees sign a form,
absolving the company of any responsibility for injuries suffered during a
fit he said.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-009#28:1>
Doctors also said that ignorance about the disorder was another
stumbling block.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-009#29:1>
For example, a survey in 1989 by a group of medical students showed
that 20 per cent of those interviewed felt that the disease was contagious.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-009#30:1>
Another 54 per cent thought that epileptics should stay at home.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-009#31:1>
Don't put hard objects in mouth.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-009#32:1>
DO NOT shove a spoon or other metal objects into the mouth of someone
who is suffering an epileptic seizure.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-009#33:1>
It will result in the person ending up with crooked teeth, or even
worse, no teeth.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-009#34:1>
Dr Michael Chee, senior registrar at Tan Tock Seng Hospital's
Department of Neurology, said: " People put something hard into the mouth of
an epileptic person believing that it will prevent him from biting off his
tongue.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-009#35:1>
This is a mistake.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-009#36:1>
The hard object may even be dangerous to the person".

<ICE-SIN:W2C-009#37:1>
He said that there was little danger of someone who is suffering from
a seizure biting off his tongue.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-009#38:1>
If the person bites his tongue really hard, the brain will send a
signal, pain will be registered and the patient will relax the grip, he said.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-009#39:1>
His advice to the public: let the seizure run its course.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-009#40:1>
Give someone who is suffering from fits space and do not attempt to
restrain him.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-009#41:1>
He said: " He becomes aggressive if pinned down.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-009#42:1>
Give him space and the attack will be over in a few seconds." But
intervene if the epileptic person is having an attack near a busy road or in
an area where he is likely to be in some danger.

Private doctors urged to join forces to cut costs

<ICE-SIN:W2C-009#44:1>
SMA feels pooling will help curb steep increases

<ICE-SIN:W2C-009#45:1>
By Brendan Pereira

<ICE-SIN:W2C-009#46:1>
DOCTORS intending to enter private practice are being encouraged to
form partnerships to cut overheads and put a lid on increases in health care
costs.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-009#47:1>
At the same time, the Singapore Medical Association ( SMA) is also
getting existing clinics run by sole practitioners to pool their resources
and upgrade their practices.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-009#48:1>
Dr Tan Eok Soo, president of SMA, said that by pooling resources,
clinics will be able to offer services such as blood and electrocardiogram (
ECG) tests for heart diseases.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-009#49:1>
In an interview with The Straits Times he said that primary health
care costs are likely to rise in the next few years, largely because of the
high salary for staff and high rentals of shophouses and units.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-009#50:1>
One way to tackle this problem is by persuading doctors just
beginning their practices to form partnerships to share equipment, premises
and staff to cut costs.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-009#51:1>
A possible benefit from this move is that with starting up costs
under control, consumers will not face steep charges.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-009#52:1>
Dr Tan said: " I do not think it's possible to say that patients will
pay less if doctors practise economy of scale".

<ICE-SIN:W2C-009#53:1>
" It is more likely that steep increases will be a thing of the past
in primary health care".

<ICE-SIN:W2C-009#54:1>
He said that at present, the rental and purchase of Housing Board
shop lots represents the biggest overhead cost for doctors.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-009#55:1>
Some sole practitioners are paying as much as
&dollar;7,O0O a month for rental in areas such as Simei and Yishun.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-009#56:1>
Others who buy their own units are paying astronomical amounts.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-009#57:1>
In fact, one doctor bought a unit in a popular area in Choa Chu Kang
for
&dollar;1.2 million, Dr Tan said.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-009#58:1>
He said: " If doctors have to pay such large amounts, it is likely
that they will have to pass on some of the costs to consumers.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-009#59:1>
That is why SMA is trying to encourage doctors to join forces.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-009#60:1>
" This will lessen the burden on themselves and also their
customers".

<ICE-SIN:W2C-009#61:1>
It is learnt that doctors who pay higher rental are charging about
&dollar;2 to
&dollar;3 more for consultation than their counterparts in older estates.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-009#62:1>
At present, there are about 800 medical clinics in Singapore.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-009#63:1>
In addition to being cost-effective, partnerships also mean that
clinics can stay open for longer hours and waiting time is reduced.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-009#64:1>
Also, with other doctors to share the patient load, a doctor can
spend more time with each patient.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-009#65:1>
A doctor in private practice for the last eight years agreed that
forming partnerships has its advantages.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-009#66:1>
He said: " A second opinion is readily available within the same
premises".

<ICE-SIN:W2C-009#67:1>
Another strategy by the SMA is to persuade existing one-doctor
clinics to pool their resources and upgrade their practices.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-009#68:1>
More than 90 per cent of private clinics are run by sole
practitioners.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-009#69:1>
Dr Tan said that at present, it is not viable for general
practitioners to buy better medical equipment.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-009#70:1>
But this problem can be solved if doctors pooled their resources.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-009#71:1>
For example, two clinics within walking distance in an area such as
Bishan could team up and buy equipment which would complement each other.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-009#72:1>
One clinic could have an instant blood testing unit and another an
ECG machine.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-009#73:1>
Said Dr Tan: " With the emphasis now on primary health care and
family doctors, I think the public's expectations of general practitioners
will go up.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-009#74:1>
" This is one way in which we can keep pace with their expectations.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-009#75:1>
Instead of going to specialists or to hospitals for these tests, they
can be done at the clinics".

<ICE-SIN:W2C-009#76:1>
Licenses for pet birds?

<ICE-SIN:W2C-009#77:1>
ALL pet birds in Singapore homes are being kept illegally, if one
interprets local environmental laws strictly, said Mr Robert Kwan.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-009#78:1>
Mr Kwan, chairman of the National Council on the Environment, said
that under Singapore's Wild Animals and Birds Act, it is an offence to keep
any bird without a licence.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-009#79:1>
But there are no provisions for the licensing of birds here.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-009#80:1>
He was referring to findings in a paper entitled Wildlife Protection
Laws in Singapore by Associate Professor Lye Lin Heng from the National
University of Singapore's Law faculty.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-009#81:1>
Mr Kwan said that the licensing of birds, for example, would provide
an important check on the legal trade.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-009#82:1>
Smuggling a thing of the past: Bird dealers' group ILLEGAL shipments
of birds are a thing of the past, say the Bird Dealers' Association here.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-009#83:1>
All traders are licensed by the Primary Production Department.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-009#84:1>
Each separate import and export also requires a licence, said an
association spokesman.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-009#85:1>
In response to an earlier statement by National Council on the
Environment chairman Robert Kwan that Singapore was a major transhipment
centre for illegal trade in wildlife, the association said: Mr Kwan's
statement contained remarks that are misleading".

<ICE-SIN:W2C-009#86:1>
The spokesman added that the association was not aware of any traders
involved in smuggling.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-009#87:1>
He said that traders have to produce supporting documents and all
birds are inspected by the PPD for import and export.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-009#88:1>
He added: " This procedure is carried out for all consignments, even
those which are shipped in the middle of the night.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-009#89:1>
With such control, illegal shipments are a thing of the past".

<ICE-SIN:W2C-009#90:1>
But he declined to answer a question on how some birds that are
banned for export in their countries of origin still find their way here.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-009#91:1>
The spokesman said: " Please refer to the PPD.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-009#92:1>
They are in a better position to answer this question".

<ICE-SIN:W2C-009#93:1>
Earlier, Mr Kwan had also said: " In Singapore, we are promoting bird
singing contests.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-009#94:1>
But this is in conflict with wildlife conservation as some of the
birds trapped in the wild are on the endangered list.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-009#95:1>
In response, the spokesman said that keeping songbirds is very much
part of Singapore's cultural heritage and that many of the birds are not
endangered.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-009#96:1>
Besides, some traders have also turned to captive breeding as an
alternative source of supply of birds.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-009#97:1>
He said: " Proper breeding arms ensure a continuous supply of birds.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-009#98:1>
Captive breeding is recognised internationally as an important method
of conserving endangered species".

<ICE-SIN:W2C-009#99:1>
Budgerigars, cockatiels, rosellas, canaries and other bird species
are now being bred in large numbers and have even replaced the demand for
birds caught in the wild.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-009#100:1>
He added that the association's members have also turned to breeding
more endangered species of parrots and other birds as part of their
conservation efforts.

Crowds yet to return to Punggol Point by Dominic Nathan PUNGGOL
Paint has been declared malaria-free, but the crowds have not returned to the
seafood restaurants and boatels in the area yet.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-009#102:1>
But businesses in the area, which now have the Sea Games and wet
weather to contend with, expect things to pick up by the weekend.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-009#103:1>
On Saturday, the Environment Ministry announced that the malaria
outbreak at Punggol Point had ended, and that the last five patients infected
in the area had been treated and discharged.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-009#104:1>
" Malaria, Keep Out" signs, which were put up at various points
along Punggol Road have also been removed.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-009#105:1>
Things are beginning to return to normal slowly at Punggol Point,
the popular haunt of seafood lovers which was like a ghost town in the last
two weeks, after the ministry advised members of the public to stay away.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-009#106:1>
The Marinaview Seafood Restaurant and Boatel reopened for business
over the weekend after being closed for over a week.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-009#107:1>
The restaurant's manager who did not want to be named, said: " Now
that the area is safe again, people are slowly starting to come back.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-009#108:1>
We expect normal business by this weekend".

<ICE-SIN:W2C-009#109:1>
Operators of the other seafood restaurants at Punggol Point also
said that business was picking up slowly. <X>

<ICE-SIN:W2C-009#X110:1>
On Sunday, it improved further.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-009#X111:1>
The turnout was between 30 and 40 per cent of what it used to be.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-009#X112:1>
But yesterday's heavy downpour put a damper on business again.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-009#X113:1>
A helper at one of the restaurants, Mr T H Tan, 34, said: " At
first, they were scared of malaria, and now, everyone is at home watching the
Sea Garnes.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-009#X114:1>
" But by next week, it should be okay".

<ICE-SIN:W2C-009#X115:1>
The only site still closed is the People's Association Punggol
Point Sea Sports Club.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-009#X116:1>
Officials at the PA said that they had no instructions to reopen
the club, which is usually heavily-booked during the June school holidays.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-009#X117:1>
Although the outbreak of the disease has ended, ENV said that it
would continue to maintain a high degree of vigilance over the disease and
mosquito situation.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-009#X118:1>
Active case detection, mass blood surveys and " search and destroy"
operations for the malaria-spreading Anopheles mosquito will continue.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-009#X119:1>
So far this year, the total malaria count stands at 120 cases,
including 94 imported cases ( victims who were infected overseas).

<ICE-SIN:W2C-009#X120:1>
Among the few patrons at the Marina Seafood Restaurant last night
was Mr Richard Tan, 32, and his colleagues He said: " We saw the newspaper
report about the area being safe, so we decided to come here for a meal.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-009#X121:1>
" We were hoping to get a discount on the seafood because I am sure
business has been bad for the restaurant.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-009#X122:1>
Unfortunately for them, some things, such as the prices, have not
changed at Punggol's restaurants, low turnout or not. </X> </I>
