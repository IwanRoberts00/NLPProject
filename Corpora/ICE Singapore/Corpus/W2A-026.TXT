Laser iridotomy in patients with brown irides is more difficult.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-026#5:1>
Two or more treatment sessions are often needed to create a patent
iridotomy.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-026#6:1>
Failure and complication rates are higher.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-026#7:1>
We conducted a short term prospective clinical study to evaluate the
use of the argon and Nd:YAG laser in sequential combination at the same
sitting to create iridotomies in 16 eyes from 10 patients.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-026#8:1>
All the eyes had dark brown irides.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-026#9:1>
These eyes had chronic angle closure glaucoma ( 7 eyes), acute angle
closure ( 3 eyes and 6 were fellow eyes.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-026#10:1>
Patent iridotomies were achieved in single treatment sessions for all
the eyes.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-026#11:1>
Complications were minor and included microhyphaema ( 1 eye), focal
lens opacity ( 1 eye) and focal corneal opacity ( 2 eyes).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-026#12:1>
No iridotomy closure was noted to date.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-026#13:1>
The mean total energy delivered per eye by the argon and Nd:YAG
lasers respectively was about a third of values reported by most studies on
pure argon or Nd:YAG iridotomy.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-026#14:1>
Sequential combination use of the argon and YAG lasers is a safe and
effective iridotomy tool in dark brown irides and combines the advantages of
both laser procedures whilst avoiding most of their disadvantages.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-026#15:1>
<h> Introduction </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-026#16:1>
Various types of lasers have been used to penetrate the iris.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-026#17:1>
Many ophthalmologists consider the Nd:YAG laser the ideal iridotomy
tool especially in the blue irides.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-026#18:1>
However, in patients with brown irides, opinion is divided between
the argon and the Nd:YAG lasers.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-026#19:1>
What about the patient with the dark brown iris?

<ICE-SIN:W2A-026#20:1>
These irides are thicker and have more pigment.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-026#21:1>
The higher complication and failure rates of laser iridotomy in such
patients is well recognised.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-026#22:1>
Schwartz ( 1) using a pulsed argon laser reports 20% failure to
penetrate in brown eyes.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-026#23:1>
Quigley ( 2) reports needing two or more sessions to achieve patent
argon iridotomies in 58% of his patients with dark brown irides.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-026#24:1>
Tomey ( 3) states that the higher amount of YAG laser energy required
by his patients was attributed to the high prevalence of thick, brown irides
among his patient population.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-026#25:1>
The use of the Nd:YAG laser to successfully salvage an otherwise
failed argon iridotomy has been documented by certain authors ( 4, 5).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-026#26:1>
However, to our knowledge no prospective clinical study has been
carried out to evaluate the sequential combined use of the argon and YAG
laser to penetrate the iris as a primary procedure at the same sitting.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-026#27:1>
<h> Materials and Methods </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-026#28:1>
We conducted a short term prospective study to evaluate this
procedure in 16 eyes from 10 patients.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-026#29:1>
All the eyes had the dark brown iris type.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-026#30:1>
We use the Coherent Medical 920 Argon laser with a Zeiss slit-lamp
delivery system for the first stage and the Cooper Vision 2300 Q-Switched
Neodymium YAG laser for the second stage.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-026#31:1>
Topical pilocarpine 2% qid was instilled pre-operatively to
constrict the pupil where possible.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-026#32:1>
After administration of topical anesthesia, an Abraham lens was
placed onto the eye.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-026#33:1>
The argon laser was used to make the initial bore.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-026#34:1>
An iris crypt was selected in the mid-periphery in either the
superior nasal or temporal quadrant.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-026#35:1>
A spot size of 50 microns was used in all the cases.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-026#36:1>
Power and duration of shots were adjusted to achieve penetration with
minimal iris charring ( Table 1).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-026#37:1>
The initial bore is made to an estimated depth of about two-thirds
iris thickness with an approximate diameter of 500 microns.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-026#38:1>
The Nd:YAG laser was used for the second perforation stage.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-026#39:1>
Energy levels were set between 2 to 5 mJ depending on the surgeon's
estimate of the depth of penetration achieved at the end of the first stage.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-026#40:1>
All shots were delivered in single pulse mode.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-026#41:1>
All patients had their IOP measured at I hour post-op.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-026#42:1>
If not greater than 10 mm Hg above pre-op levels they are sent back
with prophylactic diamox 250 mg tid for the next two days.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-026#43:1>
If the IOP rise was greater than 10 mm HG at I hour post-op the
patient was given a stat dose of 500 mg diamox and monitored for up to three
hours, as it is well-documented that most IOP rises occur within the first
three hours post-op ( 7, 8).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-026#44:1>
Topical steroids was given to all patients after the procedure.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-026#45:1>
<h> Results and Discussion </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-026#46:1>
Ten patients ( 16 eyes) were treated between Jan 1989 and Nov 1989.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-026#47:1>
There were nine Chinese and one Indian patient.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-026#48:1>
Six eyes had creeping angle closure glaucoma, three had acute angle
closure and seven were contralateral eyes.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-026#49:1>
Quigley ( 2) reviewing 140 argon iridotomies reports that 58% of his
patients with the dark brown iris tvpe needed two or more treatment sessions
to achieve patency.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-026#50:1>
Tomey ( 3) reviewing 373 Nd:YAG iridotomies done in Saudi Arabia with
a " high prevalence of thick brown irides" reports 31 % of his patients
needing two or more treatment sessions.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-026#51:1>
In our study, patent iridotomies were achieved in all sixteen eyes in
single treatment sessions.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-026#52:1>
The iridotomies created are typically large and round with fairly
sharp edges.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-026#53:1>
This is in contrast with the slit opening of YAG iridotomy and the
argon iridotomy where the hole is smaller with charred edges.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-026#54:1>
Central endothelial cell loss due to the indirect thermal effects of
the argon laser has been reported ( 6): In our study, the mean number of
shots delivered in the first argon laser stage was 50 and in the second YAG
laser stage was 3.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-026#55:1>
The mean energy delivered per eye by the argon and YAG respectively
is about a third of most studies on pure argon and YAG iridotomies ( Tables 1
and 2).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-026#56:1>
This should have a significant bearing on complications resulting
from either direct or indirect thermal damage to the eye.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-026#57:1>
Complications seen were minor.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-026#58:1>
Microhyphaema was seen in 1 eye.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-026#59:1>
This is in contrast to pure YAG iridotomies where about 40% are
complicated by bleeding.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-026#60:1>
This advantage is no doubt conferred by the use of the argon laser as
the first stage laser.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-026#61:1>
One of the major advantages of YAG iridotomy is that it is rarely
associated with focal lens opacification.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-026#62:1>
This is because the zone of optical breakdown and plasma formation
following YAG laser shots extends not distally but proximally towards the
laser source, a phenomenon termed the " plasma shield effect".

<ICE-SIN:W2A-026#63:1>
On the other hand, the incidence of focal lens damage in argon
iridotomy has been reported from 35 to 53% ( 6, 7, 8).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-026#64:1>
The low incidence of focal lens damage in our study is most likely
conferred by the use of the YAG laser at the second stage.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-026#65:1>
The one eye which had this complication incurred it from an
inadvertent argon shot.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-026#66:1>
Focal corneal endothelial opacity was seen in 2 eyes ( 12%) and this
rate is similar to that reported by most studies on pure argon and YAG
iridotomies.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-026#67:1>
Immediately following the procedure, all the eyes had various degrees
of pigment dispersion and free floating debris.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-026#68:1>
However, no clinically significant inflammation was present by the
end of the first week.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-026#69:1>
Pure argon laser iridotomy have reported closure rates of 21% to 30%,
whereas it is well established that YAG laser iridotomy appears to show no
tendency to close in eyes uncomplicated by rubeosis or iritis although the
exact mechanism behind this remains unclear ( 7, 8).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-026#70:1>
In our study, iridotomy closure was noted in only one eye to date.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-026#71:1>
Could the use of the YAG as the second stage laser be the reason for
the low closure rates?

<ICE-SIN:W2A-026#72:1>
Five of the eyes treated had intraocular pressure rise of over 10 mm
Hg within the first hour.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-026#73:1>
All these eyes responded well to diamox treatment.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-026#74:1>
We observed two further advantages from this procedure.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-026#75:1>
First, there is no need to worry about inadvertent retinal damage and
one is therefore not restricted to using only the nasal side for the
iridotomy site.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-026#76:1>
Secondly, the hazardous chipping and enlargement phase necessary in
argon iridotomies is not necessary.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-026#77:1>
Our study suggests that sequential Argon-YAG iridotomy is a safe and
effective procedure and combines the advantages of both laser procedures
whilst avoiding most of their disadvantages.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-026#78:1>
It could well be the ideal iridotomy tool in the dark brown iris. <X>

<h> Summary </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-026#87:1>
A combined trabeculectomy with extracapsular cataract extraction and
posterior chamber implantation or triple procedure was performed on 35
patients.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-026#88:1>
The types of glaucoma include primary open angle, primary chronic
angle closure and acute angle closure glaucoma.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-026#89:1>
There was concurrent moderate to severe cataracts.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-026#90:1>
Results 6 months after surgery showed that 83% had 6/12 or better
vision and 94% had intraocular pressure control of 20 mmHg or less.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-026#91:1>
Only 5% needed adjuvant topical beta blocker therapy.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-026#92:1>
<h> Introduction </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-026#93:1>
The presence of glaucoma, whether open angle or closed angle,
combined with cataract poses a problem in management.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-026#94:1>
There is controversy as to whether it would be better to combine
surgery in a one time procedure or to perform operations for the glaucoma and
cataracts on separate occasions.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-026#95:1>
Recently, the Triple procedure, or extracapsular cataract extraction
and posterior chamber implant combined with trabeculectomy became the
procedure of choice for some surgeons.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-026#96:1>
Because of its good results this may be the ideal procedure for
glaucoma patients who also have cataracts.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-026#97:1>
Papers by Stark, Maumenee and others have shown the efficacy of
triples in open angle glaucoma.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-026#98:1>
We have found that triples are also effective in primary angle
closure glaucoma as well.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-026#99:1>
The patients were reviewed approximately 6 months post surgery.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-026#100:1>
Technique 1) A fornix based conjunctival flap was used.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-026#101:1>
2) The superficial trabeculectomy scleral Qap was dissected and the
partial thickness cataract incision was made.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-026#102:1>
3) A disposable 25 gauge was used to make the anterior capsulotomy.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-026#103:1>
4) The deep scleral tissue of the trabeculectomy was then dissected.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-026#104:1>
5) The wound was extended with corneal scissors.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-026#105:1>
6) The nucleus was then expressed.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-026#106:1>
7) The wound was closed with 6 to 8 interrupted 8/O vicryl sutures
and the cortex was aspirated.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-026#107:1>
8) The implant was inserted in-the-bag with viscoelastic.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-026#108:1>
9) The wound was closed with either interrupted or continuous 10/0.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-026#109:1>
10) The conjunctival Qap was drawn inferiorly and sutured to cover
the trabeculectomy.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-026#110:1>
<h> Results and Discussion </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-026#111:1>
In the majority of cases, ie 94%, there was cataract associated with
uncontrolled glaucoma.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-026#112:1>
In 2 cases or 6%, the glaucoma was medically well-controlled but
surgery for cataracts causing poor vision was imminent and it was felt that a
trabeculectomy would benefit the patient.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-026#113:1>
Nineteen cases or 54% had pre-operative vision of 6/18 to 6/36 and
14 cases or 40% had vision 6/60 or worse.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-026#114:1>
Post-operatively 29 patients or 83% achieved 6/12 or better vision.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-026#115:1>
Six patients or 17% did not achieve 6/12 or better vision.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-026#116:1>
These 6 cases were analysed.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-026#117:1>
Of these 6 cases, one case had a retinal detachment 2 months after
surgery, I had pre-existing retinal branch vein occlusion with maculopathy
and 3 had severe glaucomatous field defect affecting fixation.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-026#118:1>
One case with poor vision was lost to follow-up and we are uncertain
whether the poor vision was due to pre-existing macular pathology was
excluded.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-026#119:1>
29 cases or 83% obtained 6/12 or better vision after surgery.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-026#120:1>
Regarding the types of glaucoma undergoing triple procedure, 57% of
cases had primary open angle glaucoma and 23Co had chronic primary angle
closure glaucoma.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-026#121:1>
Fourteen percent had acute angle closure glaucoma and 6% had
secondary glaucoma.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-026#122:1>
On comparing pre and post-operative intraocular pressure control, we
find pre-operatively 2 cases or 20% had good control with IOP lower than 20
mm Hg with medication.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-026#123:1>
Of those with poor control despite medication, 27 cases or 77% had
IOP between 21 to 39 mm Hg.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-026#124:1>
Six cases or 18% had IOP higher than 40 mm Hg.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-026#125:1>
Postoperatively 33 cases or 94% had IOP lower than 20 mm Hg.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-026#126:1>
Of this group, 5 cases or 14% were on adjuvant topical beta blocker
therapy.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-026#127:1>
Only 2 cases had IOP in the mid-twenties post-operatively and may
require further surgery. <X>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-026#X128:1>
The open angle glaucoma cases had an average pre-operative IOP of
30 mm Hg and an average post-operative pressure of 15 mm Hg.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-026#X129:1>
This is an average pressure decrease of 15 mm Hg after operation.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-026#X130:1>
The Primary Chronic angle closure group had an average pre
operative IOP of 38 mm Hg and an average post-operative IOP of 13 mm Hg.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-026#X131:1>
This is an average IOP decrease of about 25 mm Hg.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-026#X132:1>
The acute angle closure group had an average IOP pre op of 32 mm Hg
and a post op average of 11 mm Hg which is a 21 mm Hg average decrease. </X>
