<ICE-SIN:S2A-026#1:1:A>
I would like to uh welcome all of you uh to this uh fourth
Biotech Workshop for teachers

<ICE-SIN:S2A-026#2:1:A>
Can I just for a show of hand in case somebody here has last year
for this workshop

<ICE-SIN:S2A-026#3:1:A>
If you have come here before you don't have to come again

<ICE-SIN:S2A-026#4:1:A>
I can give you the certificate take the book and go somewhere

<ICE-SIN:S2A-026#5:1:A>
Don't tell anybody

<ICE-SIN:S2A-026#6:1:A>
In anyway somebody has just realised that she has come twice

<ICE-SIN:S2A-026#7:1:A>
No okay so this is your first time here right

<ICE-SIN:S2A-026#8:1:A>
Uhm I'll just fill you in with some background of the workshop that
we have uh done so far

<ICE-SIN:S2A-026#9:1:A>
For the past three years we've been running uh this workshop

<ICE-SIN:S2A-026#10:1:A>
In 1990 uh we ran and 1991 we ran the workshop for cover the junior
college teachers

<ICE-SIN:S2A-026#11:1:A>
And when we finished uhm the whole lot of junior college teachers
we have to go on now to the secondary school teachers

<ICE-SIN:S2A-026#12:1:A>
And last year second uh some of half or probably a third of
secondary school teachers came and this year we are doing the rest

<ICE-SIN:S2A-026#13:1:A>
Uh I'm not sure if we have covered all but uh if we have not then
uhm next year we might have to run another one

<ICE-SIN:S2A-026#14:1:A>
So uhm unless there is a change in policy anywhere whether it's
from Science Centre or from Ministry of Education then we will uh adjust the
curriculum of this workshop accordingly right

<ICE-SIN:S2A-026#15:1:A>
So uh this could well be the last in the series so I hope you'll uh
find this uh uh workshop uh a profitable one

<ICE-SIN:S2A-026#16:1:A>
Our head of department sends uh uh Professor Kon Oi Lian sends her
apologies for not being able to <unclear> word </unclear> <unclear> word
</unclear> you address you

<ICE-SIN:S2A-026#17:1:A>
Uh she's taken away for uh an important meeting so she asked me to
say uh a few words of welcome on her behalf

<ICE-SIN:S2A-026#18:1:A>
Uh we are very pleased to be involved in this uh project uh in
joint collaboration with Science Centre the Singapore Society for
Biochemistry and Molecular Biology

<ICE-SIN:S2A-026#19:1:A>
Uh then the sponsorship of the Economic Development Board uh to
hold this uh kind of workshop

<ICE-SIN:S2A-026#20:1:A>
As we all know that the uh biotechnology is an important industry
in uh there is growth of importance in uh Western nations is therefore
essential for Singapore to have some kind of uh economic some kind of in
growth into this very type of industry

<ICE-SIN:S2A-026#21:1:A>
And to do that we need to raise the general awareness of uh
biotechnology among the populous

<ICE-SIN:S2A-026#22:1:A>
That is why uhm one reason why uh the EDB is sponsoring this uhm
workshop under its education and public awareness scheme under the umbrella
of the National Biotechnology Programme was uh started in 1990

<ICE-SIN:S2A-026#23:1:A>
But uh at this point they are many new <unclear> word </unclear> to
this in biotechnology and that is why our students of today would become the
workforce of tomorrow and uh they should at least have some understanding of
biotechnology

<ICE-SIN:S2A-026#24:1:A>
All we reach students we need to be school and we are educators

<ICE-SIN:S2A-026#25:1:A>
That is why we have this workshop uhm here today

<ICE-SIN:S2A-026#26:1:A>
Uh because uh we may face some uh the uh rush later on maybe it'll
be easier if I were to give you your certificate <unclear> word </unclear>

<ICE-SIN:S2A-026#27:1:A>
I I I trust you all completely I noticed that uh ex uh there are no
uh Miss Mrs Anne Dhanaraj is not here

<ICE-SIN:S2A-026#28:1:A>
Yes Mrs Mary Toh is also not here

<ICE-SIN:S2A-026#29:1:A>
Miss Yeo is also not here so I think it's okay I can give it to you
alright

<ICE-SIN:S2A-026#30:1:A>
Uhm the first few sections are the introduction and <unclear> word
</unclear> <unclear> word </unclear> uhm followed by uhm the green notes of
the the introductory notes of the lecture followed by the laboratory schedule

<ICE-SIN:S2A-026#31:1:A>
There are four practicals that we will be doing in an hour and uh
plus you'll be amazed that how many things you could do in four hours uh four
in in in a short span of one hour plus

<ICE-SIN:S2A-026#32:1:A>
And that would be followed by uh several demonstrations which we'll
divide you into several groups and then we'll go in a circus <unclear> word
</unclear>

<ICE-SIN:S2A-026#33:1:A>
If you don't want you can uh uh uh you can move along to the next
one if you're not interested in whatever station it is okay

<ICE-SIN:S2A-026#34:1:A>
It's not a case of uh do not pass go or do not collect two hundred
dollars straight to jail <unclear> word </unclear> <unclear> word </unclear>

<ICE-SIN:S2A-026#35:1:A>
Well if you're not interested in a particular section just move on
okay

<ICE-SIN:S2A-026#36:1:A>
So it's uh very easy going I hope you have uh relaxing afternoon in
view of the stress that we face as educators of our administrators all the
time

<ICE-SIN:S2A-026#37:1:A>
Uh that is uh off the off the record

<ICE-SIN:S2A-026#38:1:A>
Uhm so uh do refer to these notes that are when we come to that
section now okay

<ICE-SIN:S2A-026#39:1:A>
Uh there are some supplementary notes to accompany these
demonstrations and uh <unclear> word </unclear>

<ICE-SIN:S2A-026#40:1:A>
I would like now to introduce uh Mrs Anne Dhanaraj who has been
working very hard behind the scenes to make sure that uh this project gets
proper funding and uh she's done a lot of work in uh getting our booklet
ready for us

<ICE-SIN:S2A-026#41:1:A>
And uh we in the past few uhm past three years she's been working
also very hard making sure that our provide that continuity in the four
workshops that we've conducted so far

<ICE-SIN:S2A-026#42:1:A>
And she's of course aided by many of her able assistants who are
here with her today and they are seated at the back

<ICE-SIN:S2A-026#43:1:A>
We acknowledge their their uhm very enthusiastic support for this
Biotech Workshop

<ICE-SIN:S2A-026#44:1:A>
In fact I might would like to ask her in fact to say a few words
with regard to uh to the uh the new uh exhibits that will be in stored in
Science Centre soon

<ICE-SIN:S2A-026#45:1:A>
In the pipeline secret at the moment

<ICE-SIN:S2A-026#46:1:A>
So what's this phase

<ICE-SIN:S2A-026#47:1:A>
Okay so uhm there will be a brief break where you can have some
refreshments uh in the middle

<ICE-SIN:S2A-026#48:1:A>
I am sorry it's a bit modest one uhm in view of the fact that we
want to save avoid being too much of a consumer

<ICE-SIN:S2A-026#49:1:A>
So I shall not uhm move on quickly to uh first part of our today's
uh uh <unclear> word </unclear>

<ICE-SIN:S2A-026#50:1:A>
Did you all a <unclear> word </unclear> outline of the the the
programme

<ICE-SIN:S2A-026#51:1:A>
They are so <unclear> word </unclear>

<ICE-SIN:S2A-026#52:1:A>
Got a couple of lectures until about three o'clock and these will
be very short ones

<ICE-SIN:S2A-026#53:1:A>
Announcement that we have to cater to a wide spectrum of people
coming from uh diverse back from diverse background and you we have uhm
assume certain target words that uhm you should know uhm and you know and
this will give us our later <unclear> word </unclear>

<ICE-SIN:S2A-026#54:1:A>
Stop us uhm stop me in the in the middle of my talk to ask me
questions okay

<ICE-SIN:S2A-026#55:1:A>
Otherwise follow me later on and uh squeeze out definitions from me
later uhm for use in practicals

<ICE-SIN:S2A-026#56:1:A>
You can catch hold of me

<ICE-SIN:S2A-026#57:1:A>
There are some people who came in just came in right

<ICE-SIN:S2A-026#58:1:A>
Did I miss out you certificates

<ICE-SIN:S2A-026#59:1:A>
Now we begin by uh uh discussing some ideas about what
Biotechnology is

<ICE-SIN:S2A-026#60:1:A>
Uh what better way than to begin in Singapore The Minister of State
has identified biotechnology as one of the twin pillars of Singapore's future
economy the other being Information technology

<ICE-SIN:S2A-026#61:1:A>
And which is why uh in the nine early part of this decade the
national biotechnology plans was formulated in order to spearhead Singapore's
entry into this new start rise so called start rise industry which has uh
caused a great move in the Western countries

<ICE-SIN:S2A-026#62:1:A>
Of course a lot of these uh media uh hype about hype about
biotechnology was uhm overplayed up uh but we are slowly beginning to see the
fruits of uhm biotechnology

<ICE-SIN:S2A-026#63:1:A>
For instance uh recombinant human insulin is now uh in the market

<ICE-SIN:S2A-026#64:1:A>
We have recombinant some of us may have received uh jabs of a
vaccine jabs of uh uh hepatitis B vaccine

<ICE-SIN:S2A-026#65:1:A>
Previously we have to uh round up all the uh homosexuals to uh
extract syrum <unclear> word </unclear> from them and uh try to purify these
thin <unclear> word </unclear> particles and then try to formulate the
vaccine out of them

<ICE-SIN:S2A-026#66:1:A>
And of course that is extremely hazardous both for the for the
people who prepare it as well as the recipients of this plasma based vaccine

<ICE-SIN:S2A-026#67:1:A>
But with Biotechnological approaches uh is able we are able now to
produce safe vaccines for the general uh use by the population

<ICE-SIN:S2A-026#68:1:A>
So you can see that some of these material and and later on in the
practical

<ICE-SIN:S2A-026#69:1:A>
You will see some of these Biotechnology products that are hitting
the consumer market

<ICE-SIN:S2A-026#70:1:A>
That is why all the more reason we should have some basic awareness
of it's all about

<ICE-SIN:S2A-026#71:1:A>
Because of the Biotechnology has been <unclear> word </unclear>
identified as important way back in the 19 in the middle of the last decade
in 1985

<ICE-SIN:S2A-026#72:1:A>
I remember as a a young student <unclear> word </unclear> to say
that but student in the in the in university <unclear> word </unclear> in
university college

<ICE-SIN:S2A-026#73:1:A>
I I drop by at uh Professor uh Louie Lim and Chris Tan <unclear>
word </unclear> place down in London and they were so enthusiastic about this
particular new venture

<ICE-SIN:S2A-026#74:1:A>
Goh Keng Swee has uh Mr Goh Keng Swee has Dr Goh Keng Swee
apparently had called up Professor Chris Tan uh assigned him this task of
setting up the Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology and they were so keen

<ICE-SIN:S2A-026#75:1:A>
And <unclear> word </unclear> in the East end of London Professor
Louie Lim was spreading out the plans of this particular institute on his uh
beautiful floor and then telling me how nice it was and uh I was hoping that
I've got a place there

<ICE-SIN:S2A-026#76:1:A>
Of course I didn't

<ICE-SIN:S2A-026#77:1:A>
Uh this institute has been set up built in 1987 bring in quite a
lot of uh outside talent as well as homegrown talent

<ICE-SIN:S2A-026#78:1:A>
Uh to spearhead research basic research into Molecular Biology and
Cell Biology and you can see this blue building as you approach uh <unclear>
word </unclear> the university

<ICE-SIN:S2A-026#79:1:A>
You can see the building set behind the uh uh greenery of uh Kent
Ridge reserve

<ICE-SIN:S2A-026#80:1:A>
This building with its cutting edge <unclear> word </unclear> at
the cutting edge of research even the architecture reflects its uh role in uh
spearheading Singapore bi bioscience

<ICE-SIN:S2A-026#81:1:A>
Of course this research has been going on kind of research has been
basic research has been going on in our de departments for a long time

<ICE-SIN:S2A-026#82:1:A>
And some of you may identify your former mentors

<ICE-SIN:S2A-026#83:1:A>
But we have progress a long way since these old equip type of
equipments uh to sophisticated equipments such as uh this instruments uh

<ICE-SIN:S2A-026#84:1:A>
HALC type of performance or high pressured liquid chomotography uh
uh equipment

<ICE-SIN:S2A-026#85:1:A>
And not only that we have uh the research as spilled out from the
laboratories to the uh to the field and you can see here a map of Singapore
with marked ingredients marked in green the agrotechnology <unclear> word
</unclear> parks uh that has been set up by the Primary Production Department

<ICE-SIN:S2A-026#86:1:A>
Uh some of these sites are already uh ready and uh some uh
agrotechnology farms have been set up

<ICE-SIN:S2A-026#87:1:A>
So if you do have a chance to uh drive around the outskirts of
Singapore city do feel free to turn off the beating <unclear> word </unclear>
track and visit some of them <unclear> word </unclear>

<ICE-SIN:S2A-026#88:1:A>
Have a look at some of these agrotechnology parks

<ICE-SIN:S2A-026#89:1:A>
Uhm some some of these uh are employing new techniques to culture
or to grow orchids or hydrofornics <unclear> word </unclear> culture of uh
all sorts of uhm vegetables and so on

<ICE-SIN:S2A-026#90:1:A>
So again we are just not confining our our inroads into
Biotechnology within the laboratory but also uh in more diverse over
diversified front

<ICE-SIN:S2A-026#91:1:A>
I noticed <unclear> word </unclear> from yesterday that this was
blocking the view yah

<ICE-SIN:S2A-026#92:1:A>
Fine I will lower this slightly

<ICE-SIN:S2A-026#93:1:A>
Now bio <unclear> word </unclear> allow me to focus uhm

<ICE-SIN:S2A-026#94:1:A>
Now the word biotechnology actually is a very loose term and uh
many disciplines contribute to the this uh multi-disciplinary subject ranging
from genetics biochemistry chemistry microbiology even across to uh the hard
sciences and engineering <X>

<ICE-SIN:S2A-026#X95:1:A>
And uh as I describe biotechnology later on you will see why
Because of this multi-disciplinary approach towards biotechnology it is not
surprising that there are many definitions </X> </I>
