<ICE-SIN:S2A-037#1:1:A>
Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen

<ICE-SIN:S2A-037#2:1:A>
Welcome to the Lexmark product announcement perhaps uh from major
announcement of the year

<ICE-SIN:S2A-037#3:1:A>
Let me first of all extent a warm welcome to all our customers and
also I understand our friendly competitors who are with us today

<ICE-SIN:S2A-037#4:1:A>
I would like to congratulate most of you who have come here through
the heavy rain

<ICE-SIN:S2A-037#5:1:A>
I understand that is going on outside or uh has it stop since I've
been in here

<ICE-SIN:S2A-037#6:1:A>
I know most of you would have a busy schedule and I'm delighted to
have the opportunity to present to you the latest Lexmark family of printers

<ICE-SIN:S2A-037#7:1:A>
We are very excited and optimistic about this new product

<ICE-SIN:S2A-037#8:1:A>
In the next thirty odd minutes I hope to cover all these new
benefits the that our new range of printers are going to provide you

<ICE-SIN:S2A-037#9:1:A>
And I hope you'll be so persuaded that when you think of Lexmark
when you think of laser printers it is either the IBM laser printers or the
Lexmark laser printers

<ICE-SIN:S2A-037#10:1:A>
So announcing today May fourth the new IBM laser printer series
forty thirtynine

<ICE-SIN:S2A-037#11:1:A>
We are announcing four new models today namely the forty
thirty-nine ten R the forty thirty-nine twelve R the forty thirty-nine twelve
L the forty thirty-nine sixteen L

<ICE-SIN:S2A-037#12:1:A>
As you can see on the board the printers speed range from ten pages
per minute sixteen pages per minute

<ICE-SIN:S2A-037#13:1:A>
In other words our printers today are targeted not so much to
low-end but at the medium to the LAN printers range

<ICE-SIN:S2A-037#14:1:A>
Our existing range of laser printers the forty twenty-nine continue
to be current line products

<ICE-SIN:S2A-037#15:1:A>
From the chart you can see that forty twenty-nine which is a
ten-page per minute machine will be positioned slightly below the forty
thirty-nine ten R

<ICE-SIN:S2A-037#16:1:A>
At the lowest end we continue to offer a very low end printer the
forty nineteen E

<ICE-SIN:S2A-037#17:1:A>
What I'm going to cover next in the next two charts is really uh to
present to you some of the things that uh we've discovered from talking to
customers from speaking to our dealers things that we believe you as our
customers find important in our laser printers

<ICE-SIN:S2A-037#18:1:A>
I'm sure that you would recognise that these are the things that
you look for when you're buying a laser printer

<ICE-SIN:S2A-037#19:1:A>
And I guess uh each of these will be more important than the rest
to uh each and the individual one of you print quality ease of operation
compatibility to all the applications that you're running

<ICE-SIN:S2A-037#20:1:A>
Your ability to connect the laser printer that you buy to your
local area network

<ICE-SIN:S2A-037#21:1:A>
You want your printer to support all the protocols that you're
running in your local area network

<ICE-SIN:S2A-037#22:1:A>
And of course you want your printer to be of a reasonable speed if
not fast

<ICE-SIN:S2A-037#23:1:A>
Paper handling I guess uh most of you would be aware I mean uh we
use transparency we use uh all sorts of paper uh text rough texture

<ICE-SIN:S2A-037#24:1:A>
Alright we have thick paper and all sorts alright

<ICE-SIN:S2A-037#25:1:A>
As we speak to the customers we also told that uh hey we buy a
laser printer it cost a few thousand dollars how do you protect my investment

<ICE-SIN:S2A-037#26:1:A>
Customers today are getting more sophisticated

<ICE-SIN:S2A-037#27:1:A>
They are printing more and more sophisticated thing from the laser
printers

<ICE-SIN:S2A-037#28:1:A>
They want to know if they can store fonts or forms in the laser
printers so that the they can have a faster print out without having to down
load the uh the forms or logos from the computer

<ICE-SIN:S2A-037#29:1:A>
Being real image conscious I think a lot of companies support today
the environment friendly movement

<ICE-SIN:S2A-037#30:1:A>
And when you buy a laser printer I I would imagine that you would
choose a product that is environment friendly

<ICE-SIN:S2A-037#31:1:A>
Last but certainly not least especially in a competitive market
like Singapore I think the price performance is certainly a key buying
criteria for most of you

<ICE-SIN:S2A-037#32:1:A>
Having gone through some of these uh features that I would imagine
most of you would look for I think we put together a printer that is what we
call uhm packed with features that are customer driven

<ICE-SIN:S2A-037#33:1:A>
Let us look at what some of these benefits that you can enjoy from
this uh IBM lasers range uh sorry Lexmark IBM printers

<ICE-SIN:S2A-037#34:1:A>
In my discussions with uh a lot of the customers one of the things
that was single out most is compatibility

<ICE-SIN:S2A-037#35:1:A>
When uh one buys a laser printer a customer hey when I bring the
printer back to my company I just want to uh plug the printer on

<ICE-SIN:S2A-037#36:1:A>
I don't to change the drivers

<ICE-SIN:S2A-037#37:1:A>
I don't want to change whatever configurations that I've already
put into my software

<ICE-SIN:S2A-037#38:1:A>
In other words they want to plug the printer and play so to speak

<ICE-SIN:S2A-037#39:1:A>
Alright so the the the IBM forty thrity-nine laser printers today
are designed as we what we term as plug and play

<ICE-SIN:S2A-037#40:1:A>
How do we do this

<ICE-SIN:S2A-037#41:1:A>
The forty thirty-nine printers come standard with the PCL five and
the PostScript uh data screen as standard

<ICE-SIN:S2A-037#42:1:A>
In other words most of you whose applications are running on PCL
five or PostScript will find that you would have no problem with data screen
support

<ICE-SIN:S2A-037#43:1:A>
If you are a Macintosh well we have the apple-top option that you
could easily plug on and then use this highly competitive machines in a
Macintosh environment

<ICE-SIN:S2A-037#44:1:A>
Certainly second on the list must surely be ease of use

<ICE-SIN:S2A-037#45:1:A>
When you buy a laser printer and you put it in your company
different people use it and different people with uh different skill levels

<ICE-SIN:S2A-037#46:1:A>
So you must make sure that the laser printer is easy to use

<ICE-SIN:S2A-037#47:1:A>
So when we ship the printer today we ship it to what we call a
Quick Start set up utility

<ICE-SIN:S2A-037#48:1:A>
What is this

<ICE-SIN:S2A-037#49:1:A>
This is a series of diskettes that we put into the uh box that when
you open it you can uh run this into PC and you realise that these diskettes
contain the popular drivers for the drivers for you popular applications

<ICE-SIN:S2A-037#50:1:A>
It provides you with uh help screens that help you in store your
printers in whatever configuration you want

<ICE-SIN:S2A-037#51:1:A>
And basically the bottom line is to make installation so easy that
you generally do not have to read the manual or call your dealer up to help
you with it

<ICE-SIN:S2A-037#52:1:A>
The forty thirty-nine following the tradition of the forty
twenty-nine where we have had a very intuitive operator panel to make it easy
for the end-users

<ICE-SIN:S2A-037#53:1:A>
The forty thirty-nine comes with a four-line display alright uh

<ICE-SIN:S2A-037#54:1:A>
I can assure you that this operator panel is very easy to use very
intuitive hard for me to stand here and convince you I guess

<ICE-SIN:S2A-037#55:1:A>
But uh what I would encourage you to do is when this session is
over the machines are placed behind

<ICE-SIN:S2A-037#56:1:A>
I would encourage each each of you to look at the machines and try
out the panel for yourself and I'm sure you would agree with me that the
panel is very easy to use

<ICE-SIN:S2A-037#57:1:A>
Having said that you need to plug and play it means that the
printer must be smart enough to know what data stream is coming to it

<ICE-SIN:S2A-037#58:1:A>
So we've packed into the forty thirty-nine what we call the smart
switch

<ICE-SIN:S2A-037#59:1:A>
The smart switch feature will sniff out for you the data stream of
the file that you're that sending to the printer

<ICE-SIN:S2A-037#60:1:A>
In other words if you were if your printer is on PCL 5 font and a
PostScript file is coming on the printer will know it's a PostScript file and
automatically switch to PostScript alright

<ICE-SIN:S2A-037#61:1:A>
So in other words uh no operating complication and no garbage print

<ICE-SIN:S2A-037#62:1:A>
We have have what we call the automatic port sensing alright the
printer comes with standard a serial port a parallel port and ability for you
to hook up a internal network adaptor card

<ICE-SIN:S2A-037#63:1:A>
So in other words for you to print from each of these ports your
printer is smart enough to detect where the signals are coming into which
port and uh having detected which is your active port you must know how to
switch

<ICE-SIN:S2A-037#64:1:A>
So automatic port setting comes standard and that makes it very
easy to use

<ICE-SIN:S2A-037#65:1:A>
Just like the forty thirty twenty-nines the new laser printers have
got the print cartridge in stored when it is shipped so that makes it easy
for you again when you open the box the print cartridge is already in the
printer

<ICE-SIN:S2A-037#66:1:A>
And uh again finally but not the least you have a laser printer
that is small in size light in weight especially if you compare the LAN model
the forty thirty-nine sixteen L when you compare it to some of the uh local
area network printer out in the market

<ICE-SIN:S2A-037#67:1:A>
You would realise that we've got a printer that is of a very small
foot print but yet do the job of being a LAN printer

<ICE-SIN:S2A-037#68:1:A>
Now print quality why would one want to buy a laser printer

<ICE-SIN:S2A-037#69:1:A>
I guess uh first and foremost we want to have excellent print
quality because it affects our image after all

<ICE-SIN:S2A-037#70:1:A>
When we launch the dates fourteen twentynine laser printer we say
it's your image make the most of it

<ICE-SIN:S2A-037#71:1:A>
So the laser printers ability to do a six hundred dot per inch
resolution we have the what we call the print quality enhancement technology

<ICE-SIN:S2A-037#72:1:A>
This is a curve smoothing technology that is now available in the
six hundred dots per inch environment

<ICE-SIN:S2A-037#73:1:A>
In other words you get sharper print than ever

<ICE-SIN:S2A-037#74:1:A>
The laser printers today come with a new technology that Lexmark
has incorporated called the PictureGrade

<ICE-SIN:S2A-037#75:1:A>
This is a image enhancement technology

<ICE-SIN:S2A-037#76:1:A>
Now with this technology it allows the uh Lexmark laser printers to
print up to to print images right with up to one hundred shades of grey

<ICE-SIN:S2A-037#77:1:A>
The number of shades of grey that you can print will directly
affect the print quality of the graphics that you print

<ICE-SIN:S2A-037#78:1:A>
So if you look at some of the printouts that we have that has grey
scaling I'm sure you agree with me that with this latest PictureGrade
enhancement technology we've got printouts that are far superior to what we
have seen

<ICE-SIN:S2A-037#79:1:A>
The next thing that we've done to increase the uhm print quality is
really the superior toner technology

<ICE-SIN:S2A-037#80:1:A>
What this does is to avoid the ghosting image problem

<ICE-SIN:S2A-037#81:1:A>
I understand that ? ? that some of the printers competition
printers out there today do have this problem

<ICE-SIN:S2A-037#82:1:A>
In other words uh when you print a black uh when you print a page
that has a lot of black on it and then you go on to the next page and you uh
hold up the text page against the light you do see some of the ghosting
effect left from the previous page

<ICE-SIN:S2A-037#83:1:A>
Using the superior toner technology Lexmark is able to avoid this
problem

<ICE-SIN:S2A-037#84:1:A>
And I think uh if you compare printouts that has got a lot of
patches of black with the uh Lexmark printers this is superior machine to a
lot of those that are out in the market

<ICE-SIN:S2A-037#85:1:A>
To allow to increase the quality of your printout we give you
fifty-two scalable fonts and we also give you the ability to adjust the
stroke weight of this font

<ICE-SIN:S2A-037#86:1:A>
Having print quality is important but so is having a high having a
machine that prints at a speed that you want

<ICE-SIN:S2A-037#87:1:A>
We have uh move on from the Motorola ? ? uh processes that we use
in the forty twenty-nine to the RISC processes RISC processes as you would
know is faster in calculate in rected?? calculations

<ICE-SIN:S2A-037#88:1:A>
And that gives you a much faster printout especially when you have
complicated uh graphic

<ICE-SIN:S2A-037#89:1:A>
As mention earlier the printers the printers start from ten pages
per minute goes all the way up to sixteen pages per minute

<ICE-SIN:S2A-037#90:1:A>
In order to uh increase print speed we have what we call the
advance memory management system </I>
