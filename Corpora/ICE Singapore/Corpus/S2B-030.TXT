take a look at the latest trends in dining

<ICE-SIN:S2B-030#7:1:A>
Whether dining out at foodcourts or restaurants people are more
health conscious about what they eat but more importantly chefs are making an
effort to create dishes that not only look good and taste great but are
healthy as well

<ICE-SIN:S2B-030#8:1:A>
It's generally acknowledged that much of what we eat is not really
good for us

<ICE-SIN:S2B-030#9:1:A>
Home cooking is the exception

<ICE-SIN:S2B-030#10:1:A>
For health conscious people eating out does not necessarily mean
unappetising or unattractive meals because restaurants' chefs have been
creating nutritious and appealing dishes with fresh natural ingredients herbs
or spices

<ICE-SIN:S2B-030#11:1:A>
So healthy eating can be an enjoyable experience

<ICE-SIN:S2B-030#12:1:A>
It is established that Mediterranean diets reduce the risk of
cancer because of the high consumption of vegetables and olive oil

<ICE-SIN:S2B-030#13:1:A>
Also for those watching their waistlines chef Clayton offers an
alternative to the usual Mediterranean dish

<ICE-SIN:S2B-030#14:1:A>
To help customers with their choice this restaurant even carries
the calorie count on the menu

<ICE-SIN:S2B-030#15:1:A>
For starters try a refreshing mixed fruits salad of rock melon
pineapple star-fruit watermelon kiwi pink grape fruit and crispy lettuce
served with a chilled lemon grass and mint flavoured yogurt sauce

<ICE-SIN:S2B-030#16:1:A>

<ICE-SIN:S2B-030#22:1:A>
This restaurant focuses on light healthier Japanese meals and
concentrates on vegetable and tofu dishes

<ICE-SIN:S2B-030#23:1:A>
The use of <unclear> word </unclear> fish which contain the omega
three factor also helps prevent heart disease

<ICE-SIN:S2B-030#24:1:A>
Spices like the ones used in Indian cuisine contain no fat or
cholesterol and bring out the flavour in foods

<ICE-SIN:S2B-030#25:1:A>
They also have medicinal values

<ICE-SIN:S2B-030#26:1:A>
The belief in cool and heaty foods is intrinsic in Chinese cuisine

<ICE-SIN:S2B-030#27:1:A>
Tonic soups and nutritious dishes with <unclear> word </unclear>
properties are served in this restaurant

<ICE-SIN:S2B-030#28:1:A>
For instance the double boiled fresh water fish with American
ginseng invigorates vital energy for fatigue and the imperial chicken with
eight precious herbs promotes blood circulation and energy

<ICE-SIN:S2B-030#29:1:A>
There is an extensive choice available to diners or the health
conscious and taste and appearance are both important considerations so it's
never a bland experience

<ICE-SIN:S2B-030#30:1:A>
Chefs create an exciting array of flavours so that eating out and
eating healthily becomes a treat not a chore

<ICE-SIN:S2B-030#31:1:A>
It's time for a commercial break but when we come back we visit two
of the top restaurants featured this week the Olea and the Blue Ginger

<ICE-SIN:S2B-030#32:1:A>
The Olea is an authentic Greek restaurant full of rustic charm and
sunny hospitality

<ICE-SIN:S2B-030#33:1:A>
It's also made into the Wine and Dine top restaurants guide for
this year

<ICE-SIN:S2B-030#34:1:A>
Another restaurant that boast authenticity is the Blue Ginger a
local Peranakan restaurant

<ICE-SIN:S2B-030#35:1:A>
Greek food like the language is something that most people in
Singapore know little about

<ICE-SIN:S2B-030#36:1:A>
To get acquainted with authentic Greek fare just troop on down to
the Olea deli and restaurant along Upper East Coast road

<ICE-SIN:S2B-030#37:1:A>
In a Greek <unclear> word </unclear> with rustic charm Greek
ornaments and melodious traditional music

<ICE-SIN:S2B-030#38:1:A>

atmosphere is cozy and inviting

<ICE-SIN:S2B-030#39:1:A>
Al fresco dining is also available

<ICE-SIN:S2B-030#40:1:A>
Let's start with a delectable selection of appetisers

<ICE-SIN:S2B-030#41:1:A>
Try the platter of <unclear> word </unclear> and marinated octopus
with Olea signatured olive bread

<ICE-SIN:S2B-030#42:1:A>
For mains <unclear> word </unclear> is a Greek favourite made of
layers of thinly sliced eggplant and tomato the lasagne-liked creation is
baked with a tomato based <unclear> word </unclear> lamb filling

<ICE-SIN:S2B-030#43:1:A>
Or try the lemon roast chicken with potatoes and the lamb <unclear>
word </unclear> served with <unclear> word </unclear> pasta

<ICE-SIN:S2B-030#44:1:A>
Olea's beverage list showcases several Greek table and desert wines
and spirits

<ICE-SIN:S2B-030#45:1:A>
Start with the <unclear> word </unclear> an <unclear> word
</unclear> Greek national <unclear> word </unclear> and accompany your meal
with a bottle of the famous pine-centred <unclear> word </unclear>

<ICE-SIN:S2B-030#46:1:A>
To round off the meal try the potent Greek coffee or sample a slice
of <unclear> word </unclear> a <unclear> word </unclear> crummy <unclear>
word </unclear> or honey soaked <unclear> word </unclear>

<ICE-SIN:S2B-030#47:1:A>
Making <unclear> word </unclear> is very tedious process over forty
layers of <unclear> word </unclear> pastry has to be painstakingly laid by
hand

<ICE-SIN:S2B-030#48:1:A>
<unclear> word </unclear> aside you can take away deserts cheeses
and other Greek goodies from the restaurant's deli counter

<ICE-SIN:S2B-030#49:1:A>
The Olea an introduction to a life long Greek affair

<ICE-SIN:S2B-030#50:1:A>
Having established a reputation for authentic Peranakan or
<unclear> word </unclear> Chinese cuisine the first restaurant opened in
Tanjong Pagar three years ago

<ICE-SIN:S2B-030#51:1:A>
Diners enjoy Peranakan home-styled cooking in a traditional
Peranakan setting

<ICE-SIN:S2B-030#52:1:A>
The Blue Ginger at the Hereen redefines the same theme in a
minimalist approach

<ICE-SIN:S2B-030#53:1:A>
In both restaurants you will find the whimsical paintings of local
artist Martin Loh

<ICE-SIN:S2B-030#54:1:A>
The menu is the same for both Gingers showcasing <unclear> word
</unclear> Lian's family renditions of traditional Nonya cuisine

<ICE-SIN:S2B-030#55:1:A>
They include the eggplant with samba toufu goreng and ayam pakang
blue ginger a house specialty

<ICE-SIN:S2B-030#56:1:A>
Other house favourites include spicy prawns and otar otar a spice
fish paste in banana leaves and ikan asam <unclear> word </unclear> or fish
in a sweet or spicy gravy and for desert the ever popular chendol

<ICE-SIN:S2B-030#57:1:A>
Peranakan cuisine generally uses ingredients like ginger <unclear>
word </unclear> garlic <unclear> word </unclear> asam <unclear> word
</unclear> and lemon grass and a must for a Pernankan cuisine is the samba
blachan

<ICE-SIN:S2B-030#58:1:A>
When we took our cameras to the kitchen the chefs were preparing
<unclear> word </unclear> or deep fried fillets of mackerel topped with a
chili paste

<ICE-SIN:S2B-030#59:1:A>
If you can tear your attention away from the mouth watering dishes
for a moment you will notice that the restaurant is decorated with
traditional Peranakan lamps and mirrors

<ICE-SIN:S2B-030#60:1:A>
The cozy ambience and authentic Peranakan food make Blue Ginger one
of Wine and Dine's choices of top restaurants in Singapore

<ICE-SIN:S2B-030#61:1:A>
We'll visit several more top restaurants in Singapore next week

<ICE-SIN:S2B-030#62:1:A>

restaurants guide available at all bookstores

We will take a break but when we come back we sample the exotic
flavours of Africa

<ICE-SIN:S2B-030#65:1:A>
<O> commercial break </O>

<ICE-SIN:S2B-030#66:1:A>
Hi I'm Ai Lin and welcome back to Wine and Dine the guide to the
best in food and wine in Singapore and in Asia

<ICE-SIN:S2B-030#67:1:A>
Africa and Singapore might be oceans apart but the exotic flavours
of Africa are now available on this sunny island

<ICE-SIN:S2B-030#68:1:A>
We find out why a Singaporean found the need to bring those
flavours here </I>

<ICE-SIN:S2B-030#69:2:B>
New York July nineteen ninety-two

<ICE-SIN:S2B-030#70:2:B>
With the statue of liberty as backdrop the United States celebrated
the five hundredth anniversary of Christopher Columbus' dicovery of the new
world

<ICE-SIN:S2B-030#71:2:B>
There is a theory based on archaeological findings that the ancient
Chinese has set foot on American soil hundred of years before the famous
European explorer

<ICE-SIN:S2B-030#72:2:B>
But even if proven true it is likely to be only an academic point

<ICE-SIN:S2B-030#73:2:B>
With a grand multi-national sail pass complete with replicas of
Columbus' ships eloquent speeches were made about the pursuit of liberty and
happiness

<ICE-SIN:S2B-030#74:2:B>
America congratulated herself for being a land of opportunities

<ICE-SIN:S2B-030#75:2:B>
Indeed that was what drew a flood tide of people from the European
continents since the last century

<ICE-SIN:S2B-030#76:2:B>
And it was here at Alice island that they first tasted the air of
freedom and promise

<ICE-SIN:S2B-030#77:2:B>
Now a museum the landmark building on the island was the point of
immigration for thousands who like Columbus took the voyage across the
Atlantic ocean

<ICE-SIN:S2B-030#78:2:B>
Today Alice island remains a symbol of hope the starting point in
the journey towards the American dream but not for the Chinese

<ICE-SIN:S2B-030#79:2:B>
On the Western edge of the continent where the Pacific ocean rushes
to meet the shore are two other islands

<ICE-SIN:S2B-030#80:2:B>
One if Alcatraz the fortress prison that used to be home for the
most hardened criminals an island Americans are so familiar with

<ICE-SIN:S2B-030#81:2:B>
Not too far away and not very well-known is Angel island which was
for the Chinese immigrants a nightmarish perverse cross between Alice and
Alcatraz

<ICE-SIN:S2B-030#82:2:B>
Angel island was the result of the exclusion act of eighteen
eighty-two

<ICE-SIN:S2B-030#83:2:B>
Its sole purpose was to keep the Chinese and only them out of the
United States

<ICE-SIN:S2B-030#84:2:B>
Charged with causing unemployment and for being heathens America's
doors were to remain shut to the Chinese for over fifty years

<ICE-SIN:S2B-030#85:2:B>
You don't find too many laundries in San Franciso's Chinatown today

<ICE-SIN:S2B-030#86:2:B>
Perhaps it's because few want the job which for so long has been
associated with a second class status

<ICE-SIN:S2B-030#87:2:B>
But in the long years of discrimination it was one of the few
occupations opened to the Chinese

<ICE-SIN:S2B-030#88:2:B>
Although the Chinese are not longer confined to working just within
Chinatown there are many who would still argue that discrimination persists

<ICE-SIN:S2B-030#89:2:B>
Alfred Lee Director of the New York Chinatown Senior Citizens'
Association is one of them

<ICE-SIN:S2B-030#90:2:B>
He and others here are preparing for a demonstration against the
Federal government

<ICE-SIN:S2B-030#91:2:B>
The point of contention is the allocation of jobs and contracts to
Chinese in a multi-million housing project in the Chinatown area

<ICE-SIN:S2B-030#92:2:B>
Further demonstration had to be called understores for those who
have been left out the fact that America land of opportunities dishes out
opportunities selectively

<ICE-SIN:S2B-030#93:2:B>
Blatant discrimination may be gone but many charge that its subtle
offsprings like the glass ceiling continue to frustrate Chinese American
professionals in their attempt to move up the managerial ladder

<ICE-SIN:S2B-030#94:2:B>
Doctor David Lam would have been one of them had he not struck out
on his own to set up a computer company in California Silicon Valley

<ICE-SIN:S2B-030#95:2:B>
In days past it was the stereotyping of Chinese that fed
discrimination

<ICE-SIN:S2B-030#96:2:B>
In the nineties such stereotyping has taken an ironic twist

<ICE-SIN:S2B-030#97:2:B>
Berkely University California the Asian presence mainly Chinese is
unmistakable

<ICE-SIN:S2B-030#98:2:B>
America is calling the Chinese the model minority and often the
disproportionately high number of Chinese undergraduates in campuses like
Berkely seem to support that tag

<ICE-SIN:S2B-030#99:2:B>
But the model minority label may be working against the Chinese
today as much as negatives stereotypes in the past had done so

<ICE-SIN:S2B-030#100:2:B>
That misconception is not just confined to students and academic
performance

<ICE-SIN:S2B-030#101:2:B>
Professor Tian Chan Lim Chancellor of Berkely University

<ICE-SIN:S2B-030#102:2:B>
Entertaining and amusing is this young black American's approach
to earning a living

<ICE-SIN:S2B-030#103:2:B>
May seem his lot and that of others like him is what white America
is more aware about

<ICE-SIN:S2B-030#104:2:B>
Few Chinese even those desperately poor would do this and that
perhaps is why their problems are never noticed

<ICE-SIN:S2B-030#105:2:B>
The nineteen ninety census report for the US indicate that
eighteen per cent of Chinese live below the poverty line higher than the
fifteen per cent national average

<ICE-SIN:S2B-030#106:2:B>
And it is in the old tenements of Chinatowns that they can be
found

<ICE-SIN:S2B-030#107:2:B>
The Fongs came to San Franciso from Canton about a year ago

<ICE-SIN:S2B-030#108:2:B>
The family of four has been living in this tiny room since they
arrived

<ICE-SIN:S2B-030#109:2:B>
It takes just two beds to cover almost all the floor space yet
rent is US three hundred dollars a month

<ICE-SIN:S2B-030#110:2:B>
The Fongs are just scrapping by with the help of a relative who
isn't very much better off himself

<ICE-SIN:S2B-030#111:2:B>
The tendency to forget about people like the Fongs and to focus
only on successful Chinese is something which is uncomfortable and worrying
even for those who have scaled to the very top

<ICE-SIN:S2B-030#112:2:B>
Despite the promise of freedom and welcome America has yet to
fully accept the Chinese <X>

<ICE-SIN:S2B-030#X113:2:B>
That is exactly what many Chinese in America fear the jealousy
prejudice and animosity that had led time and again to physical attacks from
the days of the very first Chinese immigrants It may not be mentioned so much
today but the memory of one such attack on a young man named Vincent Chin is
deeply edged in the minds of many Chinese Americans It's still an uphill task
for ethnic Chinese in North America to gain acceptance but the onus is not
just on white people Charles Pei Hwa served as a member of the civil rights
commission under former US President George Bush He believes that to be
accepted by main-stream society Chinese Americans must first take the
initiative to redress a major short-coming the tendency to be parochial in
their outlook But is that sentiment shared by most Chinese those busy making
a living? Across North America shops in Chinatowns do brisk business and the
streets bustle with life The influx of new immigrants from Asia has
contributed to that But it has also caused some resentment among those who
still see Chinese as outsiders But the recently arrived who make up the bulk
of the Chinese population in North America don't seem to be too bothered with
that Many prefer literally to mine only their own business Most of the newly
arrived did not go through the harsh years of discrimination The toughest
part in the road to acceptance had already been crossed And the days of being
outcasts have faded in the distance But the journey is by no means over The
challenge for the Chinese in North America is to break away from being
outsiders To integrate into their adopted countries and that may even be just
as long a stretch to cover </X> </I>
