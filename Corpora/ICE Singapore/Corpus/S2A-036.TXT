<I>

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-036#1:1:A>
A little bit more of myself yah

<ICE-SIN:S2A-036#2:1:A>
So yah this proves you all that I know what I am talking about

<ICE-SIN:S2A-036#3:1:A>
Uhm basically a newspaper is a eighteen hour operation everyday

<ICE-SIN:S2A-036#4:1:A>
So uhm you can't expect one person to work the whole eighteen hours
and that's why I'm called the night news editor

<ICE-SIN:S2A-036#5:1:A>
Because there's a transition period uhm from between two and four
o'clock every evening when someone takes over the day day editor's work

<ICE-SIN:S2A-036#6:1:A>
And that's when I come in and probably stay through till about
twelve every night to get the pages and stories out

<ICE-SIN:S2A-036#7:1:A>
Okay reason why I pick the Newmen's English is that I notice uh many
people like you and uh got flair for the language skills good command good
command of it

<ICE-SIN:S2A-036#8:1:A>
But uh when you come into a newsroom situation uhm you find it a
little difficult to adapt to what a newspaper demands

<ICE-SIN:S2A-036#9:1:A>
A newspaper demands something that's totally different from writing
your novels your poems and what have you

<ICE-SIN:S2A-036#10:1:A>
And I notice that there's been a normally it takes students between
two to three months before they get the hang of writing for a newspaper

<ICE-SIN:S2A-036#11:1:A>
So I thought I pick this and just let you all know what it takes
and uh give you an idea of the skill that uhm writing for a newspaper
requires

<ICE-SIN:S2A-036#12:1:A>
And uh don't bother taking down notes because I've made a whole set
of uhm notes knowing uh how fastidious uh students at the moment are in
taking notes

<ICE-SIN:S2A-036#13:1:A>
So I made a whole set and I'll distribute them to you later okay

<ICE-SIN:S2A-036#14:1:A>
Now I also got few uhm two exercises and depending on time we'll do
either one or both of them later on

<ICE-SIN:S2A-036#15:1:A>
They just just to give give you a feel of what what it is

<ICE-SIN:S2A-036#16:1:A>
Okay Newmens's English

<ICE-SIN:S2A-036#17:1:A>
Now this will give you an overview of what it means

<ICE-SIN:S2A-036#18:1:A>
This was uhm from a famous book by Harold Evans who wrote a series
of Harold Evans is the former editor of the London Times and the Sunday Times
okay

<ICE-SIN:S2A-036#19:1:A>
Now he came across this sign and he thought to himself that's just
three words too much and basically what what we do as newspaper man is keep
it as short and simple as possible

<ICE-SIN:S2A-036#20:1:A>
So uhm going to this sold fish

<ICE-SIN:S2A-036#21:1:A>
You don't need to see fresh say fresh because uhm like he says
there he no one will sell tell you that they're selling stale fish to you

<ICE-SIN:S2A-036#22:1:A>
They don't have to say sold because you're not gonna <unclear> word
</unclear> give that away and you don't have to say here because you would'nt
be doing it at home would you

<ICE-SIN:S2A-036#23:1:A>
Okay so basically what we all need here is just fish right

<ICE-SIN:S2A-036#24:1:A>
That's that's the essence of uh writing for newspaper

<ICE-SIN:S2A-036#25:1:A>
Keep that as short and simple as possible

<ICE-SIN:S2A-036#26:1:A>
First of all because your reader is not gonna have a lot of time
for you

<ICE-SIN:S2A-036#27:1:A>
On average a a newspaper reader spend between fifteen and twenty
minutes reading them which means you got that's not hardly enough even for
the ads

<ICE-SIN:S2A-036#28:1:A>
Okay do you want to read a paper from cover to cover it takes you
at least three hours

<ICE-SIN:S2A-036#29:1:A>
And most people don't have that kind of time

<ICE-SIN:S2A-036#30:1:A>
They take twenty minutes every day just grasp at the headlines and
and and basically just have an idea of what the newspaper is saying

<ICE-SIN:S2A-036#31:1:A>
And also because the the newpaper has to complete with other things
like TV you see

<ICE-SIN:S2A-036#32:1:A>
It's much easier to turn on the TV and watch CNN or SBC news or BBC
news and just not think

<ICE-SIN:S2A-036#33:1:A>
Reading requires some effort okay so that's what we do basically

<ICE-SIN:S2A-036#34:1:A>
Okay from time to time I'll put up some quotations on on the
subject on famous journalist writers and uh editors because just to uh spice
things up a little

<ICE-SIN:S2A-036#35:1:A>
Okay I think a lot of people are concern about the style of writing
you know

<ICE-SIN:S2A-036#36:1:A>
You want to be colourful you want to do this you want to do that
and you forget that you know you're not writing for yourselves you're writing
for your reader

<ICE-SIN:S2A-036#37:1:A>
So basically have something to say and say it clearly

<ICE-SIN:S2A-036#38:1:A>
That means most of the time using the most simple words available
so that is the core skill of journalism your your language

<ICE-SIN:S2A-036#39:1:A>
You need to have that kind of language not not five syllable word
not seven syllable words one two syllable words keep it simple

<ICE-SIN:S2A-036#40:1:A>
Of course that varies from newpaper to newpaper

<ICE-SIN:S2A-036#41:1:A>
The Newpaper for instance has a totally different style from the
from the Straits Times okay

<ICE-SIN:S2A-036#42:1:A>
Because the Newpaper generally pitch at a younger audience who are
you know grammar maybe it's not what it should be or or even hasn't gotten
there yet

<ICE-SIN:S2A-036#43:1:A>
And on the other hand Business Times is pitch at much higher
audience than the Straits Times

<ICE-SIN:S2A-036#44:1:A>
So they use or verbose language

<ICE-SIN:S2A-036#45:1:A>
Okay what does good news writing requires

<ICE-SIN:S2A-036#46:1:A>
Language is specific conferring and concise sentences which are
clear at first glance

<ICE-SIN:S2A-036#47:1:A>
If someone has to read a sentence twice then you've already lost
him or her okay

<ICE-SIN:S2A-036#48:1:A>
Preference for sentences in the active voice basically telling
stories so you need to communicate clearly to the reader

<ICE-SIN:S2A-036#49:1:A>
No one wants to see the what past tense and you know things like
that that just make it boring for everybody else

<ICE-SIN:S2A-036#50:1:A>
And assertive sentences I've given two examples here

<ICE-SIN:S2A-036#51:1:A>
Don't say the project was not successful just say it was a failure
okay

<ICE-SIN:S2A-036#52:1:A>
Can can everybody see from the back

<ICE-SIN:S2A-036#53:1:A>
Now a lot of people have the preference for this kind of thing
especially uh uhm public relations officers and uh civil servants

<ICE-SIN:S2A-036#54:1:A>
They think that the more words you use the the better it comes
across

<ICE-SIN:S2A-036#55:1:A>
And it it can be more authoritative if you read a a sentence that
says the project was not successful

<ICE-SIN:S2A-036#56:1:A>
And you tend to get a a feeling that the writer is trying to say
something important right because you're using you're using more words

<ICE-SIN:S2A-036#57:1:A>
But for a newspaper just keep it simple

<ICE-SIN:S2A-036#58:1:A>
Just say the project failed

<ICE-SIN:S2A-036#59:1:A>
Yah every every word has to add something to a sentence so you just
it's basically economy of the language

<ICE-SIN:S2A-036#60:1:A>
We we don't want yah we call a spade a spade why call it the factor
of production

<ICE-SIN:S2A-036#61:1:A>
First of all you'll have your average reader wondering what you're
talking about and secondly yah uses two more words than just saying a spade

<ICE-SIN:S2A-036#62:1:A>
An abstraction should be preceded by a particle now the the the
newsmen's uh aim is basically to simplify everything for his reader

<ICE-SIN:S2A-036#63:1:A>
So don't say that so and so brought a piece of property which is
twenty hectares like a large for twenty millions dollars

<ICE-SIN:S2A-036#64:1:A>
That doesn't mean anything okay so that's why we always if we
notice if we we read our stories we talk about land or something we always
have something like football field if twenty hectares

<ICE-SIN:S2A-036#65:1:A>
How many football fields is that fifteen you know

<ICE-SIN:S2A-036#66:1:A>
Straight away you have an idea of what fifteen how big fifteen
football fields are rather than twenty hectares which can be as big as this
room or you know even smaller no one

<ICE-SIN:S2A-036#67:1:A>
I mean that's just makes your reader think and you and you don't
want to him you know competing between a dictionary and the story that you've
written

<ICE-SIN:S2A-036#68:1:A>
So try to make it as close as to TV as possible if you want to put
it that way

<ICE-SIN:S2A-036#69:1:A>
And this is the big problem use editors to define not daunt many
people have uh

<ICE-SIN:S2A-036#70:1:A>
I've got some examples later you know news editors like they were
going out of style meaning meaningless modifiers that's what that's basically
the same thing

<ICE-SIN:S2A-036#71:1:A>
Watch for meaning you'll to say it clearly and precisely because
you want to tell your reader what exactly you're you're saying rather than
again had him go and figure out whether you know is he talking about this or
is he talking about something else

<ICE-SIN:S2A-036#72:1:A>
So that's that's where precise language comes in

<ICE-SIN:S2A-036#73:1:A>
Avoid cliches I think you see them all the time in our sports pages
and things like that

<ICE-SIN:S2A-036#74:1:A>
So maybe the message hasn't gotten through yet

<ICE-SIN:S2A-036#75:1:A>
Okay once is enough twice is re <unclear> word </unclear> three
time is a felony

<ICE-SIN:S2A-036#76:1:A>
Use uhm terms sparingly don't don't use the same thing over and
over again until it becomes boring staccato to the reader okay

<ICE-SIN:S2A-036#77:1:A>
Here are some example to what I'm talking about I think they speak
for themselves lah

<ICE-SIN:S2A-036#78:1:A>
Every word must add to a sentence

<ICE-SIN:S2A-036#79:1:A>
You would have everybody running for a dictionary and wondering
what exactly he meant uhm same goes on

<ICE-SIN:S2A-036#80:1:A>
The adjectives favourites of uh many of our interns students who
come and work for us during the holidays and things like that they like to do
things like that split second of eerie silence the thunderous roars

<ICE-SIN:S2A-036#81:1:A>
Okay roars are always thunderous if they weren't they weren't
couldn't be called roars yah

<ICE-SIN:S2A-036#82:1:A>
Yah modifiers rather unique you know people will always like to say
Oh he's rather nice

<ICE-SIN:S2A-036#83:1:A>
She's rather pretty

<ICE-SIN:S2A-036#84:1:A>
The lecture was rather unique

<ICE-SIN:S2A-036#85:1:A>
It's either unique or it isn't

<ICE-SIN:S2A-036#86:1:A>
And that's there's another example

<ICE-SIN:S2A-036#87:1:A>
Someone scald scalded by hot water

<ICE-SIN:S2A-036#88:1:A>
If it was cold water you wouldn't have been scalded

<ICE-SIN:S2A-036#89:1:A>
And there's some examples of cliches at the bottom

<ICE-SIN:S2A-036#90:1:A>
So that basically is uh the language that you that people want to
write for newspaper or write for newspaper should use

<ICE-SIN:S2A-036#91:1:A>
Now I go on to news stories and uh how how they should written and
okay I give you about five minutes to read the first paragraph to see if you
can figure it out

<ICE-SIN:S2A-036#92:1:A>
Okay one of the good example is the bottom one

<ICE-SIN:S2A-036#93:1:A>
The top one is uh totally <unclear> word </unclear>

<ICE-SIN:S2A-036#94:1:A>
Charles Dicken's example uh by the time you get to the fifth word
you're already saying oh forget it

<ICE-SIN:S2A-036#95:1:A>
I'm not I'm not going to bother with the rest of it

<ICE-SIN:S2A-036#96:1:A>
The other one on the other hand fifteen words and tells you the
whole story right

<ICE-SIN:S2A-036#97:1:A>
So introductions are the first one or two paragraphs that tell you
new stories

<ICE-SIN:S2A-036#98:1:A>
We call them intros for short

<ICE-SIN:S2A-036#99:1:A>
American newspapers call them leads

<ICE-SIN:S2A-036#100:1:A>
We're more towards the British style so we call them intros right

<ICE-SIN:S2A-036#101:1:A>
The first two paragraphs of every story is the most important part
of the story

<ICE-SIN:S2A-036#102:1:A>
Now you have to use your intro to grab the reader

<ICE-SIN:S2A-036#103:1:A>
If a reader looks at your intro and says this is boring he is not
going to read the rest of the story okay

<ICE-SIN:S2A-036#104:1:A>
I think they carry out surveys on various US newspapers and and
the average uh time a reader spends on each uh story is he reads up to the
fifth or sixth paragraph and then that's it unless he's really very
interested in

<ICE-SIN:S2A-036#105:1:A>
So you have to get him interested in right from the start

<ICE-SIN:S2A-036#106:1:A>
And that's what intros are suppose to do

<ICE-SIN:S2A-036#107:1:A>
And this is what it should be short to the point and generally
thirty words is the accepted maximum

<ICE-SIN:S2A-036#108:1:A>
You read Straits Times although sometimes you you you see a bit
more for maybe political stories which require more explanation and but
generally use thirty words alright

<ICE-SIN:S2A-036#109:1:A>
Of course the other extreme is using too few words like in this
example here

<ICE-SIN:S2A-036#110:1:A>
A man died yesterday

<ICE-SIN:S2A-036#111:1:A>
Well sure but how

<ICE-SIN:S2A-036#112:1:A>
And a man died yesterday is not half the exciting as talking

<ICE-SIN:S2A-036#113:1:A>
You see there's detail and she will come to later

<ICE-SIN:S2A-036#114:1:A>
So that's another part of the language that that uhm we have to
use carefully

<ICE-SIN:S2A-036#115:1:A>
Of course if we have to read an intro once I think I said this
before if you have to read it more than once and still can't digest the
meaning it has fail really

<ICE-SIN:S2A-036#116:1:A>
What intro shouldn't have is questions

<ICE-SIN:S2A-036#117:1:A>
Never ask your reader a question because it's most of them can't
answer it anyway </I>
