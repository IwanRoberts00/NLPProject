Last year American perceptions of unfair trade led to this

<ICE-SIN:S2B-039#2:1:A>
Now American frustration over trade is being expressed in the tough
talk of the President

<ICE-SIN:S2B-039#3:1:A>
The crux of the problem the American trade deficit which skyrocketed
to eight-four billion US dollars last year

<ICE-SIN:S2B-039#4:1:A>
More than half came from Japan and it seems it's going to get even
bigger this year

<ICE-SIN:S2B-039#5:1:A>
China is next with the US incurring a huge deficit of eighteen
billion dollars

<ICE-SIN:S2B-039#6:1:A>
With these grim statistics Washington has begun to embrace a more
protectionist policy on the grounds of fair trade

<ICE-SIN:S2B-039#7:1:A>
Already the US has imposed a one hundred and nine per cent tariff on
seventeen steel exporting countries

<ICE-SIN:S2B-039#8:1:A>
Then curbs on European argiculture products and the warning to Japan
to increase semi-conductor imports

<ICE-SIN:S2B-039#9:1:A>
Despite this Washington is seeking to revive the much feared super
three O one act which allows the President to retaliate against unfair
traders and threaten them with higher tariffs import quotas or sanctions

<ICE-SIN:S2B-039#10:1:A>
But even with American threats demands for more market access may
face stiff resistance from the Asia-Pacific

<ICE-SIN:S2B-039#11:1:A>
Most specific economies are geared for export growth where there is
little reliance on the domestic market

<ICE-SIN:S2B-039#12:1:A>
When pressed by the Americans to open up further specific
governments will be reluctant because it would require radical changes at
home

<ICE-SIN:S2B-039#13:1:A>
The high rate of savings will have to be brought down and
consumption encouraged

<ICE-SIN:S2B-039#14:1:A>
More importantly politic interests are tied to economic interests

<ICE-SIN:S2B-039#15:1:A>
The LDP government in Japan is reluctant to allow greater access to
US exports because it would threaten domestic industries like rice and
agriculture a sector which the LDP depends on heavily during elections

<ICE-SIN:S2B-039#16:1:A>
If it accedes to US demands the ruling government risks serious
political damage

<ICE-SIN:S2B-039#17:1:A>
With anti-American sentiment already prevailing a hard line US
stand may spark a back clash from its trading partners

<ICE-SIN:S2B-039#18:1:A>
Another problem involves China

<ICE-SIN:S2B-039#19:1:A>
The US has demanded that China clear up its human rights record and
its arms export before its MFN status comes under review

<ICE-SIN:S2B-039#20:1:A>
With an economic recovery on the cards the Americans should be
mindful of taking too harsh a stance

<ICE-SIN:S2B-039#21:1:A>
Despite the present problems Asia is the fastest growing region in
the world still represents a bountiful market for US exports

<ICE-SIN:S2B-039#22:1:A>
So despite the tough talk President Clinton may need to rewrite his
trade policy to take into account the realities of his time </I>

Hi I'm Lisa Ang and you are watching Hey Singapore

<ICE-SIN:S2B-039#24:2:B>
Now I bet you didn't know that the King Prawn D24 and the Golden
Pillow are names for different types of durians

<ICE-SIN:S2B-039#25:2:B>
Well many of us believe that the durian is the king of all fruits
but for some this thorny friend is considered the smell from hell

<ICE-SIN:S2B-039#26:2:B>
Well like it or not the durian is Singapore's top selling fruit

<ICE-SIN:S2B-039#27:2:B>
And while we may be one of the smallest nations in the world we are
in fact the largest importer of durians

<ICE-SIN:S2B-039#28:2:B>
So if you are a durian lover like me this episode is for you cos'
tonight we are taking you around the island for the perfect durian

<ICE-SIN:S2B-039#29:2:B>
It wasn't difficult at all to figure out where to begin our hunt

<ICE-SIN:S2B-039#30:2:B>
We headed straight to Singapore's durian zone

<ICE-SIN:S2B-039#31:2:B>
If you thought that this famous area is simply a food's paradise or
red light district think again

<ICE-SIN:S2B-039#32:2:B>
Just take a walk down the main road and you will see stall after
colourful stall selling almost nothing but durians

<ICE-SIN:S2B-039#33:2:B>
With so much to look at we were spoiled for choice

<ICE-SIN:S2B-039#34:2:B>
Geylang the best place to buy durians

<ICE-SIN:S2B-039#35:2:B>
If you come here at night you will see many colourful stalls
selling either Thai or Malaysian durians

<ICE-SIN:S2B-039#36:2:B>
And during the durian season in July and August there will be many
cars jammed up back to back on this street

<ICE-SIN:S2B-039#37:2:B>
All here for one purpose only to satisfy their craving for durian

<ICE-SIN:S2B-039#38:2:B>
So I guess this is the perfect place to start our search for the
perfect durian

<ICE-SIN:S2B-039#39:2:B>
There are no hard and fast rules for picking out a good durian

<ICE-SIN:S2B-039#40:2:B>
Everyone has their own theory

<ICE-SIN:S2B-039#41:2:B>
It's said that the pungent the durian's aroma the better it's
supposed to be

<ICE-SIN:S2B-039#42:2:B>
So many buyers subject each fruit to a sniffing test

<ICE-SIN:S2B-039#43:2:B>
Others take into consideration the size and shape of the durian as
well

<ICE-SIN:S2B-039#44:2:B>
Some vendors allow their customers to open up their durians

<ICE-SIN:S2B-039#45:2:B>
Its contents are then judged by the colour and thickness of flesh

<ICE-SIN:S2B-039#46:2:B>
Be warn though you probably end up paying for the opened product

<ICE-SIN:S2B-039#47:2:B>
Ultimately the only real way of telling how good any durian taste
is by taking a bite

<ICE-SIN:S2B-039#48:2:B>
Feasting on durians is not merely a Singaporean passion

<ICE-SIN:S2B-039#49:2:B>
It is considered to be a social activity of sort

<ICE-SIN:S2B-039#50:2:B>
While we were out on location, we saw groups of families and
friends enjoying a durian outing together

<ICE-SIN:S2B-039#51:2:B>
For these people the unlimited supply of durians here beats eating
them at home anytime

<ICE-SIN:S2B-039#52:2:B>
Here is a tip for all durian novices out there

<ICE-SIN:S2B-039#53:2:B>
The pick of the crop normally hangs above the stall and can cost up
to twenty dollars per fruit

<ICE-SIN:S2B-039#54:2:B>
We approach one of the durian seller to find out more

<ICE-SIN:S2B-039#55:2:B>
What exactly does each grade of durian taste like

<ICE-SIN:S2B-039#56:2:B>
It was time to find out

<ICE-SIN:S2B-039#57:2:B>
Right now I have four different grades of Malaysian durians in
front of me starting with D2 D7 D24 and D101

<ICE-SIN:S2B-039#58:2:B>
Now I'm going to open them up because apparently each different
grade has a different colour or flesh

<ICE-SIN:S2B-039#59:2:B>
I couldn't tell the durians apart by just simply looking at the
colour

<ICE-SIN:S2B-039#60:2:B>
Looks like it will take an expert to tell the difference

<ICE-SIN:S2B-039#61:2:B>
However there are durians out there which have a unique colour like
the King Prawn which we will see later

<ICE-SIN:S2B-039#62:2:B>
Okay I've been certified the durian taster in this show

<ICE-SIN:S2B-039#63:2:B>
So let's start with D2

<ICE-SIN:S2B-039#64:2:B>
Uhm okay

<ICE-SIN:S2B-039#65:2:B>
D2 is pretty good

<ICE-SIN:S2B-039#66:2:B>
Let's try D7

<ICE-SIN:S2B-039#67:2:B>
The D7 is a bit bitter that is what I like

<ICE-SIN:S2B-039#68:2:B>
D24 uhm

<ICE-SIN:S2B-039#69:2:B>
D24 has a bit of bitter taste bitter sweet and now for the D101

<ICE-SIN:S2B-039#70:2:B>
Oh my I know why they called this the 101

<ICE-SIN:S2B-039#71:2:B>
I know why they called this the sultan

<ICE-SIN:S2B-039#72:2:B>
It's the royalty of durians

<ICE-SIN:S2B-039#73:2:B>
There are basically two types of durians

<ICE-SIN:S2B-039#74:2:B>
Thai durians and Malaysian durians

<ICE-SIN:S2B-039#75:2:B>
Some people especially tourists like Thai durians but locals like
me prefer Malaysian durians because of its richer taste and aroma

<ICE-SIN:S2B-039#76:2:B>
So which is the best

<ICE-SIN:S2B-039#77:2:B>
Let's find out

<ICE-SIN:S2B-039#78:2:B>
It's easy to tell which country your durians come from

<ICE-SIN:S2B-039#79:2:B>
Malaysia varieties go by numbers while those from Thailand have
exotic names

<ICE-SIN:S2B-039#80:2:B>
We won't go any further into the mysteries of durian cultivation as
long as I know where the best are

<ICE-SIN:S2B-039#81:2:B>
That's all that really matters to me

<ICE-SIN:S2B-039#82:2:B>
A short while later we powered our way down Johore where we went
looking for the State's most famous durian stall

<ICE-SIN:S2B-039#83:2:B>
The attraction here is one of the durian's kingdom superstars the
King Prawn

<ICE-SIN:S2B-039#84:2:B>
You can't possibly mistake its unique deep orangy colour and smooth
texture

<ICE-SIN:S2B-039#85:2:B>
It tasted sweet yet very tangy and it's easy to see why
Singaporeans flock here to eat it

<ICE-SIN:S2B-039#86:2:B>
This is the nearest place to get the King Prawn which is grown
mainly in Penang and since we were able to eat for all we could for 30
ringgit you can believe we cleaned out the place

<ICE-SIN:S2B-039#87:2:B>
Well it seems there aren't any durian plantations in Singapore but
did you know there are is in fact pockets of durian growths left in obscure
places in Singapore

<ICE-SIN:S2B-039#88:2:B>
Apparently people still make a hobby out of picking this fruit

<ICE-SIN:S2B-039#89:2:B>
This area in Upper Thomson may look deserted to you but it's
actually a hot spot for picking up wild durians

<ICE-SIN:S2B-039#90:2:B>
Our durian seller Mr Chua comes here often when he is free not so
much for the booty itself but for the thrill of the hunt

<ICE-SIN:S2B-039#91:2:B>
No matter what his reason might be the attraction was clear

<ICE-SIN:S2B-039#92:2:B>
Looking up into the forest canopy we saw many clusters of yummy
durians

<ICE-SIN:S2B-039#93:2:B>
All almost ripe enough to eat

<ICE-SIN:S2B-039#94:2:B>
You also would be tempted to hang around waiting for all to drop

<ICE-SIN:S2B-039#95:2:B>
Durian hunters in Singapore never harvest the fruit directly from
the trees

<ICE-SIN:S2B-039#96:2:B>
Instead they hunt among the bushes for fallen fruit which wouldn't
be ripe otherwise

<ICE-SIN:S2B-039#97:2:B>
Unlike wild durians the ones you buy at stalls everywhere have
different grades and you can expect those grouped together to taste the same

<ICE-SIN:S2B-039#98:2:B>
However biting into the flesh of a wild durian is always an
adventure

<ICE-SIN:S2B-039#99:2:B>
You would never know whether it would be sweet or bitter like I
found out first hand

<ICE-SIN:S2B-039#100:2:B>
Once our impromptu feast was over it was time to prepare for some
real action and that only happens after sunset

<ICE-SIN:S2B-039#101:2:B>
They came armed with torch-lights

<ICE-SIN:S2B-039#102:2:B>
These durian enthusiasts were willing to wait as long as it takes
for one durian to drop

<ICE-SIN:S2B-039#103:2:B>
Most of them were camera shy but we finally found a durian lover
willing to share his experiences with us

<ICE-SIN:S2B-039#104:2:B>
All right we tried Thai durians Malaysian durians and now our very
own local durians

<ICE-SIN:S2B-039#105:2:B>
What else is there left to sample

<ICE-SIN:S2B-039#106:2:B>
Well for one thing people of this region love durian so much that
they practically use the fruit to make all kinds of desserts

<ICE-SIN:S2B-039#107:2:B>
From durian crepe to durian pudding to durian ice-kacang

<ICE-SIN:S2B-039#108:2:B>
Now talking about it just makes my mouth waters

<ICE-SIN:S2B-039#109:2:B>
Let's dig in

<ICE-SIN:S2B-039#110:2:B>
It's amazing just how many desserts can be made out of durians

<ICE-SIN:S2B-039#111:2:B>
The Hey Singapore team found more than 50 over durian recipes in
the course of our research

<ICE-SIN:S2B-039#112:2:B>
Some were a fusion of East and West like the durian crepe I tried

<ICE-SIN:S2B-039#113:2:B>
Okay the durian crepe tasted so good that I have to bribe the
assistant cook here Swee Lin for the secret recipe

<ICE-SIN:S2B-039#114:2:B>
All right so what are these ingredients Swee Lin

<ICE-SIN:S2B-039#115:2:B>
You would need whipped cream durian flesh and syrup

<ICE-SIN:S2B-039#116:2:B>
Add a generous helping of each into a large bowl and stir
vigorously

<ICE-SIN:S2B-039#117:2:B>
Spread the mixture on a crepe but be careful and fold it till it
is shaped like a wedge

<ICE-SIN:S2B-039#118:2:B>
Next add some garnishing

<ICE-SIN:S2B-039#119:2:B>
In this case we recommend kiwis and strawberries

<ICE-SIN:S2B-039#120:2:B>
Top it all off with a <unclear> word </unclear> of durian
ice-cream whipped cream and durian syrup for a truly sinful treat

<ICE-SIN:S2B-039#121:2:B>
This delicious dessert is yet another example of the spiky fruit's
versatility

<ICE-SIN:S2B-039#122:2:B>
Whether eaten on its own or part of a dessert it's obvious that
Singaporeans can't get enough of durians

<ICE-SIN:S2B-039#123:2:B>
Last year alone over 17 million dollars worth of durians was
imported by Singapore making us the world's biggest durian consumer market

<ICE-SIN:S2B-039#124:3:C>
School's in again but for these final year students at Pei
Chai Secondary it's not a lesson on biology

<ICE-SIN:S2B-039#125:3:C>
What's going on is a lesson on life skills

<ICE-SIN:S2B-039#126:3:C>
That's a programme which covers issues ranging from old age to
abortion to pre-marital sex

<ICE-SIN:S2B-039#127:3:C>
The case being discussed may be hypothetical but its content is
all too real

<ICE-SIN:S2B-039#128:3:C>
That's why life skills was introduced in nineteen eighty-nine

<ICE-SIN:S2B-039#129:3:C>
In covering issues like pre-marital sex the principal Mrs Song
feels that her students will be better able to cope with the facts of life

<ICE-SIN:S2B-039#130:3:C>
This way less mistakes will be made as they get older

<ICE-SIN:S2B-039#131:3:C>
Most schools don't follow the way of Pei Chai

<ICE-SIN:S2B-039#132:3:C>
What they do is to invite speakers like Dr Lim to give talks

<ICE-SIN:S2B-039#133:3:C>
But this is usually only once a year

<ICE-SIN:S2B-039#134:3:C>
But the laughter belies the serious nature of the subject

<ICE-SIN:S2B-039#135:3:C>
Last year Singapore Planned Parenthood visited seventy schools
like the Singapore Technical Institute where questions like can petting or
oral sex lead to pregnancy kept popping up

<ICE-SIN:S2B-039#136:3:C>
Dr Paul Tan president of the Singapore Planned Parenthood
Association spoke to producer Sylvian Poi

<ICE-SIN:S2B-039#137:3:C>
Problems like abortion

<ICE-SIN:S2B-039#138:3:C>
Here at K K girls below eighteen are first referred to Miss
Santadarun

<ICE-SIN:S2B-039#139:3:C>
And that's one reason why the Ministry of Health started the
teenage abortion counselling programme last December

<ICE-SIN:S2B-039#140:3:C>
With about eighteen hundred teenage abortions in nineteen ninety
it was a problem that had to be looked into

<ICE-SIN:S2B-039#141:3:C>
So what's the solution teaching sex education in schools <X>

<ICE-SIN:S2B-039#X142:3:C>
The problem is that many of us still blush when the topic of sex
is being discussed There's also the fear that sex education will encourage
students to go back and experiment It's a bold step but are we ready for it?
Well whether we are or not we can't ignore the fact that our teenagers may
know a lot but maybe not enough </X> </I>
