<h> MAXIMUM FINANCIAL PROTECTION AT VERY AFFORDABLE PREMIUM RATES </h>

<ICE-SIN:W1B-019#10:1>
June 1993.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-019#11:1>
Dear Cardholder,

<ICE-SIN:W1B-019#12:1>
You may ask yourself, " why do some people hesitate when it comes to
insurance?" That's because many insurance plans nowadays have become too
elaborate, it takes time to 'digest' what they mean and what they have to
offer.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-019#13:1>
I am pleased to offer you Family Life Plan, a plan designed specially
for DBS Visa and MasterCard cardholders like yourself.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-019#14:1>
A plan that is simple and extremely affordable.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-019#15:1>
A plan you'll feel comfortable with - for yourself, for the sake of
your family's continued well-being.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-019#16:1>
<h> ENJOY MAXIMUM COVERAGE: UP TO
&dollar;100,000 </h>

<ICE-SIN:W1B-019#17:1>
Family Life Plan will provide your loved ones maximum financial
protection if the worst ever happens.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-019#18:1>
In the event of your early demise, your family will receive an
immediate lump sum of up to
&dollar;100,000 in cash.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-019#19:1>
In addition, they will receive twice the amount if loss of life is
caused by an accident.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-019#20:1>
<h> PREMIUMS YOU CAN EASILY AFFORD </h>

<ICE-SIN:W1B-019#21:1>
Because we like you to enjoy absolute peace of mind, we have kept
premiums as low as possible.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-019#22:1>
Unlike costly 'cash return' plans.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-019#23:1>
you are fully protected for as little as
&dollar;19 a month!

<ICE-SIN:W1B-019#24:1>
While the plan offers no lump sum payment at the end of a fixed term,
it actually frees your cash flow so you can channel your money to higher
yielding investments of your choice.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-019#25:1>
Yet you receive full insurance protection year after year till age
60.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-019#26:1>
<h> EASY ENROLMENT, NO-FUSS PAYMENTS </h>

<ICE-SIN:W1B-019#27:1>

There are no medical examinations, no interviews and no lengthy
enrolment procedures.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-019#30:1>
What's more, premium payments are automatically debited from your DBS
Visa and MasterCard Card account for your convenience and to ensure your
coverage is never interrupted due to delayed payments.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-019#31:1>
<h> BACKED BY A TRUSTED NAME THROUGH THE YEARS </h>

<ICE-SIN:W1B-019#32:1>

Dear Customer,

<ICE-SIN:W1B-019#123:5>
<h> NON-TRANSFERABLE CHEQUES </h>

<ICE-SIN:W1B-019#124:5>
Further to our letter of 29 Nov 91 on non-transferable cheques, we
would like to address some common enquiries received. <h> Ordinary Crossed
Cheques </h>

<ICE-SIN:W1B-019#125:5>
Ordinary cheques with crossings such as " Account Payee Only", "
Account Payee", " Not Negotiable" will continue to be processed through the
present automated clearing system without additional charges or delay in
payment.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-019#126:5>
Although cheques bearing the " Account Payee Only" and " Not
Negotiable" crossings remain transferable in law, in ordinary circumstances,
they offer adequate protection against losses arising from fraud or
misappropriation of cheques as banks ordinarily collect Account Payee cheques
only for the named payee.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-019#127:5>
Further, " Not Negotiable' crossings on cheques which are affected
by fraud, or are stolen, prevent the fraudulent parties or thieves and any
subsequent transferee of such cheques from acquiring good title.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-019#128:5>
What are ' Non-Transferable Cheques?

<ICE-SIN:W1B-019#129:5>
Non-transferable cheques include cheques with the crossing " Not
Transferable" and those bearing any form of crossing and accompanied by the
word " only" after the payee's name.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-019#130:5>
e.g. pay to " XYZ only".

<ICE-SIN:W1B-019#131:5>
These cheques will be subject to charges and take a longer time to
be cleared for payment.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-019#132:5>
<h> Reasons for Manual Processing of Non-Transferable Cheques </h>

<ICE-SIN:W1B-019#133:5>
Unlike the ordinary crossed cheques, non-transferable cheques impose
an additional responsibility on the paying bank to ensure that only the named
payee receives the funds.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-019#134:5>
However, the paying bank cannot ascertain this through the automated
clearing system which only allows the paying bank to make payment on
individual cheques through the collecting bank and not to the payees
directly.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-019#135:5>
Hence non-transferable cheques have to be processed manually outside
of the automated clearing system.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-019#136:5>
The charges levied on the drawer ( S&dollar;20) and the payee ( S&dollar;5) are
necessary to cover the additional work required to process these cheques.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-019#137:5>
We hope that the above has sufficiently clarified your enquiries on
non-transferable cheques.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-019#138:5>
However, do contact us if you need further details.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-019#139:5>
