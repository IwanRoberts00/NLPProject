<I>

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-033#1:1:A>
I think we should not start with by comparing with far larger
countries with with far greater resources

<ICE-SIN:S1B-033#2:1:A>
It's always a matter at the end of whether you finally make the
profit so these are the first steps and of course there will be failures
there are going to be many more failures but we should not be deterred by it

<ICE-SIN:S1B-033#3:1:A>
But I was going to come back to Mr Onmae's point that uh we should
concentrate on services which of course I think is an area that we should be
in fact uh focus on but I do dispute the point that in manufacturing industry
we are not competitive

<ICE-SIN:S1B-033#4:1:A>
In all manufacturing industries if you if you try to uh examine
various facets of it there are areas in which Singapore will be competitive
<X>

<ICE-SIN:S1B-033#X5:1:A>
Martin </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-033#6:1:A>
I think selling out is not the uh right point here

<ICE-SIN:S1B-033#7:1:A>
I think it's getting yourself a mesh or getting yourself a a group
into a bigger base to go into the global market because going global is uh
not something that simple

<ICE-SIN:S1B-033#8:1:A>
As uh what uh Kent said earlier that Singapore can put itself uh
together with the whole region as the capital city but the problem here is we
have still this border despite what we talk about

<ICE-SIN:S1B-033#9:1:A>
The borderless world nations are still nations so there are still
barriers

<ICE-SIN:S1B-033#10:1:A>
But the day might might come as we talk about the free trade uh
area where Singapore could actually be the capital and as what Wee Hock said
earlier the infrastructure and all the pluses that we have could be made use
of uh to our benefit

<ICE-SIN:S1B-033#11:1:A>
So for Singapore companies when we team up with larger uh companies
or when you seek the path of a a listing for instance to get more capital is
to equip ourselves for globalisation

<ICE-SIN:S1B-033#12:1:A>
So when you companies uh teaming up or uh selling out to bigger uh
group is because of the products that they have that they are ready to
globalise and you need to take that path <X>

<ICE-SIN:S1B-033#X13:1:A>
Martin </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-033#14:1:B>
Yah I I I tend to agree with Dr Onmae that you know there is a
need to emphasize the other aspects rather than pure manufacturing

<ICE-SIN:S1B-033#15:1:B>
If you look at Singapore's history where have been good

<ICE-SIN:S1B-033#16:1:B>
Where have we been strong

<ICE-SIN:S1B-033#17:1:B>
We are good traders we are good builders of domestic we have built
a very good lifestyle for ourselves

<ICE-SIN:S1B-033#18:1:B>
We are good infrastructural people No reason why we shouldn't
continue to do these things but I think the more important thing is to
emphasize that we are a city state

<ICE-SIN:S1B-033#19:1:B>
We are not a nation in a sense of a nation having lots of
hinterland lots of resources we don't have that

<ICE-SIN:S1B-033#20:1:B>
We need to compete therefore in narrower areas

<ICE-SIN:S1B-033#21:1:B>
I don't like the word globalisation

<ICE-SIN:S1B-033#22:1:B>
I think that's too big a word but I would be very happy say one of
our newspapers acquired one of the Maxwell group newspaper tomorrow

<ICE-SIN:S1B-033#23:1:B>
And there's no reason in the world why we shouldn't think about
doing that kind of work

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-033#24:1:A>
I think Singaporean within our culture there are certain
products that can still be globalised

<ICE-SIN:S1B-033#25:1:A>
I don't see why McDonalds should be McDonalds and pizza should be
the only globalised food products

<ICE-SIN:S1B-033#26:1:A>
Chinese food noddles uh paos and uh even Peking ducks uh Singapore
food industry has gone into the roasting of ducks for Singaporeans

<ICE-SIN:S1B-033#27:1:A>
Let's hope that they go abroad and sell it you know to the Russians

<ICE-SIN:S1B-033#28:1:A>
Lots of hungry stomachs out there <X>

<ICE-SIN:S1B-033#X29:1:A>
Martin Dr Onmae Martin </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-033#30:1:B>
I I think it's a paradox about it in the sense that uh we've
been around as a nation in a sense with a free independent identity for about
twenty odd years

<ICE-SIN:S1B-033#31:1:B>
Therefore we cling to this need to keep our individualism we keep
talking about our ethnic roots

<ICE-SIN:S1B-033#32:1:B>
But the other point that I think that Dr Onmae is getting at which
is perhaps more important is that we are a city we are competitive with many
other cities in the world

<ICE-SIN:S1B-033#33:1:B>
To do that you begin to move into I suppose this word globalisation
where our bankers for instance some of our bankers among the best bankers in
the world

<ICE-SIN:S1B-033#34:1:B>
One of the world's top traders in foreign exchange resides in
Singapore is a Singaporean

<ICE-SIN:S1B-033#35:1:B>
We have got good accountants

<ICE-SIN:S1B-033#36:1:B>
We've got good lawyers

<ICE-SIN:S1B-033#37:1:B>
What we have to do then is to draw the line and say what is needed
to keep our identity as Singaporean

<ICE-SIN:S1B-033#38:1:B>
I think our Prime Minister mentioned you know 'char kway teow'
might be the emphasis to what makes us feel Singaporean

<ICE-SIN:S1B-033#39:1:B>
We need to draw the line between what is Singaporean and what is
the need to keep us competitive as a global city

<ICE-SIN:S1B-033#40:1:B>
The more we develop this idea of a mobile international urban elite
where people move in and out across countries the more we will capture good
people coming to Singapore

<ICE-SIN:S1B-033#41:1:B>
And no reason why a a good film director might not one day come to
Singapore because he likes the lifestyle here and uses this as a base from
which to do his business for the a marketing man <X>

<ICE-SIN:S1B-033#X42:1:B>
Martin </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-033#43:1:A>
I would advise you when you want to globalise to go into that
country and hire a bright young guy there who will probably be cheaper and I
can still achieve my objective as an entrepreneur <X>

<ICE-SIN:S1B-033#X44:1:A>
Martin </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-033#45:1:A>
Not necessarily within a globalise country and a globalise
state come people work for for international companies people work for for
salary for <unclear> word </unclear> for career goals and so on so long as
you manage him properly

<ICE-SIN:S1B-033#46:1:A>
And there are companies in Singapore who have got a lot of offices
and operations abroad who hire the locals

<ICE-SIN:S1B-033#47:1:A>
Nothing wrong with that

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-033#48:1:B>
I think there's nothing wrong with that except that we want to
give our younger executives more exposure abroad so that hopefully they in
time to come may lead other companies may break out on their own

<ICE-SIN:S1B-033#49:1:B>
And perhaps this is where the contacts of name national values
against international competition comes into play

<ICE-SIN:S1B-033#50:1:B>
Partly our Singaporeans feel comfortable in Singapore but the the
common problem that is being state stated is the issue of say things like
bilingualism

<ICE-SIN:S1B-033#51:1:B>
If my child must learn Mandarin if I am posted to China I suppose
that's not a problem or Taiwan but if I were to be posted somewhere else and
if my child doesn't pick up enough Mandarin then there could be very serious
for his future I suppose

<ICE-SIN:S1B-033#52:1:B>
So I think we have to make a trade-off here in Singapore

<ICE-SIN:S1B-033#53:1:B>
I'm not say that by by reason of this we should give up
bilingualism <X>

<ICE-SIN:S1B-033#X54:1:B>
Martin Dr Onmae Martin </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-033#55:1:B>
I'll like to raise a point that you know for instance our
students who go to a country like say the States they do very well there and
also many Singaporeans do move outside Singapore

<ICE-SIN:S1B-033#56:1:B>
I think your generalisation might be for country as a whole but if
you think of Singapore as a city with clusters of people I think we can make
our executives move a lot out of Singapore

<ICE-SIN:S1B-033#57:1:B>
The policy is less orientated towards elements such as say the
educational issue which is linked with national values

<ICE-SIN:S1B-033#58:1:B>
So I I believe that there are many opportunities for Singaporeans
to go abroad and that they can survive in the tough competitive world

<ICE-SIN:S1B-033#59:1:B>
Many of our bankers have lived outside and they have done quite
well when they went out <X>

<ICE-SIN:S1B-033#X60:1:B>
Dr Onmae Martin </X>

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-033#61:1:C>
I think finding the money is one thing the the thing to look
at might be that you are talking about two groups of uh business

<ICE-SIN:S1B-033#62:1:C>
One is for starters so for starters probably you really need seed
money where the risk is higher

<ICE-SIN:S1B-033#63:1:C>
The other group will be for what you said about the 'pao' uh
sellers who has already a business going has proven some success and wants to
first regionalise

<ICE-SIN:S1B-033#64:1:C>
So I think that group is where the venture capitals should come in
and the at the current state they don't take such big risk probably to look
at it and take a bigger risk and actually help them out uh via a packaging a
franchise road

<ICE-SIN:S1B-033#65:1:C>
Uh that would might involve uh lesser capital

<ICE-SIN:S1B-033#66:1:C>
Or actually finding them a business partner

<ICE-SIN:S1B-033#67:1:C>
And I think the thing for Singapore businesses to do now is
probably to look at alliances look at grouping themselves together and then
the seeking the market out because the market place outside is not uh as
simple as what Kent said earlier during the Japanese days where they could uh
sell a poorer or more inferior product because the market place at that time
is freer

<ICE-SIN:S1B-033#68:1:C>
The uh market demands for the goods are much larger than today

<ICE-SIN:S1B-033#69:1:C>
Today the competition is different so we should look at Singapore
now going into the next lap

<ICE-SIN:S1B-033#70:1:C>
The first twenty-five years is pretty simple <X>

<ICE-SIN:S1B-033#X71:1:C>
Martin </X>

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-033#72:1:C>
Oh during our times as I have said earlier in the early
seventies we started in seventy-one the demand is greater than supply and you
just need to work a little harder

<ICE-SIN:S1B-033#73:1:C>
Opportunities were plenty Today the situation is different

<ICE-SIN:S1B-033#74:1:C>
At that point in time to start a capital you need to start a
business you need very low capital

<ICE-SIN:S1B-033#75:1:C>
You could actually pass your hat around and get started

<ICE-SIN:S1B-033#76:1:C>
Today you're talking about millions of dollars

<ICE-SIN:S1B-033#77:1:C>
We started off with uh only twenty thousand dollars

<ICE-SIN:S1B-033#78:1:C>
So it's a different ball game so we could see that opportunities
are no more the same

<ICE-SIN:S1B-033#79:1:C>
The uh stage of uh development is totally different now

<ICE-SIN:S1B-033#80:1:C>
I agree with Kent we are such a small population base hardly three
million so we cannot be champions in everything

<ICE-SIN:S1B-033#81:1:C>
So maybe <X>

<ICE-SIN:S1B-033#X82:1:C>
Martin </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-033#83:1:A>
Well I I think the test of an entrepreneur is finally his
ability to find the money

<ICE-SIN:S1B-033#84:1:A>
Sure bankers have to be conservative

<ICE-SIN:S1B-033#85:1:A>
I think that and stock exchange have got to abide by its own rules

<ICE-SIN:S1B-033#86:1:A>
And sure it's going to be very difficult you know

<ICE-SIN:S1B-033#87:1:A>
But the poor pao maker just have to keep on going around passing
his hats and badgering his relatives and looking for companies to buy-out
sell-in or whatever

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-033#88:1:C>
I I uh agree with Wee Hock because at the end of the day the
businessman must find his own market must find his own business

<ICE-SIN:S1B-033#89:1:C>
But can we as a small state make it easier make it uh create the
opportunities create the avenues so if I was talking earlier you have this
people with bright ideas university students who come out with fantastic
projects so entrepreneur in the making

<ICE-SIN:S1B-033#90:1:C>
Now where do they go

<ICE-SIN:S1B-033#91:1:C>
So maybe in in the Singapore's context we have to look for
alternative

<ICE-SIN:S1B-033#92:1:C>
Maybe the setting up of an entrepreneurship fund might be useful
<X>

<ICE-SIN:S1B-033#X93:1:C>
Martin </X>

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-033#94:1:C>
Well when if we have a group or or a individual who has an
idea and feel that he could sell coming to this uh committee that's managing
a fund for instance <X>

<ICE-SIN:S1B-033#X95:1:C>
Martin </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-033#96:1:A>
Can can I just cut in because uh within the EDB during my time
we had a lot of experience trying to set up funds hundred million dollar two
hundred million dollar

<ICE-SIN:S1B-033#97:1:A>
The problem is always administering it who do you give to the
criterias and the risk of failures

<ICE-SIN:S1B-033#98:1:A>
I think it should be Singapore as a group or the government or the
EDB or whoever should provide the necessary incentives to overcome not to
overcome the risk but to make the risk worth taking

<ICE-SIN:S1B-033#99:1:A>
So some incentives must come for globalisation

<ICE-SIN:S1B-033#100:1:A>
One particular one will be to implement maybe a a reverse tax
incentive ten years

<ICE-SIN:S1B-033#101:1:A>
Since we give ten year pioneer status for companies to come here
why not give ten year pioneer status to companies who go abroad

<ICE-SIN:S1B-033#102:1:A>
If they are taxed abroad then that tax should be deductable
against local <unclear> word </unclear>

<ICE-SIN:S1B-033#103:1:A>
It's a reverse pioneer status <X>

<ICE-SIN:S1B-033#X104:1:A>
Dr Onmae Martin </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-033#105:1:B>
I think that uh the attitude towards failure doesn't

<ICE-SIN:S1B-033#106:1:B>
Sorry I think Kent's trying to come in <X>

<ICE-SIN:S1B-033#X107:1:B>
Dr Onmae Martin

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-033#X108:1:B>
I think he's got a point The point is that uh for Singapore
to grow bigger and the government having played a very large role in
Singapore you'll find that the more you want to go into the international
competitive area the smaller the role the the government plays or should play
or should be playing and maybe this is an important consideration We have
developed a host lieu of government-linked companies </X> </I>
