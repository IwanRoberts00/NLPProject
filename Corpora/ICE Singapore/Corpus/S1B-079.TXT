<ICE-SIN:S1B-079#X1:1> Property agent and client Thurs 18/3/99 </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-079#2:1:A>
Good morning Mr Bek

<ICE-SIN:S1B-079#3:1:A>
I'm glad that you are able to make it

<ICE-SIN:S1B-079#4:1:A>
Have a seat Mr Bek

<ICE-SIN:S1B-079#5:1:A>
You said that you were recommended by Teo

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-079#6:1:B>
Yes

<ICE-SIN:S1B-079#7:1:B>
My friend Teo was impressed by your ability to market his house at
such a good price as well and also so quickly too

<ICE-SIN:S1B-079#8:1:B>
When he knew that I wish to sell my house he quickly called me to
contact you

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-079#9:1:A>
That's nice of him

<ICE-SIN:S1B-079#10:1:A>
Thank you

<ICE-SIN:S1B-079#11:1:A>
I would be most glad to help you market your house

<ICE-SIN:S1B-079#12:1:A>
So I believe that you are looking for a house

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-079#13:1:B>
Oh yes I need you to get one for me

<ICE-SIN:S1B-079#14:1:B>
Okay

<ICE-SIN:S1B-079#15:1:B>
Let me tell you more of my house

<ICE-SIN:S1B-079#16:1:B>
The house I am staying now is a 5 I unit in Tampines

<ICE-SIN:S1B-079#17:1:B>
It's just passed five years

<ICE-SIN:S1B-079#18:1:B>
I bought it for one hundred and twenty-three thousand dollars

<ICE-SIN:S1B-079#19:1:B>
I wish to downgrade to a 4A or 4I unit in Tampines

<ICE-SIN:S1B-079#20:1:B>
Can you please give me some advice so as to what I should do etc

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-079#21:1:A>
Sure

<ICE-SIN:S1B-079#22:1:A>
Basically the guidelines towards purchasing a resale flat in the
open market is quite simple

<ICE-SIN:S1B-079#23:1:A>
Since you have a house it is easier at least on your finance

<ICE-SIN:S1B-079#24:1:A>
Before you get a loan from HDB they would want to use up all your
CPF funds in the ordinary account before they lend to you

<ICE-SIN:S1B-079#25:1:A>
So we have to check whether you have the sufficient twenty percent
deposit required when you purchased the house as well as your income to
determine the amount of loan available allowable for you

<ICE-SIN:S1B-079#26:1:A>
Oh

<ICE-SIN:S1B-079#27:1:A>
Is your wife going to be the co-owner that is she is sharing in the
payment of the house

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-079#28:1:B>
Yes my wife will be my co-owner and will be sharing in paying
for the house

<ICE-SIN:S1B-079#29:1:B>
We have a combined CPF of about eighty thousand dollars in our
ordinary account

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-079#30:1:A>
Okay

<ICE-SIN:S1B-079#31:1:A>
A 4a or 4I would fetch about two hundred and fifty thousand to two
hundred and eighty thousand depending on the location the level whether it is
at lift landing or not is it facing western/eastern sun etc

<ICE-SIN:S1B-079#32:1:A>
Quite a number of factors will be involved in the pricing of the
flat

<ICE-SIN:S1B-079#33:1:A>
Not forgetting the renovation done to the house

<ICE-SIN:S1B-079#34:1:A>
So your eighty thousand dollars would easily cover the deposit of
between fifty thousand to sixty thousand and also the stamp fees etc

<ICE-SIN:S1B-079#35:1:A>
How much are both of you earning now

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-079#36:1:B>
As for myself my gross salary is two thousand five hundred a
month and my wife's is about one thousand eight hundred a month

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-079#37:1:A>
And how much did you have to pay for your present five-room
and how much have both of you paid so far

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-079#38:1:B>
Our present house cost us one hundred and seven-three thousand
and we have paid so far about eight-six thousand dollars

<ICE-SIN:S1B-079#39:1:B>
How much can my house fetch now

<ICE-SIN:S1B-079#40:1:B>
Is it somewhere three hundred and fifty thousand

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-079#41:1:A>
Yeah

<ICE-SIN:S1B-079#42:1:A>
The market is about this amount

<ICE-SIN:S1B-079#43:1:A>
We have to call for valuation first

<ICE-SIN:S1B-079#44:1:A>
After which we can decide to advertise the amount we wish to sell

<ICE-SIN:S1B-079#45:1:A>
But before that we should look out for your new house first

<ICE-SIN:S1B-079#46:1:A>
In this way you can be assured of sufficient time to renovate your
new place to move in just in time for you to hand the keys of your five-room
flat to the new owner

<ICE-SIN:S1B-079#47:1:A>
All the process will take four months approximately but I will need
a total of six months to look for a house for you as well as marketing your
five-room

<ICE-SIN:S1B-079#48:1:A>
As for commission we charge a one per cent commission for helping
you to buy a flat and two per cent for selling your flat

<ICE-SIN:S1B-079#49:1:A>
If you agree on the terms spelt out can you please sign us an
exclusive for marketing your house

<ICE-SIN:S1B-079#50:1:A>
What do you think Mr Bek

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-079#51:1:B>
I think that is fine with me

<ICE-SIN:S1B-079#52:1:B>

<ICE-SIN:S1B-079#53:1:B>
