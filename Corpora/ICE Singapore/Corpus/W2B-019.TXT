<h> NEW SHARE ISSUES AND OTHER ISSUES </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-019#5:1>
<h> New Share Issues </h> Companies who are in need of funds for
investments and expansions may choose to raise the required sum through
public listings and rights issues.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-019#6:1>
There are various systems where new public listings ( new share issue)
can be conducted.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-019#7:1>
The most common ways are:

<ICE-SIN:W2B-019#8:1>
a) Public Issues

<ICE-SIN:W2B-019#9:1>
b) Tender system

<ICE-SIN:W2B-019#10:1>
c) Offers for Sale

<ICE-SIN:W2B-019#11:1>
d) Placements

<ICE-SIN:W2B-019#12:1>
<h> Public Issues </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-019#13:1>
This form of public listing is also known as fixed price offering
system.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-019#14:1>
The listing company will decide on the number of shares to offer and
the price of the shares which is called the issue price or offer price.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-019#15:1>
<h> Offer For Sale </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-019#16:1>
This involves an issuing house buying the shares at a fixed price or
a certain sum of money from the company and reselling them to investors at a
higher price.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-019#17:1>
<h> Auction Pricing System or Tender System </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-019#18:1>
Under this system, the company first set a minimum price per share
and applicants for the shares are required to bid the shares at a price of
their choice.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-019#19:1>
The company will then select a price above the minimum price from the
range of prices chosen by investors.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-019#20:1>
The selected price is known as the strike price.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-019#21:1>
Those who bid below the strike price will not be allotted the shares
while those who bid above the selected price will be allotted accordingly.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-019#22:1>
<h> Placing or Placement Agreement </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-019#23:1>
This involves the selling of new shares or large quantity of existing
shares to institutional buyers, private investors and agents.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-019#24:1>
<h> Are New Share Issues More Attractive? </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-019#25:1>
Many investors are drawn towards new share issues because they
believe that there is a good chance for the share price to rise upon listing.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-019#26:1>
For example, Compact Metal Industries offered at a price of
&dolalr;0.75, closed at the end of the first day of listing at
&dollar;1.66. 

<ICE-SIN:W2B-019#27:1>
Those investors holding the shares would have made a profit of
more than 100 per cent from the investment.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-019#28:1>
In general such a phenomenon happens to most issues.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-019#29:1>
However, there are also some new issues which have fallen below their
offer prices on the day they are listed.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-019#30:1>
For example, SIA shares closed at
&dollar;4.70 on its first trading day, a fall of 6.0 per cent from its offer price
of &dollar;5.00 in 1985.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-019#31:1>
Therefore the point is that a price rise of the shares upon listing
may not always occur for there are exceptions.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-019#32:1>
<h> Factors Affecting New Share Issues </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-019#33:1>
In the earlier chapters you have learnt that share prices rise when
they are presently traded below its worth, ( ie under-priced) in relation to
earnings.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-019#34:1>
The same reason applies to new share issues.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-019#35:1>
The factor causing the price for new share issue to rise is because
it is under-priced to provide an incentive to investors to buy the shares.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-019#36:1>
Furthermore, investors who buy new issues are faced with some form of
risks.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-019#37:1>
Firstly, it is uncertain as to how the shares will perform without a
previous trading record.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-019#38:1>
Secondly, investors have to bear the risk of a sudden change in
market trends during the period of the offering date and the listing date
which can last from a month or more.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-019#39:1>
For example, what if the stock market turns bearish after undergoing
an impressive bull run?

<ICE-SIN:W2B-019#40:1>
If it happens the chance of making a profit on listing day would be
lost.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-019#41:1>
As a result, the offer price of most new issues are usually
under-priced to some extent to make it more attractive to investors.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-019#42:1>
<h> Market Trends </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-019#43:1>
Shares prices are affected by market trends and sentiments.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-019#44:1>
In a bull market, new share issues are more well received and
attractive to investors.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-019#45:1>
Upon listing, there will be greater buying interests and support
leading to a price rise.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-019#46:1>
However, in a bear market, while only a handful who knows how to
select the good quality stocks will enter the market, most investors stay
away from the market.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-019#47:1>
Hence, a price rise will not occur due to the lack of demand.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-019#48:1>
<h> Trading on " When Issued Basis" </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-019#49:1>
Trading on a " when issued" basis is a trading facility which allows
investors to trade the shares in an IPO ( Initial Public Offering ) before
investors are confirmed of their allotment of shares and before the shares
are officially listed.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-019#50:1>
This facility is implemented by the SES with the aim of reducing the
risks of investing in new share issues.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-019#51:1>
Trading on a " when issued" basis will normally begin on the next day
after balloting of share applications.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-019#52:1>
Trading will continue until the third business day after despatch of
notifications of allotments to CDP account holders.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-019#53:1>
All buy and sell trades done on " when issued" basis will be due for
settlement on a single date.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-019#54:1>
This date will be the same as the settlement date for trades done on
the first day of trading on normal ready basis.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-019#55:1>
Investors should be warned that if they wish to sell the share during
this period, they are doing so at their own risk.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-019#56:1>
This is because they could be selling shares which they do not own
when they find out that they have been unsuccessful in the allotment.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-019#57:1>
In such an event, if the investors do not have sufficient shares in
the Securities Accounts with CDP on settlement date, the shares will be
bought in by SES.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-019#58:1>
<h> Studying The Prospectus </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-019#59:1>
Before you plunge into buying new issues, you should read the
prospectus like the way you read the annual report.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-019#60:1>
You should note the following:

<ICE-SIN:W2B-019#61:1>
1) History and nature of business

<ICE-SIN:W2B-019#62:1>
2) Earnings performance and various accounting ratios such as
earnings per share, net tangible asset, dividend yield, price earning ratio
and debt to equity ratio

<ICE-SIN:W2B-019#63:1>
3) Growth prospects

<ICE-SIN:W2B-019#64:1>
4) Management quality

<ICE-SIN:W2B-019#65:1>
5) The deadline for submission of your application

<ICE-SIN:W2B-019#66:1>
In addition, there are two other types of information that are worth
taking note of.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-019#67:1>
They are: a) Issue Purpose: This tells you the reason for the issue.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-019#68:1>
In most cases, the reason given is for further investments and
expansions.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-019#69:1>
b) Size of issue: The issue size has an effect on the share price on
listing day.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-019#70:1>
In general, the larger the issue, the more likely that demand would
be met.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-019#71:1>
As a result, it becomes difficult for the shares to fetch a higher
price as there could be more supply than demand.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-019#72:1>
However, if the issue size is small, there would be a greater chance
for the shares to be over subscribed and hence a price rise.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-019#73:1>
This is because those investors who have not been allotted the shares
but are still keen on buying will offer to buy at higher prices.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-019#74:1>
<h> Electronic Share Application ( ESA) </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-019#75:1>
The Electronic Share Application ( ESA) system enables ATM
cardholders of selected banks to apply for Initial Public Offers ( IPOs) of
any specified share issue.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-019#76:1>
This removes the inconvenience of buying a bank overdraft from the
banks and the submission of application forms.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-019#77:1>
The ESA system is currently provided by POSB, DBS, OCBC bank group
and OUB but more banks will soon be providing the service, particularly the
other CPF agent banks.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-019#78:1>
<h> Using Your CPF Savings for Initial Public Offering ( IPO) </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-019#79:1>
Check that you have sufficient funds in your CPF Investment Account
to pay for the shares.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-019#80:1>
If it is insufficient, you can transfer additional funds from your
investible savings in your CPF Ordinary Account to your Investment Account.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-019#81:1>
Transfer can be made by: a) Using your CPF- Personal Auto Link ( CPF
PAL Phone) before 8 pm on weekdays and 1 pm on Saturdays ( excluding public
holidays).

<ICE-SIN:W2B-019#82:1>
b) Submit the CPF withdrawal form to CPF Board through its offices
before 2 pm on weekdays.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-019#83:1>
The transferred funds will be credited to your Investment Account on
the next business day.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-019#84:1>
For withdrawal application made after the time mentioned earlier, the
funds will only be available on the second business day.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-019#85:1>
The latest date for making the transfer is the day before the closing
day of the share offer.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-019#86:1>
Next, you need to buy a CPF Cashier's Order from your agent bank and
submit together with your application form.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-019#87:1>
Alternatively, at your convenience, you may use your ATM card to
apply for the shares if your agent bank provides such a service ( Electronic
Share Application).

<ICE-SIN:W2B-019#88:1>
Although new share issues will likely experience a price rise upon
trading on the open market, it does not imply that every new listings will be
profitable.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-019#89:1>
The outcome depends very much on the market trends at the point of
trading and the share's fundamentals which will shape the perceptions of
investors towards the shares and hence the demand.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-019#90:1>
However even if the shares performed below your expectation, it may
in the long run becomes quality stocks.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-019#91:1>
<h> Bonus Issues </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-019#92:1>
A company may issue bonus shares to its shareholders when it has
substantial revenue reserves.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-019#93:1>
Bonus shares are issued in proportion to the number of registered
shares held by the shareholders.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-019#94:1>
For instance, if the company announces a 1 for 2 bonus issues, it
means that shareholders will receive 1 bonus shares for every 2 shares held.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-019#95:1>
<h> Entitlement to a Bonus Issue </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-019#96:1>
Bonus shares are issued to the existing registered shareholders and
to those investors who buy the shares at a price quoted on a cum bonus basis.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-019#97:1>
However to qualify for the entitlement of bonus shares you must have
the shares registered in your name before the book closure date ( this
applies to the non-scripless counters where you are holding physical scrips).

<ICE-SIN:W2B-019#98:1>
The book closure date is the deadline for buyers to register their
shares with the company in order to be entitled the bonus shares or any other
entitlements.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-019#99:1>
<h> Your Securities Account and Bonus Issue </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-019#100:1>
Under scripless trading, if you are entitled to the bonus issue, CDP
will credit your bonus shares to your Direct Securities Account to your
holdings in proportion to your holdings.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-019#101:1>
You will be informed by CDP of the allotment by mail if your are a
Direct Securities Account holders or by your Depository Agent if you are a
Sub-Account holder.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-019#102:1>
<h> Do I Benefit from a Bonus Issue? </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-019#103:1>
You may gain from a reduction of your cost per share and hence
increasing your profit margin if you sell it after the bonus issue.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-019#104:1>
For example, assuming you buy 1,000 ABC shares at
&dollar;3.00. 

<ICE-SIN:W2B-019#105:1>
When the company announce a one for one bonus issue, you will
receive another 1,000 shares for free.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-019#106:1>
Hence, the cost per share would be reduced to
&dollar;1.50 (
&dollar;3,000 divided by 2,000) instead of
&dollar;3.00. 

<ICE-SIN:W2B-019#107:1>
After the bonus issue if the share price ( ex-bonus price)
goes up to above
&dollar;1.50, you will make a profit if you sell it.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-019#108:1>
You can also benefit from a price rise of the shares if you already
owned the shares before the bonus issue is officially confirmed.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-019#109:1>
Usually, when there are news of a bonus issue for a stock, the price
of the stock tends to rise as investors chase the stock.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-019#110:1>
Investors are attracted to the stocks as they think that they can
benefit from a price rise after the bonus issue.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-019#111:1>
For example you bought the shares at
&dollar;3.00 and on rumours of a bonus issue, the price rocketed to

&dollar;3.60. 

<ICE-SIN:W2B-019#112:1>
At this instance, you may choose to take profit if you think
that the appreciation in the share price after the bonus issue may be too
small or not occur at all.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-019#113:1>
You may also make a loss if for instance, you bought 1,000 shares at
&dollar;3.60 with a 1 for 1 bonus issue just before the exdate.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-019#114:1>
Your cost per share would be
&dollar;1.80 (
&dollar;3600 divided by 2000).

<ICE-SIN:W2B-019#115:1>
If the share price falls to
&dollar;1.60 on the following day after the price has been adjusted you make a loss
of
&dollar;0.20 per share.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-019#116:1>
<h> Rights Issues </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-019#117:1>
Rights issues involve the issuing of rights to existing shareholders
in proportion to the number of shares they already owned to subscribe for new
shares at a special price ( usually below the market price).

<ICE-SIN:W2B-019#118:1>
For example, if the company decide on a one for two rights issue, it
means that an existing shareholder will be entitled to the right to buy 1 new
share for every 2 shares that he held. <X>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-019#X119:1>
Shareholders entitled to the rights may chose to accept it and use
it to buy the shares at the stated price or sell it on the stock exchange.
