We awarded many young people whose achievements have benefited
our society

<ICE-SIN:S2B-035#2:1:A>
They may be pioneers in their own field or prefer to serve the
community by helping those who are less unfortunate than they are

<ICE-SIN:S2B-035#3:1:A>
Whichever the case all are exemplary and an inspiration to others

<ICE-SIN:S2B-035#4:1:A>
The awards have been given out every year to individuals or teens
who excel in various fields be it within or outside their chosen professions

<ICE-SIN:S2B-035#5:1:A>
Celebrating the silver jubilee the awards foster a sense of national
pride in our youths

<ICE-SIN:S2B-035#6:1:A>
Some have achieved international honour for Singapore but these are
ordinary young people who strive to attain their dreams no matter how
impossible they seem

<ICE-SIN:S2B-035#7:1:A>
A selfless quality and an unwavering passion for their work have
served to strengthen the social fabric of our nation and their innovative
ideas have not only put Singapore on the world map but have far-reaching
benefits at home

<ICE-SIN:S2B-035#8:1:A>
The awardees are self-motivated and dedicated to their dreams
sustained by a strong vision

<ICE-SIN:S2B-035#9:1:A>
Some are trail blazers who demonstrate great courage in the face of
diversity

<ICE-SIN:S2B-035#10:1:A>
Although they are honoured by what they have achieved before the
age of 35 their service is ongoing

<ICE-SIN:S2B-035#11:1:A>
For these young people the Singapore Youth Award is not an end but
only the beginning a testament to the endless possibility they can achieve

<ICE-SIN:S2B-035#12:1:A>
Apart from his wealth of medical expertise Dr Tan Chee Choo is an
adventurer and a humanitarian

<ICE-SIN:S2B-035#13:1:A>
Not only does he help the under-privileged he also encourages young
people to broaden their horizon and to develop a sense of community spirit

<ICE-SIN:S2B-035#14:1:A>
Whether he is leading a medical expedition to a remote part of the
world or organising a local fund raising event Dr Tan's passion to help his
fellow man and his sense of adventure is infectious

<ICE-SIN:S2B-035#15:1:A>
He witnessed the brutality of war when he was sent on the Singapore
Armed Forces Gulf War medical mission in 1991

<ICE-SIN:S2B-035#16:1:A>
He saw the devastation of the natural catastrophe when he led a
medical relief mission to the Philippines after a 1990 earthquake

<ICE-SIN:S2B-035#17:1:A>
And he helped to relieve the human suffering of poverty and disease

<ICE-SIN:S2B-035#18:1:A>
In fact since the age of 26 Dr Tan Chee Choo has been involved in
ten missions to underdeveloped or remote areas of the world whether military
or scientific or part of Singapore

<ICE-SIN:S2B-035#19:1:A>
Each expedition expands Dr Tan's repertoire of community work

<ICE-SIN:S2B-035#20:1:A>
Now he actively heads projects which encourage young people to
follow in his footsteps </I>

<ICE-SIN:S2B-035#21:2:B>
No kidding

<ICE-SIN:S2B-035#22:2:B>
It's the truth

<ICE-SIN:S2B-035#23:2:B>
I don't lie

<ICE-SIN:S2B-035#24:2:B>
It's the truth

<ICE-SIN:S2B-035#25:2:B>
It's going to be a great show

<ICE-SIN:S2B-035#26:2:B>
On the show tonight ladies and gentlemen we got from Chang and Eng
the producer and director Ekachai Uekrongtham

<ICE-SIN:S2B-035#27:2:B>
Ya also from Chang and Eng we have the composer and lyricist Ken
Low is with us

<ICE-SIN:S2B-035#28:2:B>
Ken Low very low Ken Low

<ICE-SIN:S2B-035#29:2:B>
Also ladies and gentlemen I have respected this man for many many
years

<ICE-SIN:S2B-035#30:2:B>
Very funny comedian and writer and a blues singer as well Siva Choy
is with us tonight ladies and gentlemen

<ICE-SIN:S2B-035#31:2:B>
Yah so this week you guys did you all hear the latest thing is now
ah LTA has come out with a website for traffic

<ICE-SIN:S2B-035#32:2:B>
What happens is that they have installed satellite systems into
each taxi so that when you log on onto internet on the website it tells you
on the map which road is a lot of traffic jam which road is clear and all
that

<ICE-SIN:S2B-035#33:2:B>
This is amazing

<ICE-SIN:S2B-035#34:2:B>
I think this is fantastic

<ICE-SIN:S2B-035#35:2:B>
Finally there is a technology like that

<ICE-SIN:S2B-035#36:2:B>
This is amazing what happens is this

<ICE-SIN:S2B-035#37:2:B>
If you log on and you look on the map if you see a green road

<ICE-SIN:S2B-035#38:2:B>
Green road means clear no traffic

<ICE-SIN:S2B-035#39:2:B>
That∆s good

<ICE-SIN:S2B-035#40:2:B>
Go ahead and drive there if you want to if you are going out

<ICE-SIN:S2B-035#41:2:B>
Now red the opposite would mean traffic jam

<ICE-SIN:S2B-035#42:2:B>
Pink it means your computer spoil

<ICE-SIN:S2B-035#43:2:B>
But the latest thing also is digital radio

<ICE-SIN:S2B-035#44:2:B>
Have you guys heard this

<ICE-SIN:S2B-035#45:2:B>
This is new to me

<ICE-SIN:S2B-035#46:2:B>
I just found out only a few days ago

<ICE-SIN:S2B-035#47:2:B>
Digital radio

<ICE-SIN:S2B-035#48:2:B>
Radio is going digital which means you will hear extra clear crisp
sounds

<ICE-SIN:S2B-035#49:2:B>
Music and everything will be so clear but on top of that technology
it would allow you to hear the deejays who have fake American accents to hear
the Singapore English

<ICE-SIN:S2B-035#50:2:B>
For example if this deejay comes on the air with this fake American
accent going Êhello everybody we got Mariah Carey have we got a little song
form her

<ICE-SIN:S2B-035#51:2:B>
It's the latest one called I want to wear his clothes for you baby

<ICE-SIN:S2B-035#52:2:B>
It's a really nice cool song

<ICE-SIN:S2B-035#53:2:B>
Check it out

<ICE-SIN:S2B-035#54:2:B>
Now that is a fake American accent

<ICE-SIN:S2B-035#55:2:B>
What would happen is that digital radio would translate this and
come out with Singapore English immediately and you will hear

<ICE-SIN:S2B-035#56:2:B>
Okay

<ICE-SIN:S2B-035#57:2:B>
Now got this song ah

<ICE-SIN:S2B-035#58:2:B>
Quite nice lah and the title so long

<ICE-SIN:S2B-035#59:2:B>
So what for we say ha

<ICE-SIN:S2B-035#60:2:B>
Uh the girl the singer is Malay Curry eh

<ICE-SIN:S2B-035#61:2:B>
Is a very good song uh you see lah you listen

<ICE-SIN:S2B-035#62:2:B>
Okay lah

<ICE-SIN:S2B-035#63:2:B>
I press play button ha okay

<ICE-SIN:S2B-035#64:2:B>
That would be the English translation isn't that a great
translation uh

<ICE-SIN:S2B-035#65:2:B>
We wanted to get a er‡a apecial guest here on the show

<ICE-SIN:S2B-035#66:2:B>
We couldn't because they are still going undergoing therapy as I
understand uh we are talking about of course uh the Tamarinds the monkeys
that were kidnapped

<ICE-SIN:S2B-035#67:2:B>
You heard about that the monkeys that were kidnapped from the zoo
and you knew it was a big thing and all that

<ICE-SIN:S2B-035#68:2:B>
I think we should give an applause for the authorities for catching
them back again safe and sound

<ICE-SIN:S2B-035#69:2:B>
I think that was good on the news

<ICE-SIN:S2B-035#70:2:B>
But I want to want to ask a question

<ICE-SIN:S2B-035#71:2:B>
When the kidnappers were taking the monkeys away what were they
thinking

<ICE-SIN:S2B-035#72:2:B>
Were they thinking of selling the monkeys to somebody here in
Singapore

<ICE-SIN:S2B-035#73:2:B>
Go to aunty aunty no no this one is that the monkey that one stolen
one

<ICE-SIN:S2B-035#74:2:B>
It's actually red rabbit very good for Chinese New Year angpow

<ICE-SIN:S2B-035#75:2:B>
I think those kidnappers are basically idiots

<ICE-SIN:S2B-035#76:2:B>
That's what they are </I>

<ICE-SIN:S2B-035#77:3:C>
May Day 1989 is a time for rejoicing

<ICE-SIN:S2B-035#78:3:C>
Four years ago on May Day 1985 Singaporeans were down in the dumps
suffering their first recession since 1964

<ICE-SIN:S2B-035#79:3:C>
What have we learnt from this experience

<ICE-SIN:S2B-035#80:3:C>
First that we must be careful not to push high wage increases in
1979 and should have stopped them by 1982

<ICE-SIN:S2B-035#81:3:C>
Unfortunately we repeated them in 1983 and 1984 and these wage
increases ran ahead of productivity growth

<ICE-SIN:S2B-035#82:3:C>
This caused our unit labour cost to be higher than that of South
Korea Taiwan and Hong Kong

<ICE-SIN:S2B-035#83:3:C>
Second the strengthening Singapore dollar increased our
uncompetitiveness in exports

<ICE-SIN:S2B-035#84:3:C>
We must avoid repeating this error by closely monitoring wage
levels productivity increases exchange rates and the profitability of
enterprises in Singapore compared to South Korea Taiwan and Hong Kong

<ICE-SIN:S2B-035#85:3:C>
We corrected our errors by cutting costs and so enabled managements
to recapture exports that made for 1988's growth rate of 11 per cent

<ICE-SIN:S2B-035#86:3:C>
Could we have guaranteed this recovery

<ICE-SIN:S2B-035#87:3:C>
No way

<ICE-SIN:S2B-035#88:3:C>
The union had to depend on the government's judgments and good
faith

<ICE-SIN:S2B-035#89:3:C>
The NTUC was formed in 1961 after the non-Communist unions split
away from the Association of Trade Union <&>  SATU </&> which was controlled by
pro-Communist union

<ICE-SIN:S2B-035#90:3:C>
A few weeks before that 13 pro-Communist Assemblymen had broken
away from the PAP to form the Barisan Sosialis

<ICE-SIN:S2B-035#91:3:C>
From the start there was trust and confidence between PAP and NTUC

<ICE-SIN:S2B-035#92:3:C>
It has been maintained ever since

<ICE-SIN:S2B-035#93:3:C>
NTUC leaders knew that PAP Government policies were tailored to
help generate high profits for companies in order that we can wipe out
unemployment and later pay better wages

<ICE-SIN:S2B-035#94:3:C>
As the economy advanced good wages plus high government revenues
paid for HDB homes good hospitals schools community centres and all the
infrastructure and facilities of modern city

<ICE-SIN:S2B-035#95:3:C>
Today 84 per cent of our workers own their own homes

<ICE-SIN:S2B-035#96:3:C>
All have CPF accounts averaging

$37000 after ten years and

$22000 after five years

<ICE-SIN:S2B-035#97:3:C>
Once we knew by mid 1988 that we headed for exceptional growth the
government restored all pay cuts in the public sector

<ICE-SIN:S2B-035#98:3:C>
When we knew by December 1988 that we had made 11 per cent growth
we declared one and a half months year end bonus on top of the one month
Annual Wage Supplement

<ICE-SIN:S2B-035#99:3:C>
We have set the pace for the private sector

<ICE-SIN:S2B-035#100:3:C>
Employers must play their part in maintaining trust and confidence
between their workers and themselves

<ICE-SIN:S2B-035#101:3:C>
When workers have shared hard times they deserve to share good
times

<ICE-SIN:S2B-035#102:3:C>
Workers management and government have a joint responsibility to
keep up this climate of trust and confidence in each other </I>
