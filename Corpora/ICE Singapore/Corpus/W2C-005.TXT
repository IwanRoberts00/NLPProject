<h> Trainee teachers to get a feel of military life later this year

<ICE-SIN:W2C-005#4:1>
Scheme to build awareness of nation-building values

<ICE-SIN:W2C-005#5:1>

<ICE-SIN:W2C-005#6:1>
Trainee teachers will get a feel of military life and an insight into
defence-related issues in a new familiarisation programme to be launched
later this year.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-005#7:1>
Second Defence Minister Dr Lee Boon Yang said that the National
Institute of Education and the Defence Ministry are finalising details for a
pilot programme to be introduced later this year.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-005#8:1>
He did not say whether the programme would be confined to women or
will include male trainee teachers as well.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-005#9:1>
He said yesterday: " The intention is to provide trainee teachers with
an awareness of nation-building values, which they can impart through all
aspects of their school curricula." The idea for the programme is a spin off
from the Defence Familiarisation Programme for women, launched last year, for
final-year female junior college students.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-005#10:1>
The idea to put trainee teachers through a similar programme was put
forward by members of the Advisory Council on Community Relations In Defence
( Accord) at Mindef in Bukit Gombak, where he officiated at a short ceremony
to welcome four new members to the council, which he chairs.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-005#11:1>
Eleven members were re-appointed and four others retired after having
served between two and three years in Accord.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-005#12:1>
Accord was formed in 1984 to seek increasing support and recognition
for national servicemen and reservists from their families, employers and
peers.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-005#13:1>
It also helps to create awareness and understanding among the general
public of their roles in total Defence.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-005#14:1>
Dr Lee called the council " Mindef's best critics" and the first
public audience for policy changes and mass communication programmes.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-005#15:1>
Its members hold senior positions in various sectors of the community
such as grassroots organisations, schools, the business sector and
government.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-005#16:1>
In recalling some of the major contributions of Accord, Dr Lee said
that when Mindef first presented the Defence Familiarisation Programme for
Women to Accord, council members highlighted the need to involve teachers in
the programme as well.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-005#17:1>
Accord members said that it would give teachers a better
understanding of the SAF for general discussions with their students on
Singapore's survival, security and success, noted Dr Lee.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-005#18:1>
In the nine-day programme for female junior college students,
Singapore's national security issues were examined through group discussions
and policy-gaming classroom sessions.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-005#19:1>
The group also stayed at an army camp where they got to handle some
military equipment and weapons.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-005#20:1>
Dr Lee said that other Accord contributions over the years included
suggestions to make the dial-a-date system, for the booking of fitness test
dates for reservists, simpler and more user-friendly.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-005#21:1>
More recently, Accord members were briefed on the mandatory
requirement for reservists to inform Mindef of their overseas travel if it is
longer than 24 hours.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-005#22:1>
Dr Lee said that suggestions from the council to put up notices along
the way to the Causeway and to install toll-free lines at the airport for
reservists to make last-minute calls to the Mindef Notification Centre are
now being considered for implementation.

<h> Nature Society wants Khatib Bongsu and Senoko conserved </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2C-005#40:2>
By Dominic Nathan

<ICE-SIN:W2C-005#41:2>
CONSERVE the bird-rich Senoko and Khatib Bongsu nature sites instead
of Telok Blangah Hill, Mount Faber and the Western Catchment areas, suggests
the Nature Society ( Singapore).

<ICE-SIN:W2C-005#42:2>
In its feedback on the Government's Green Plan, the society proposed
this " exchange" to save what it declared as Singapore's two " five star"
nature areas and other sites.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-005#43:2>
The working group on nature conservation under the Green Plan
recommended that 18 nature areas, ranging from primary forests to mangrove
swamps and hillocks, be conserved.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-005#44:2>
The areas will add up to about 3,130 ha, or 5 per cent of Singapore's
total land area - equal to 13 Toa Payoh estates.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-005#45:2>
The working group on nature conservation is one of six groups set up
by the Government to work out policy directions to help Singapore realise its
vision of becoming a model Green City.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-005#46:2>
In its written report, released to The Straits Times yesterday, the
society said: " Singapore is not forthcoming or seriously committed to nature
conservation and the principle of bio-diversity, if important areas such as
Senoko and Khatib Bongsu are left out of the category of nature areas." On
the proposed exchange of sites for conservation, the society said six of 18
sites demarcated as nature areas were public parks with little flora or
fauna, while another site, which forms a substantial part of the total area,
was actually the Singapore Armed Forces' live-firing area.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-005#47:2>
The society proposed that four other sites be conserved instead: *
SENOKO: It consists of the mangrove, palm forest and ponds on either side of
Sungei Sembawang.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-005#48:2>
The area is the richest bird site in Singapore in terms of species
and numbers.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-005#49:2>
Found here are 189 species or 57 per cent of the total number of
species recorded in Singapore, including internationally endangered birds
like the Chinese Egret and the Asian Dowitcher.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-005#50:2>
* KHATIB BONGSU: The coastal wetland site off Yishun is home to 150
different species of birds, including several species of Herons.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-005#51:2>
In the migratory season, up to 10,000 birds feed and nest at the
site.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-005#52:2>
* PUNGGOL GRASSLAND: The 50-ha site is the only substantial grassland
habitat in Singapore.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-005#53:2>
Although an HDB estate is planned for the area, the NSS hopes that
the site could be built into the estate as a nature park, complete with
trails.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-005#54:2>
* BATU PUTEH TERNERY: The rocky islet off the northern Changi coast
is the nesting site of the Black-naped Tern, featured in Singapore's
&dollar;1 note.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-005#55:2>
The NSS also suggested that once the nature areas are finalised, they
should be legislated as such to ensure their protection.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-005#56:2>
In addition, the society said that a coordinating body, consisting of
representatives from tertiary institutions, the NSS and other organisations,
should be formed to assist the National Parks Board in the management of
nature areas.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-005#57:2>
The NSS feedback, together with other suggestions raised during
public forums and discussions with interest groups, will be considered by the
respective work groups over the next two months before the final Green Plan
is released in September.

<h> Dispute over trade in endangered wildlife </h> <h> 'Banned' birds
not imported illegally: PPD </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2C-005#59:2>
Report by Dominic Nathan

<ICE-SIN:W2C-005#60:2>
THE " resident" songbird of housing estate bird shows, the
Mata-Puteh, is not being smuggled in from Malaysia.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-005#61:2>
Neither is the Red-whiskered Bulbul being brought in illegally from
Thailand.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-005#62:2>
The Primary Production Department has refuted allegations, by the
National Council on the Environment ( NCE), that the birds were being sold
here despite being banned for export in their countries of origin.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-005#63:2>
The birds are available throughout the region, maintained the PPD.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-005#64:2>
The PPD spokesman also said that the birds are imported here legally
as they are not listed as protected species under Cites, the international
convention on wildlife trade.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-005#65:2>
This is the latest development in the dispute between the PPD and the
NCE over Singapore's alleged role as a transhipment centre in the illegal
trade of endangered species.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-005#66:2>
The controversy enters its second week as the PPD has challenged
evidence of illegal wildlife trade here, provided by Mr Robert Kwan, the
NCE's chairman, to The Sunday Times last week.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-005#67:2>
In the June 6 report, Mr Kwan maintained that although Malaysia has
banned the export of the Mata-Puteh and Thailand, the Red-Whiskered Bulbul,
both birds can be found in shops here.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-005#68:2>
He said that a survey of 46 bird shops here last year and this year
found at least 150 species of Indonesian birds being traded here, although
Indonesia listed only 46 species as being approved for export.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-005#69:2>
Mr Kwan's evidence came from the international wildlife monitoring
agency, Traffic Southeast Asia, based in Kuala Lumpur.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-005#70:2>
In reply, the PPD said that Mr Kwan had failed to substantiate his
statement about Singapore's role in the illegal trade.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-005#71:2>
Said its spokesman: " However, he now implies that by the presence of 'protected
birds' in Singapore, they are illegally imported, and such imports are
tolerated by the Singapore authorities.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-005#72:2>
" This is not true and needs clarification.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-005#73:2>
" He explained that if a country wishes to stop the trade in its
birds, it should list it under the Convention on International Trade in
Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-005#74:2>
He pointed out that the two birds in question are not listed by any
country.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-005#75:2>
In addition, they are native to many countries in this part of the
world, such as Burma, India, China and Vietnam, aside from Malaysia and
Thailand.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-005#76:2>
All of these countries also export their birds to Singapore, he said.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-005#77:2>
Mr Kwan's assumption that the birds are either smuggled in or allowed
in by PPD, in contravention of Cites, is therefore not true.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-005#78:2>
He noted that the convention, which Singapore signed in 1986, only
regulates trade in endangered wildlife, and does not ban the trade of
protected birds.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-005#79:2>
Protected birds under Cites fall under three groups: <X>

<ICE-SIN:W2C-005#X80:2>
Appendix I: Birds listed here are absolutely not allowed to be
traded unless under special conditions, like for zoos and research.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-005#X81:2>
Appendix II: Birds here are protected, but international trade is
allowed, subject to the convention rules.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-005#X82:2>
Appendix III: Birds listed by certain countries which seek the
co-operation of other countries to prevent or restrict their export.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-005#X83:2>
The Singapore Avicultural Society also commented on Traffic
Southeast Asia's findings. </X>

<ICE-SIN:W2C-005#84:2>
A society spokesman said that the protected birds found in local bird
shops included several species of soft-billed birds, which are not given any
international protection at all.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-005#85:2>
In addition, some of the protected birds may have been imported
before Singapore signed Cites in 1986.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-005#86:2>
Since the Cites export quotas are updated annually, the Traffic
checks carried out at bird shops may have included birds allowed into
Singapore under earlier quotas, he added.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-005#87:2>
As for the NCE chairman's comments on the need to introduce wider
laws and plug existing legal loopholes to prevent protected species from
being traded here, the PPD said: " Mr Robert Kwan is requesting Singapore to
go beyond the requirements of Cites. <X> <quote>

<ICE-SIN:W2C-005#X88:2>
" This is different from implying that Singapore is not following
the convention, and is a centre for illegal trade in wildlife." </X> </quote>

THE STRAITS TIMES, THURSDAY, JUNE 17, 1993

<ICE-SIN:W2C-005#90:3>
<h> HOME </h> <h> Malaria danger over, but dengue threat is rising
</h>

<ICE-SIN:W2C-005#91:3>
Number of breeding sites has risen in last 3 months

<ICE-SIN:W2C-005#92:3>
By Dominic Nathan

<ICE-SIN:W2C-005#93:3>
MALARIA has been overcome, but now dengue fever is threatening to
break out across the island.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-005#94:3>
The number of breeding sites has gone up over the last three months
signalling a potential new outbreak.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-005#95:3>
The number of homes found breeding the Aedes mosquito went up to 953
last month, from 817 in April and 626 in March.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-005#96:3>
Dengue fever is spread by the Aedes mosquito.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-005#97:3>
In fact, the Aedes mosquito was found breeding in 48 per cent of
outdoor sites checked last month.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-005#98:3>
In March it was found in only 8 per cent of sites checked and in
April, 9 per cent.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-005#99:3>
The increasing incidence of Aedes breeding sites comes barely a week
after the Environment Ministry declared the malaria outbreak at Punggol over.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-005#100:3>
More than 20 people were infected between late April and mid-May.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-005#101:3>
On the dengue situation, an ENV spokesman said that the recent rainy
spell had resulted in water collecting in receptacles, both discarded and
those stored outdoors. <X>

<ICE-SIN:W2C-005#X102:3>
Plastic and canvas sheets, defective roof gutters and blocked
drains are also common breeding sites.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-005#X103:3>
The spokesman added: " The public is reminded to be extra vigilant
in preventing mosquito breeding in their homes during this rainy period." The
number of cases of dengue fever still remains low.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-005#X104:3>
There were 10 isolated cases reported last week, a dramatic drop
compared with the 140 cases a week in July last year, at the peak of the
three-year outbreak.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-005#X105:3>
This claimed 15 lives and afflicted nearly 7,000 people.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-005#X106:3>
It is an offence to breed mosquitoes.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-005#X107:3>
First offenders can be fined S50.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-005#X108:3>
The fine is
&dollar;100 for a subsequent offence.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-005#X109:3>
Repeat offenders are taken to court.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-005#X110:3>
The spokesman also suggested the following anti-mosquito measures:

<ICE-SIN:W2C-005#X111:3>
* CHANGE the water in flower vases and plant bowls every two days
and scrub the interior of the vessels to remove mosquito eggs;

<ICE-SIN:W2C-005#X112:3>
AVOID using flower pot plates.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-005#X113:3>
If they are used, empty the plates every two days.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-005#X114:3>
MAKE sure pails, basins and watering cans do not collect rain
water.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-005#X115:3>
CLEAR the grounds of any unwanted containers that can collect rain
water.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-005#X116:3>
REPAIR or remove defective roof gutters and keep them clear of
leaves sand and silt.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-005#X117:3>
CLEAR leaves from drains and use non-perforated gully traps; and
FILL up tree holes with cement. </X> </I>
