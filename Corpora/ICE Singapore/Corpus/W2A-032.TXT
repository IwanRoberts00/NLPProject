<h> Introduction </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-032#4:1>
A CIM system typically consists of a series of functional areas such
as design, process planning, manufacturing, testing, inspection etc.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-032#5:1>
The computer aided tools in each module are different in nature and
are difficult to integrate with each other.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-032#6:1>
To develop an efficient and robust CIM system, an effective
information link must be established between each module so as to provide
data exchange and information sharing.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-032#7:1>
History of PDES After the first release of IGES Initial Graphics
Exchange Specification) in 1980, numerous attempts at providing flexible, yet
stable method of CAD data transfer have resulted in a number of
specifications.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-032#8:1>
Some of these have become national standards.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-032#9:1>
IGES as an initial graphics specification has suffered from some of
the drawbacks such as file size too large, poor design format, limited scope
for expansion etc.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-032#10:1>
Nevertheless, IGES is a widely accepted standard and is supported by
most of the CAD vendors and has established itself as the international de
facto standard during the past ten years.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-032#11:1>
Some other standards that were derived from IGES, but have been
modified to overcome some of it's shortcomings and to accommodate particular
application areas, such as VDA-FS for the car manufacturing industry in
Germany and SET for the aerospace industry in Europe, are also widely
adopted.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-032#12:1>
The existence of too many standards resulted in a call for a unified
approach capable of accommodating all types of product information.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-032#13:1>
A few main efforts were initiated almost simultaneously, namely the
Product Data Exchange Specification ( POES) by US National Bureau of
Standards, which has changed it's name to National Institute of Science and
Technology ( NIST); the CAD interface project ( CAD*I) in Europe; the Product
Definition Data Interface ( PDDI) by the US Air Force and the Standard for
the Exchange of Product Data ( STEP) by the International Standard
Organisation ( ISO).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-032#14:1>
In late 1988, the ISO committee responsible for the STEP agreed to
adopt the first version of PDES as a draft of STEP, resulting in a single,
international standard - PDES/SEP.In late 1989, the committee responsible had
agreed to change the acronym for PDES: PDES no longer stands for " Product
Data Exchange Specification" but rather stands for " Product Data Exchange
us;ng STEP".

<ICE-SIN:W2A-032#15:1>
<h> What is PDES </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-032#16:1>
PDES can be viewed from several different viewpoints and is actually
a compilation of many different activities.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-032#17:1>
PDES is a standards development process.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-032#18:1>
PDES is also a combination of different technologies.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-032#19:1>
PDES is also an activity contributed by several different people from
many companies and organisations ( 1).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-032#20:1>
The change of the PDES acronym has made PDES more of an activity
rather than a US-specified standard.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-032#21:1>
As a enterprise product standard, PDES has as its objective the
ability to define all the information needed throughout the life cycle of a
product, such as to exchange geometry data between different CAD/CAM systems,
to provide translation of information from CAD systems down to other
functional areas such as process planning, manufacturing, testing etc.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-032#22:1>
The fundamental mission of PDES is to provide a specification that is
able to integrate information from all different CIM modules, so as to
develop a fully automated CIM system.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-032#23:1>
<h> Introduction to IGES </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-032#24:1>
IGES is the current de facto international standard for product data
exchange and is partially supported by many CAD systems.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-032#25:1>
Since the release in 1980 of the first version of IGES, the PDES/STEP
Organisation has added increasingly sophisticated data construct to the IGES
specification.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-032#26:1>
As the capabilities of IGES have been expanded to accommodate more
applications, the specification has become more pliable.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-032#27:1>
Some of these change have added to the complexity and ambiguity of
the specification, and this has increased the difficulty of using IGES
effectively.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-032#28:1>
Since IGES is a widely supported standard format for CAD graphics and
text information, most vendors of CAD systems supply pre and post-processors
to translate their native system files into and out of IGES, respectively.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-032#29:1>
The IGES pre-processor will translate CAD data from the system native
data-base into the IGES neutral file format and vice versa for the IGES
postprocessor.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-032#30:1>
During the translation, some errors may occur, party due to the IGES
processors supported by the CAD vendors and party due to the poor design
format of IGES.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-032#31:1>
Since the first release in 1980, the IGES committee had added
complicated entity constructs into IGES so as to accommodate more application
areas.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-032#32:1>
There is a long list of entities available for the CAD vendors to
choose from.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-032#33:1>
No CAD vendors will support the entire IGES specification.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-032#34:1>
As a result, each CAD vendor will implement a different subset of
specification, and this have increased the difficulty in the entity mapping
during the translation.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-032#35:1>
<h> IGES File Structure </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-032#36:1>
IGES divides its physical file into five sections; namely, the START
section, the GLOBAL section, the DIECTORY ENTRY section, the PARAMETER DATA
section and the TERMINATE section.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-032#37:1>
The START Section contains user readable information.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-032#38:1>
The GLOBAL section contains information describing sending system and
data required by the receiving system etc.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-032#39:1>
DIRECTORY ENTRY and PARAMETER DATA section will handle entity
information and the TERMINATE section records the number of cards of each
section.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-032#40:1>
From the file structure described above, we can see that, for each
entity to be contained in the IGES file, at least three cards are needed.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-032#41:1>
Two in the Directory section and one in the Parameter section, and
this will take up at least 240 bytes.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-032#42:1>
As a result, the entire file size can be as large as ten times the
drawing file it translated.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-032#43:1>
Another drawback for entity stored in this way is that, for any
program to read or write to the IGES file it must look for the information
about each entity in two places.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-032#44:1>
<h> IGES Drawbacks </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-032#45:1>
As we have mentioned, every CAD vendors support different subsets of
entity and represent their system data using different IGES entities.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-032#46:1>
As a result, the same information may be data encoded in different
ways.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-032#47:1>
The net result is, information is lost during the translation between
dissimilar entity sets.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-032#48:1>
In addition to the existing pre- and post-processor, there must
therefore have another program that has the ability to recognize the data
encoded in both the CAD systems.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-032#49:1>
This program is known as the flavouring program.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-032#50:1>
The main purpose of the flavouring program is to maintain the data
integrity translated between different CAD systems.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-032#51:1>
The problem is, we can have as many flavouring program as the number
of CAD systems that are exchanging data.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-032#52:1>
The fundamental idea of introducing neutral file formats is to
eliminate the number of translators required in a CAD systems exchange
network.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-032#53:1>
Using direct translation method, for N CAD systems exchange network,
we require N*(N-1) translators, whereas for neutral file method the number of
translator required is only 2N.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-032#54:1>
The requirement of flavouring has reintroduced the problems of
developing additional N*(N-l) flavouring program.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-032#55:1>
Although some of the errors can be overcome by the flavouring
programs, there are always errors that cannot be solved, there are always
entities that you can express in one format but which has no representation
in another format.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-032#56:1>
When translating such data across the CAD systems, one can only try
to maintain its visuality but not the functionality.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-032#57:1>
All this sum up the major drawback of-IGES, it is designed to carry
geometry data but not product information.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-032#58:1>
Same data may represent different information, although in the
converse, the same information may be data encoded differently, but that
doesn't matter.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-032#59:1>
So, if we have a specification that is capable of carrying the
product information rather than just the geometry data, most of the problems
encounted above can be solved.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-032#60:1>
The ideal product data exchange standard must not only describe
geometry data but also information such as product material, product
features, tolerances, configuration management and other information that are
required for producing this product in a CIM environment.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-032#61:1>
With all this in mind, and to overcome the error associated with
IGES, in 1984, the IGES committee set up a research project called PDES with
a long-range objective of developing and using a rigorous methodology for the
creation of product exchange specification.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-032#62:1>
The methodology was to be used in developing a new product exchange
standard that would avoid the identified weaknesses of IGES [ 3] - - and this
newly introduced standard is known as PDES.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-032#63:1>
The Product Data Exchange Specification ( PDES) is a data description
and format standard under development for the exchange and sharing all data
needed to fully describe a product and its manufacturing processes.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-032#64:1>
[ 1] The difficulties associated with the transfer of data rather
than information between each CIM module are that the meaning of data might
be misunderstood by other functional modules and human interpretation is
needed at every stage to help in editing of data.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-032#65:1>
PDES has eliminated this problem by first defining all information to
be carried in each application area.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-032#66:1>
<h> The Three Layer Architecture of PDES </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-032#67:1>
PDES adopts a three layer schema architecture which is similar to the
database structure.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-032#68:1>
The external , or the very top layer of the structure is known as the
application layer, which define - the information that is expected to be
encountered in each application area and model by using the PDES specified
modeling language EXPRESS .

<ICE-SIN:W2A-032#69:1>
The fundamental idea of PDES is that there is a common set of data
that describes all kinds of products, and this product definition is
independent of specific computer environment and implementation.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-032#70:1>
Thee common set of product definition data model, such as geometry,
topology, tolerances, form feature, layered electrical product, finite
element modeling, material, presentation etc.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-032#71:1>
form the second layer of PDES.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-032#72:1>
This middle layer, or in PDES term, the logical layer is the focus
point for integrating all information model defined in the top layer.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-032#73:1>
The bottom layer, or the internal layer is the physical layer.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-032#74:1>
The physical layer has the PDES data represented in the Physical file
format, or in a database format.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-032#75:1>
This layer also defines a set of rules for the mapping of the logical
layer product definition data model into the physical file format.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-032#76:1>
The separation of PDES standard is very important as it allows the
user to concentrate on the information, or the " meaning" of their data
without worrying the physical representation of the data in the neutral file.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-032#77:1>
Implementation Level of PDES For any standard to be practical, it
must be implementable.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-032#78:1>
For PDES, there are four different levels of implementation.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-032#79:1>
The top two levels are for exchange of product data and the lower two
levels are for product information sharing.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-032#80:1>
The first level of implementation is the passive file exchange.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-032#81:1>
This layer is similar to - IGES, which defines the conversion of CAD
system's native database into the PDES neutral physical file and vice versa.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-032#82:1>
The second level is known as the active file exchange.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-032#83:1>
This is characterized by the concept of a working form of data which
is used by access software to translate to and from a neutral sequential file
format and to provide DBMS-like data structure navigational capabilities.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-032#84:1>
The third implementation level of PDES is the shared database layer.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-032#85:1>
This level has a logical description of all the product data and a
physical implementation of this information in a database format.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-032#86:1>
Application can then reach into that database and pull out the
information they need to drive their specific application [ 1].

<ICE-SIN:W2A-032#87:1>
Level 4 is the Integrated Product knowledge base.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-032#88:1>
A knowledge base implementation of PDES is represented by using an
object oriented approach to the storage of product definition data where the
product data and methods to operate on that product data are stored together
as an object in an object-oriented database.[l] The first attempt to draft
the PDES application protocols is being made by PDES Inc.
