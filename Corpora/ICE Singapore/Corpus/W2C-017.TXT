<h> Clan's recreation club woos ex-Perfect Match participants </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2C-017#3:1>
A HOKKIEN district clan has found a novel way to boost its membership
- by recruiting young men and women who had taken part in the Singapore
Broadcasting Corporation's television dating game show, Perfect Match.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-017#4:1>
The youth arm of the Lam Ann Association formed the Perfect Match
Recreation Club in 1990 to bring together the game show participants.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-017#5:1>
It now has 300 members.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-017#6:1>
And, true to the objective of the game show, it can boast of one
married couple and four others heading up the aisle.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-017#7:1>
Lam Ann's spokesman, Ms Linda Chia said that the idea for the club,
for singles only, came about after the clan sent some of its younger members
to be part of the studio audience in the show.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-017#8:1>
SBC's Perfect Match, which ended in April after a six-year run,
paired up singles who were brave enough to be teased on national television.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-017#9:1>
It did not confine its matchmaking efforts to contestants.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-017#10:1>
Every week, two organisations sent a team of 3 men or women to form
the studio audience, who also stood a chance to win prizes.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-017#11:1>
The 30 clansmen who took part in the show later met other
participants and decided to keep in touch by forming the club, and the clan
chipped in with money and the premises.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-017#12:1>
They also printed recruitment leaflets which were distributed to
those who took part in subsequent Perfect Match programmes.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-017#13:1>
Ms Chia said that the club's aim was to let members socialise,
adding: " We are also trying to respond to the Government's call to young
people to get married earlier."

<ICE-SIN:W2C-017#14:1>
Besides getting members together or traditional clan activities such
as Lunar New Year celebrations, the club also organises cycling trips and
picnics.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-017#15:1>
Two club members, sales executive Vincent Teo and clerk Anna Lim,
both 23, tied the knot two weeks ago.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-017#16:1>
Mr Teo said he met his wife on a Perfect Match programme three years
ago and decided to join the club for recreation and to keep in touch with
other participants.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-017#17:1>
While the fresh approach to recruitment has won them many young
members, not all club members, however, have ancestors who originated from
the Nan-an region in southern China.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-017#18:1>
Asked if this contradicted the clan's founding principle, Mr Teo Kek
Yeng, head of the clan's youth roup, said that the clan has always accepted
any Chinese, regardless of their ancestry, as members.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-017#19:1>
But the clan does insist that only those whose ancestors were from
Nan-an can stand for election to the executive committee.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-017#20:1>
He added that few people today knew or cared about where their
ancestors came from.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-017#21:1>
" Society has changed, most Chinese are born in Singapore, and we
will have to make suitable adjustments and not keep insisting on such
locality links," he said. </I>

<h> Hainan clan leader eyes top post in umbrella body </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2C-017#23:2>
By Wang Hui Ling

<ICE-SIN:W2C-017#24:2>
THE man involved in a leadership tussle at the Singapore Hainan
Society is now making a bid for power in the umbrella body.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-017#25:2>
Dental surgeon Cheng Tim Jiam, 54, said that he and about 30 others
would contest the elections at the annual general meeting of the Kiung Chow
Hwee Kuan at NTUC Conference Hall on Sunday.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-017#26:2>
The Kiung Chow Hwee Kuan, headed by lawyer Wee Tin Teck, 71, serves
as an umbrella body for about 60 Hainanese clans here.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-017#27:2>
It is based in Beach Road and has assets totalling
&dollar;15 million.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-017#28:2>
Two factions Dr Cheng's and another - are now claiming leadership of
the 37-year-old Singapore Hainan Society.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-017#29:2>
Both are now waiting for a ruling from the Registry of Societies.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-017#30:2>
Disclosing his plans to The Straits Times last night, Dr Cheng said
that his group will vie for the 3 seats on the executive committee of the
Kiung Chow Hwee Kuan.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-017#31:2>
This will be the second time that the Young Turks, as they are
dubbed, are planning to take over the reins of the umbrella body.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-017#32:2>
They failed in their last bid in 1991.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-017#33:2>
Asked if he might be viewed as a troublemaker, given his involvement
in a number of disputes, Dr Cheng said: " Whatever I do, there will be people
who will say it is good and people who will say it is bad.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-017#34:2>
What's important is that I know what I am doing. "

<ICE-SIN:W2C-017#35:2>
He said that he is taking an active part in clan activities as he
fears that with falling membership, clans would be made irrelevant if they do
not modernise soon.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-017#36:2>
" If there are people who are willing to pay
&dollar;200,000 to join a golf club, why is it that clans, with their low admission
fees cannot attract more people to join?

<ICE-SIN:W2C-017#37:2>
" There must be something wrong with it somewhere, right?"

<ICE-SIN:W2C-017#38:2>
Dr Cheng said this is why he is leading young professionals into the
clans and introducing new activities such as golf tournaments.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-017#39:2>
One of his supporters, Mr Edwin Chan, said that they are not out to
oppose for the sake of opposing.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-017#40:2>
" Our main objective here is to effect change in the clans.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-017#41:2>
How many organisations have the same leader for 25 years?" And what
if they lose the elections again on Sunday?

<ICE-SIN:W2C-017#42:2>
Dr Cheng said he does not rule out trying again.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-017#43:2>
He said that with the interest sparked by the controversy, he has no
doubt that more Hainanese would step forward and join him in serving the
community.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-017#44:2>
Contacted yesterday, Mr Lee Ah Fong, Kiung Chow Hwee Kuan's
vice-president, said in Mandarin: " We will definitely be contesting the
elections. "

<ICE-SIN:W2C-017#45:2>
He said that it was possible that Mr Wee, who has been at the helm of
the clan for 25 years, might contest the election, but did not wish to give
further details. </I>

<h> Rebel leader fails again to lead Hainan clan body </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2C-017#47:3>
By Wang Hui Ling

<ICE-SIN:W2C-017#48:3>
REBEL Hainanese clan leader Cheng Tim Jiam yesterday failed in his
second attempt to enter the executive committee of Singapore's biggest
Hainanese clan.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-017#49:3>
Only 87 members of the Kiung Chow Hwee Kuan, the umbrella body for
about 60 Hainanese clans, voted for him, about 100 fewer than for the last
person voted into the 3-member policy-making committee.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-017#50:3>
Only three clansmen in Dr Cheng's slate of candidates were voted in.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-017#51:3>
But they were also supported by the incumbent clan leaders.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-017#52:3>
The other 30 seats were also won by the incumbents' nominees.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-017#53:3>
The clan's president of 25 years, lawyer Wee Tin Teck, 71, did not
contest.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-017#54:3>
He had said that he wanted to make way for younger leaders.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-017#55:3>
The committee, which will sit for a two-year term, will elect its new
president and other office-bearers soon.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-017#56:3>
Dr Chau Sik Ting, 53, a People's Action Party MP for Thomson from
1980 to 1984, polled the most votes out of a possible 449.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-017#57:3>
He was nominated by both factions.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-017#58:3>
The talk is that he could be the next president of the clan which
holds assets worth
&dollar;15 million.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-017#59:3>
It is based at Beach Road.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-017#60:3>
Dr Cheng, 54, a dental surgeon, admitted defeat but expressed
satisfaction that Dr Chau had been elected as a committee member.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-017#61:3>
" Change is coming about...so that is good.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-017#62:3>
I do not have to be in," he said Dr Cheng and his group of
professionals - dubbed the Young Turks - have been embroiled in several
leadership disputes in recent years.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-017#63:3>
They and their rivals in a leadership tussle over the Singapore
Hainan.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-017#64:3>
Society are now awaiting a ruling from the Registry of Societies.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-017#65:3>
Dr Cheng s group made its first bid to join the Kiung Chow Hwee
Kuan's executive committee in 1991.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-017#66:3>
The police had to be called in when the meeting became rowdy.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-017#67:3>
In contrast, yesterday's voting at the Singapore Conference Hall
proceeded peacefully.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-017#68:3>
But some clansmen, who are also Singapore Hainan Society members,
were heard complaining about Dr Cheng's role in the society's leadership
dispute.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-017#69:3>
Three Cisco officers hired by the clan were seen walking about.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-017#70:3>
Also present were two photographers hired by Dr Cheng's supporters to
make sure that " everyone is accountable for what they say and do", said one
of the supporters.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-017#71:3>
Many of the elected members interviewed said that they were not
against Dr Cheng's claim that clans should be modernised to attract younger
members.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-017#72:3>
But lawyer Lee Chin Seon, 36, who was elected into the executive
committee, felt that Dr Cheng wanted to change things too drastically.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-017#73:3>
" Change is necessary but it must be evolutionary, not
revolutionary," he said.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-017#74:3>
Said Mr Lee: " The older generation wants continuity.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-017#75:3>
While the young have different aspirations from the old, they must
still co-ordinate and learn the ropes from the older generation." </I>

<h> Satisfying a sweet tooth for gold </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2C-017#77:4>
<h> Upmarket eateries offering gold-speckled cakes </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2C-017#78:4>
By Cephah Tan

<ICE-SIN:W2C-017#79:4>
FANCY eating gilded food?

<ICE-SIN:W2C-017#80:4>
You can do so now at some upmarket eateries without causing too big a
hole either in the pocket or in the teeth the gold simply melts in the mouth.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-017#81:4>
Gossamer-thin petals of gold, which crumble at the slightest touch,
are being dabbed onto dainty cakes and pastries to add a sparkling and rich
finish.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-017#82:4>
Eating gold is fashionable in Japan and Thailand, where it is
considered to be a gift from god only the very rich can afford to eat it.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-017#83:4>
It is supposed to make complexions glow like gold.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-017#84:4>
But it has yet to catch on here although the Ministry of the
Environment has said that eating gold is harmless.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-017#85:4>
At the Pan Pacific Hotel a customer can order the Empress Pigeon Tea
with Quail Eggs and Morelle, a soup served in a bowl and covered with gold
foil, for special functions only.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-017#86:4>
One serving sets you back by
&dollar;24. 

<ICE-SIN:W2C-017#87:4>
The Pan Pacific and the Shangri-La offer the hosts of functions
held at their hotels chocolates and pastries garnished with gold flakes.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-017#88:4>
Mr Darryl Wee, Pan Pacific's public relations manager, said that the
gold foil comes from Thailand and each piece weighs only 0.25 g S & P
restaurants, a food chain in Thailand, is also putting gold on sweets,
cookies and cakes at a Thai food fair held at the Concorde Hotel this month.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-017#89:4>
Miss Chandnibha Suriyong, S & P vice-president, said: " In Thailand,
gold is used to decorate desserts for festivals and celebrations like
weddings.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-017#90:4>
It is used traditionally in desserts for royalty."

<ICE-SIN:W2C-017#91:4>
She added: " Gold, being very expensive and beautiful, is believed to
be a gift from god.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-017#92:4>
In the past, only the very rich could afford to eat it.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-017#93:4>
It is supposed to increase your longevity and make your complexion
glow like gold." Gold was also used in early medicines in Europe.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-017#94:4>
The Italians took to eating it during the Renaissance, followed later
by the Moghul rulers and maharajahs of India.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-017#95:4>
Thais still use gold as a medicine while the Japanese put it in sake
during festivals to signify prosperity.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-017#96:4>
Miss Kelly Long, Concorde's marketing communications manager, said
gold-decorated desserts are common and affordable in Thailand.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-017#97:4>
Gold foil and leaves cost between 6 1/2 cents and 32 cents, she said.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-017#98:4>
At Fauchon, a French cafeteria in Isetan Scotts, gold flakes are used
on a few fanciful cakes.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-017#99:4>
A dab of gold is worth 50 cents, said executive chef Steven Fong.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-017#100:4>
This pushes the price of its chocolate mousse cupcake to
&dollar;5 a piece.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-017#101:4>
But one can hardly taste it, overwhelmed as it is by the rich
chocolate.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-017#102:4>
Mr Fong said: " Of course it's real gold.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-017#103:4>
One small stack of gold foil costs
&dollar;200. </I>

By the time Raffles Institution student Kevin Siew, 16, had his

Kevin, a Secondary 4 student, is one of the 1700 RI boys taking part
