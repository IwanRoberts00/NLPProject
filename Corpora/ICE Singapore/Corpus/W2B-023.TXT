<h> TRILOBITE LARVAE </h>

by Peter K L Ng and H S Yong

<ICE-SIN:W2B-023#3:1>
Biologists recognise a term called NEOTENY, which is used to describe
an animal which retains all its juvenile features even when it has grown to a
large size and is sexually mature.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-023#4:1>
In layman's language, neotenic animals can perhaps be described as "
mature overgrown babies"!

<ICE-SIN:W2B-023#5:1>
In the insect world, one of the most dramatic and best known cases of
neoteny occurs in some members of the beetle family Lycidae.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-023#6:1>
Beetles ( Order Coleoptera) are the most diverse living things on this
planet, and there are more beetle species than any other group of animals.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-023#7:1>
It is thus not surprising that some beetles have adopted a very
peculiar strategy to survive in the extremely competitive rainforest.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-023#8:1>
It is well known that beetle larvae and pupae look very different from
the adult.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-023#9:1>
More often than not, they look more like worms or caterpillars,
although all possess the six segmented legs characteristic of insects.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-023#10:1>
They are also exceptionally diverse in their habits and habitats.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-023#11:1>
The males of all members of the family Lycidae are typical beetles,
possessing the hardened outer wings, membranous inner wings for flying and
all the general features.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-023#12:1>
The females of some lycids on the other hand, never seem to " grow
up".

<ICE-SIN:W2B-023#13:1>
That is, unlike males, these female larvae keep on growing without
metamorphosising to pupae and then to the normal adult.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-023#14:1>
They also become very large ( up to 6 cm long), sexually mature and
capable of reproducing!

<ICE-SIN:W2B-023#15:1>
The male of these lycid beetles on the other hand, are very small - -
only about 0.5 cm in body length.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-023#16:1>
In one of the most extraordinary copulations in nature, a male mates
with a female totally different from himself and some 12 times his size (
many more times in bulk)!

<ICE-SIN:W2B-023#17:1>
The female lycid larvae have in fact been known to biologists for
almost 160 years, when these larvae were made known to science by an English
entomologist named Perty.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-023#18:1>
The animal was so unusual that Perty described it as 'larva
singularis' - - the remarkable larva.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-023#19:1>
His colleagues meanwhile, did him the dubious honour by calling the
animals 'Perty's larvae'!

<ICE-SIN:W2B-023#20:1>
While the six legs of 'Perty's larva' necessitated its classification
in the Class Insecta, little else could be deduced.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-023#21:1>
Flightless, large and peculiar in almost every respect, even studies
of live animals imported into Europe defied attempts by biologists to better
understand them.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-023#22:1>
While entomologists were confident that it was the larva of some
insect, probably a beetle, no one could confidently associate it with any
known family.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-023#23:1>
Amidst this intrigue, some English entomologists coined the name 'trilobite
larvae' for these animals, alluding to the general similarity of some kinds
of these larvae to the extinct and totally unrelated trilobites.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-023#24:1>
This name has remained in popular use ever since.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-023#25:1>
Only in 1924 was the mystery of the 'trilobite larvae' solved - - by
a Swede explorer, Eric Mjoberg.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-023#26:1>
Mjoberg showed that 'trilobite larvae' were all females, and were
capable of reproducing.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-023#27:1>
Some of his animals actually laid eggs, which he recorded as being as
large as sago grains and up to 400 in number.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-023#28:1>
He postulated that the male might well be something very different
from the female and perhaps even capable of flight.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-023#29:1>
After nearly 2 years of doggedly trying to find the males in the
rainforests of Sarawak, Borneo, he finally managed to observe and collect
them, using the female 'trilobite larvae' as bait!

<ICE-SIN:W2B-023#30:1>
And as expected, males were typical beetles.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-023#31:1>
In Malaysia, we have seen large, non-feeding females perched almost
motionless on branches and dead wood, apparently waiting for prospective
mates in the middle of the night.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-023#32:1>
So it seems, at least in some Lycidae, males and females adopt
completely different modes of life to maximise their chances of survival in
the forest.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-023#33:1>
For females to be large makes a lot of biological sense - - for one
thing, she can produce more eggs.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-023#34:1>
These lycids have gone to the extreme to achieve this, with their
females retaining their larval features all the way to adulthood.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-023#35:1>
Not only have they grown very large in comparison to the males, they
have also lost the ability to fly, directing all their energies, presumably,
to reproduction instead.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-023#36:1>
'Trilobite larvae' are known from Southeast Asia, including Malaysia
and Singapore, and come in many shapes, forms and sizes.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-023#37:1>
The taxonomy and identification of 'trilobite larvae' are very
difficult.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-023#38:1>
One of the better known species is the appropriately named Duliticola
paradoxa, the one studied in detail by Mjoberg.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-023#39:1>
Published sources indicate that at least two other beetle families
have larviform females, the Lampyridae ( fireflies) and Drilidae.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-023#40:1>
In these two families however, the females metamorphose from normal
pupae into flightless adults which lack both sets of wings.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-023#41:1>
They are hence not truly neotenic.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-023#42:1>
The lycid 'trilobite larvae' do not undergo a pupal stage and have a
different and more 'larval' body form.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-023#43:1>
Large and flightless, 'trilobite larvae' defend themselves by
secreting a whitish foul-tasting fluid to discourage potential predators.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-023#44:1>
Their heads are telescopic, and can be protruded during feeding or
retracted if disturbed.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-023#45:1>
At the rear of their body, they have a suction pad.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-023#46:1>
As far as is known, they feed on rotten wood ( according to Mjoberg),
or more likely, on small animals or fungi in the wood.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-023#47:1>
Mjoberg reported that he could keep his animals alive for many months
with a continuous supply of rotten wood and " ...bathed twice a day"!

<ICE-SIN:W2B-023#48:1>
We have found specimens on fungi ( Basidiomycetes), and it is
possible that some species are fungivores.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-023#49:1>
The suction pad of a 'trilobite larva' is able to attach itself to
smooth and rough surfaces, and helps anchor the animal.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-023#50:1>
Certainly, Mjoberg reported collecting many from among rotten wood.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-023#51:1>
We have observed some of them apparently grazing on the fungal
growths on rotting wood.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-023#52:1>
Many of our specimens have been found on rotting hardwoods.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-023#53:1>
The wood is damp and termites are not very common.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-023#54:1>
They are mainly nocturnal, and usually move about only after dusk.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-023#55:1>
They have however, been observed moving around during the day on
grass or mossy patches after rain or during the wetter parts of the year.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-023#56:1>
There has also been a report that they feed on land snails ( D H
Murphy and Kwan Hun, " An Eye on Nature", Maruzen Publishers, 1983); using
their suction pads to attach themselves onto the shell of their prey, their
telescopic heads pursuing the snail even if it retreated into its shell.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-023#57:1>
If this is indeed the case, then the feeding habits of 'trilobite
larvae' will parallel those of the better known glow-worms, the larvae of
fireflies.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-023#58:1>
In the laboratory however, we have not been able to persuade our
captive specimens to eat snails of the genera Dyakia or Achatina.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-023#59:1>
'Paddy' Murphy has kindly informed one of us ( P Ng) that the large
specimen on which he based his report on was collected from Peninsular
Malaysia many years ago, and the collector had informed him that it fed on
snails.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-023#60:1>
The specimen ( not the same one figured in his book) was brought back
to Malaysia by the collector.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-023#61:1>
On retrospect, he suggests that the snail-feeding animal might well
have been a very large glow-worm and not a true 'trilobite larva' ( pers
comm).

<ICE-SIN:W2B-023#62:1>
The same can perhaps be said for another report that the larvae of
some Lycidae have " ...along the margins...a string of luminous organs which
flash on and off, signaling in a predetermined code.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-023#63:1>
The light produced is weak, cold light...

<ICE-SIN:W2B-023#64:1>
The larvae are predaceous and are found on foliage and tree trunks in
open woods".

<ICE-SIN:W2B-023#65:1>
( Vincent Tung, " Common Malaysian Beetles", Malaysian Nature
Handbooks, Longman, 1983:, p.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-023#66:1>
80).

<ICE-SIN:W2B-023#67:1>
We have never observed bioluminescence in 'trilobite larvae' from
Singapore or Malaysia, and neither are there any reports of this.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-023#68:1>
These observations are more likely to refer to the Lampyridae!

<ICE-SIN:W2B-023#69:1>
Neither are 'trilobite larvae' known to be carnivorous, which
lampyrids are known to be.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-023#70:1>
'Trilobite larvae ' , in our experience, prefer more wooded, forested
areas, and do not climb more than two metres above the ground, and not on
leaves.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-023#71:1>
A 'trilobite larva' is very dorso-ventrally flattened.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-023#72:1>
The ventral surface of Duliticola, showing the six legs which
identify it as an insect.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-023#73:1>
The body form of Duliticola, with its armour-plate-like segments and
projections, superficially resembles that of the ancient and now extinct
marine trilobites, hence its popular name.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-023#74:1>
'Trilobite larvae' are popular collector's items, and are much sought
after by coleopterists.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-023#75:1>
Their secretive habits however, render them generally uncommon in
Malaysia and Singapore.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-023#76:1>
There is however, still a great deal we do not know about lycid
beetles and their 'trilobite larvae'.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-023#77:1>
Matching the many kinds of beetle-like males is very difficult unless
they have been observed copulating.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-023#78:1>
This involves a great deal of field work and perseverance.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-023#79:1>
As a result, a stable taxonomy for 'trilobite larvae' is still not
possible.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-023#80:1>
Many of the questions posed by Mjoberg remain unanswered.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-023#81:1>
In many ways 'trilobite larvae' are still very much a mystery, as
they were over 160 years ago.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-023#82:1>
Another form for 'trilobite larva' ( Duliticola sp.) from Mount
Kinabalu in Sabah.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-023#83:1>
It can be encountered during the day at the Park Headquarters.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-023#84:1>
The males of 'trilobite larvae' are typical beetles in every respect,
in sharp contrast to their neotenic females.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-023#85:1>
These two species of unidentified male lycid beatles resemble the
known males of 'trilobite larvae'.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-023#86:1>
It must be emphasised that not all female lycid beetles are 'trilobite
larvae' - - many are typical beatles too.

<h> Shark Tagging: The Way Forward </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-023#92:2>
Now to species: You are most likely to catch bonnethead or nurse
sharks, both of which are strong, but of little danger to life and limb.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-023#93:2>
The bonnethead is like a baby hammerhead.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-023#94:2>
It averages about 7-lbs and grows just into double figures.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-023#95:2>
It has proper " sharky" teeth and can give you a serious bite if you
are lax enough to let it.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-023#96:2>
The nurse has an incredibly muscular torso and even a twenty pounder
cannot be held straight.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-023#97:2>
It has tiny eyes, relies on smell for locating baits and has
crushing, rather than cutting teeth.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-023#98:2>
It looks somewhat like a bull huss.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-023#99:2>
An average nurse shark would be about thirty pounds.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-023#100:2>
A big one, maybe seventy pounds up.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-023#101:2>
They grow to over 200 lbs.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-023#102:2>
You may also locate lemon and black tip sharks, though in all the
years, I have fished there, I have only had one in daylight hours.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-023#103:2>
They are certainly out in force at night and are true oceanic,
aggressive sharks.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-023#104:2>
A 100 pounder would easily be capable of removing a hand but as you
are on heavy mono traces, any meeting with one will be brief.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-023#105:2>
Should you use wire traces, you will get less pickups in daylight
than mono but will stay attached to both blacktips and lemons.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-023#106:2>
Much of the time, you can actually see the sharks working their way
up a scent trail as they track down on a bait.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-023#107:2>
This makes it exciting and the bigger nurse sharks throw up clouds
of coral sand as they rip into a legered bait.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-023#108:2>
The largest I have boated would be about 90-lbs but I had a couple
of carp guys out last April/May who took seven in a day to an estimated
125-lbs, using standard carp gear and baitrunners.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-023#109:2>
Assuming you are now all gung-ho for a session, let me give you a
breakdown of a spring trip.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-023#110:2>
Packages are best worked out in twos.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-023#111:2>
Two to a room, hire car and boat break costs down to bearable
amounts. </I>
