<ICE-SIN:S1A-051#37:1:B>
So they have to submit fresh plans

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-051#45:1:B>
Can lah but it is like <unclear> word </unclear>

<ICE-SIN:S1A-051#> Question why you treat it like dirt right

<ICE-SIN:S1A-051#46:1:B>
Why never comply this and that

<ICE-SIN:S1A-051#47:1:B>
Why take so long to comply so many extensions

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-051#48:1:A>
Comply to what

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-051#49:1:B>
To FSB

<ICE-SIN:S1A-051#50:1:B>
Actually actually the other departments all cleared know except for
this fire safety

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-051#51:1:A>
Oh dear

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-051#52:1:B>
Suit the client lah

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-051#53:1:A>
Why

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-051#54:1:B>
Don't want to provide this don't want to provide that and all
that

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-051#55:1:A>
Don't want

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-051#56:1:B>
But actually the the the architect

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-051#57:1:A>
<unclear> word </unclear>

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-051#58:1:B>
But the architect has the you know should convince them that
this was things are required what

<ICE-SIN:S1A-051#59:1:B>
But the FSB also very terrible

<ICE-SIN:S1A-051#60:1:B>
They always come up with new requirement

<ICE-SIN:S1A-051#61:1:B>
Some submit ha oh this this thing not proper

<ICE-SIN:S1A-051#62:1:B>
We've never comply

<ICE-SIN:S1A-051#63:1:B>
Either that or like they come up with new er regulation and then
then

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-051#64:1:A>
No no like

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-051#65:1:B>
They they point out new mistakes kind of thing you know

<ICE-SIN:S1A-051#66:1:B>
So unfair lah

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-051#67:1:A>
She must be utterly <unclear> word </unclear>

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-051#68:1:B>
But she's appealing

<ICE-SIN:S1A-051#69:1:B>
Ya lah better to appeal 'cause it'll be ridiculous you know

<ICE-SIN:S1A-051#70:1:B>
Imagine you send the same drawings to the other departments and the
other departments approve already

<ICE-SIN:S1A-051#71:1:B>
I approve already

<ICE-SIN:S1A-051#72:1:B>
What you send in for what

<ICE-SIN:S1A-051#73:1:B>
Get what I mean

<ICE-SIN:S1A-051#74:1:B>
But for the sake of this main department right the building
controller you have to submit to the other the other departments for for
clearance

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-051#75:1:A>
Quite terrible you know

<ICE-SIN:S1A-051#76:1:A>
If I I would feel very stressed

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-051#77:1:B>
Tan Li Liang

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-051#78:1:A>
ya

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-051#79:1:B>
Before he left said I make sure this project will be left in
shit

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-051#80:1:A>
Ha

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-051#81:1:B>
He said I make sure this project will be left in shit

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-051#82:1:A>
And then

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-051#83:1:B>
And true enough

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-051#84:1:A>
So evil

<ICE-SIN:S1A-051#85:1:A>
You know sabotage is so disgusting <unclear> word </unclear>

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-051#86:1:B>
No it's not sabotage

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-051#87:1:A>
Then

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-051#88:1:B>
Then I ask her ask him you know

<ICE-SIN:S1A-051#89:1:B>
Did she know not

<ICE-SIN:S1A-051#90:1:B>
Did she know about all this you know right things didn't comply
right

<ICE-SIN:S1A-051#91:1:B>
Ya

<ICE-SIN:S1A-051#92:1:B>
Did you tell June

<ICE-SIN:S1A-051#93:1:B>
He said oh she should know what

<ICE-SIN:S1A-051#94:1:B>
Common sense what

<ICE-SIN:S1A-051#95:1:B>
It's quite true lah actually

<ICE-SIN:S1A-051#96:1:B>
But the FSB called uh highlighted to him but he didn't

<ICE-SIN:S1A-051#97:1:B>
June

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-051#98:1:A>
Ya

<ICE-SIN:S1A-051#99:1:A>
So that is not fair you see

<ICE-SIN:S1A-051#100:1:A>
Think if I were June I'll be very angry with him

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-051#101:1:B>
But June was like fighting for the project

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-051#102:1:A>
Ya

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-051#103:1:B>
Like you know feel so jealous that he's taking care of the
whole thing

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-051#104:1:A>
But was he taking care of the whole thing

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-051#105:1:B>
He ya ah ah

<ICE-SIN:S1A-051#106:1:B>
Then she just took you know help a small part of so she was like
fighting for the project

<ICE-SIN:S1A-051#107:1:B>
So

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-051#108:1:A>
Well I guess now that you get what you want is difficult

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-051#109:1:B>
She cried you know

<ICE-SIN:S1A-051#110:1:B>
When I saw the letter

<ICE-SIN:S1A-051#111:1:B>
Aye got such thing one

<ICE-SIN:S1A-051#112:1:B>
Uh disapprove

<ICE-SIN:S1A-051#113:1:B>
Notice of disapproval never seen before

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-051#114:1:A>
So what did they disapprove

<ICE-SIN:S1A-051#115:1:A>
No safe

<ICE-SIN:S1A-051#116:1:A>
No fire exit is it

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-051#117:1:B>
Just say that you didn't comply to requirements lor

<ICE-SIN:S1A-051#118:1:B>
So

<ICE-SIN:S1A-051#119:1:B>
No because okay for the BCD's part lah okay they will say you have
to get clearance from all this departments before you submit your plans

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-051#120:1:A>
Ya

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-051#121:1:B>
By this by a specified date you see

<ICE-SIN:S1A-051#122:1:B>
So if it you know once the due date is near you have to ask for
extension right

<ICE-SIN:S1A-051#123:1:B>
So they still can't get clearance from FSB because all the because
already submit to BCD

<ICE-SIN:S1A-051#124:1:B>
You have to get clearance from all the other departments

<ICE-SIN:S1A-051#125:1:B>
But this BC this FSB still didn't give clearance you see

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-051#126:1:A>
Ya

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-051#127:1:B>
So they have ask for extension five times already

<ICE-SIN:S1A-051#128:1:B>
So eventually this BC they say cannot so long already must
disapprove

<ICE-SIN:S1A-051#129:1:B>
No more extension

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-051#130:1:A>
Then how now re-draw everything from scratch

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-051#131:1:B>
Can submit old plans lah but it is like submitting the old
drawings same old thing

<ICE-SIN:S1A-051#132:1:B>
Just that you know I mean except for this er FSB new require I
mean FSB requirement lah

<ICE-SIN:S1A-051#133:1:B>
Know what I mean she's very terrible lah

<ICE-SIN:S1A-051#134:1:B>
Then her face will be involve and all that right

<ICE-SIN:S1A-051#135:1:B>
Then delay the construction

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-051#136:1:A>
And then

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-051#137:1:B>
Then delay the

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-051#138:1:A>
company will make loss

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-051#139:1:B>
Then the temper temporary occupation permit also like delay

<ICE-SIN:S1A-051#140:1:B>
People cannot make use of the building even though it is completed

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-051#141:1:A>
Yes

<ICE-SIN:S1A-051#142:1:A>
You mean the building completed already

<ICE-SIN:S1A-051#143:1:A>
No right

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-051#144:1:B>
No but if they delay this process I see by the time the
building com completed already

<ICE-SIN:S1A-051#145:1:B>
But they still cannot get the TOP you know what I mean

<ICE-SIN:S1A-051#146:1:B>
Because each time it is like

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-051#147:1:A>
So unfair

<ICE-SIN:S1A-051#148:1:A>
And so how she feel about it

<ICE-SIN:S1A-051#149:1:A>
She's still very stressed

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-051#150:1:B>
Of course

<ICE-SIN:S1A-051#151:1:B>
Today she too she took MC today

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-051#152:1:A>

<ICE-SIN:S1A-051#153:1:A>

<ICE-SIN:S1A-051#164:1:B>
Then I said I think she got to resort to rape

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-051#165:1:A>
Why

<ICE-SIN:S1A-051#166:1:A>

<ICE-SIN:S1A-051#167:1:A>
