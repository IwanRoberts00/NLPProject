<ICE-SIN:S2B-036#1:1:A>
The dream team and they're all back

<ICE-SIN:S2B-036#2:1:A>
Sundram Moorthy often described as the most skilful player on the
field

<ICE-SIN:S2B-036#3:1:A>
Malek Awak the most hardworking player and asset to any team often
called the dynamo

<ICE-SIN:S2B-036#4:1:A>
Abbas Saad play maker Alistar Edwards also back with a nice personal
touch in more ways than one

<ICE-SIN:S2B-036#5:1:A>
And of course Singapore's golden boy Fandi Ahmad everyone's model
player

<ICE-SIN:S2B-036#6:1:A>
I spoke with Patrick Ang the general manager and the man who did the
wheeling and dealing to make this team possible

<ICE-SIN:S2B-036#7:1:A>
And their presence is certainly felt in the team

<ICE-SIN:S2B-036#8:1:A>
Well sentiments are quite mixed

<ICE-SIN:S2B-036#9:1:A>
For the older they're glad to be back for reasons personal or
otherwise

<ICE-SIN:S2B-036#10:1:A>
For the younger ones is un understandable if they feel they are a
little overlooked

<ICE-SIN:S2B-036#11:1:A>
But whatever it is the team spirit and morale is quite high

<ICE-SIN:S2B-036#12:1:A>
Well definitely better than last year which everyone remembered as
the dooms year for local soccer

<ICE-SIN:S2B-036#13:1:A>
Not the least of which the Singapore team was relegated to division
two

<ICE-SIN:S2B-036#14:1:A>
I spoke to the present coach P N Sivaji but he told me that he
rather not make any comments as he wanted to fully concentrate on training
the boys at this point in time

<ICE-SIN:S2B-036#15:1:A>
However the problems that plagued local soccer last year were not
unfamiliar

<ICE-SIN:S2B-036#16:1:A>
Coaches went in and out there was mismanagement of the team and
lack of commitment from the players themselves

<ICE-SIN:S2B-036#17:1:A>
As a result games were lost

<ICE-SIN:S2B-036#18:1:A>
Many fans turned away from soccer and the Kallang roar died

<ICE-SIN:S2B-036#19:1:A>
But today many have come back because of the new team and the
exciting prospects of winning the Malaysia Cup

<ICE-SIN:S2B-036#20:1:A>
But former skipper of the National team Terry Pamanathan feels that
having good players might not always mean winning the game

<ICE-SIN:S2B-036#21:1:A>
So is this then a sign of better things to come for Singapore
soccer </I>

Hi I'm Lisa

<ICE-SIN:S2B-036#23:2:B>
Today Hey Singapore goes to Seletar

<ICE-SIN:S2B-036#24:2:B>
The name Seletar was said to have come from the term Orang Seletar
which refers to the natives which Raffles encountered when he first landed in
Singapore

<ICE-SIN:S2B-036#25:2:B>
In 1925 the HMS Pergasus completed a most successful and historic
voyage of discovery for the Royal British Airforce or RAF

<ICE-SIN:S2B-036#26:2:B>
The pioneers of the Pergasus had found the size of the future
airbase thus starting a long association of the RAF with Singapore

<ICE-SIN:S2B-036#27:2:B>
And these men were part of the first squadron flying halfway around
the world

<ICE-SIN:S2B-036#28:2:B>
Clearing the site posed difficulties including having to do the
overhauling in the open

<ICE-SIN:S2B-036#29:2:B>
But even before being officially declared open the airbase was
already part of the greatest flight in history in 1928 during the Far East
flight

<ICE-SIN:S2B-036#30:2:B>
Upon its completion the airbase welcomed celebrities and aviation
access to their grounds

<ICE-SIN:S2B-036#31:2:B>
Sir Charles <unclear> word </unclear> Smith considered one of the
great pilots of all time landed in Seletar in 1930 as part of his
record-breaking flight from England to Australia

<ICE-SIN:S2B-036#32:2:B>
Another familiar name is Britain's Amy Johnson the first woman to
make the solo flight from Britain to Australia

<ICE-SIN:S2B-036#33:2:B>
In May 1930 the weather-beaten Gypsy Moth arrived safely in Seletar
despite battling the monsoon rains

<ICE-SIN:S2B-036#34:2:B>
Other celebrities to also use the base included one of silver
screen's leading men Douglas Fairbank Senior

<ICE-SIN:S2B-036#35:2:B>
A frequent visitor was English playwright actor composer director
Sir Noel Howard

<ICE-SIN:S2B-036#36:2:B>
Many aviation adventurers and different aircraft models had made
their way or passed through Seletar

<ICE-SIN:S2B-036#37:2:B>
But the giant silver <unclear> word </unclear> plane Sunderland was
the longest serving RAF aircraft in Singapore

<ICE-SIN:S2B-036#38:2:B>
The <unclear> word </unclear> torpedo bomber was also included in
the number 36 squadron and the Burmese incident further saw the need to beef
up the squadron

<ICE-SIN:S2B-036#39:2:B>
Thus the inclusion of the <unclear> word </unclear> torpedo bombers

<ICE-SIN:S2B-036#40:2:B>
The peace time task of the air base came to an abrupt end with the
onset of World War II

<ICE-SIN:S2B-036#41:2:B>
Recognising the strength of the base the Japanese navy quickly
restored Seletar making it fully operational and named it Seletar <unclear>
word </unclear>

<ICE-SIN:S2B-036#42:2:B>
The need for ammunition caused the Japanese to ship any available
metal to Japan including the removal of metal girdles off these hangars

<ICE-SIN:S2B-036#43:2:B>
Seletar Ville continued its peaceful operations after the war

<ICE-SIN:S2B-036#44:2:B>
The Countess Mounbatten of Burma paid a special visit and so did
the Duke and Duchess of <unclear> word </unclear> during the royal tour of
the Far East in 1952

<ICE-SIN:S2B-036#45:2:B>
The air base has gone through several phases since its completion
and with the establishment of the SAF Training Centre in June 1965 it marked
the gradual end of RAF in Singapore

<ICE-SIN:S2B-036#46:2:B>
Initially operations at the air base were peaceful in nature
including conducting of surveys metereological flights and escorting VIPs

<ICE-SIN:S2B-036#47:2:B>
However incidents like the Burmese rebellion in the 1930s showed
the need to modernise the air base

<ICE-SIN:S2B-036#48:2:B>
This led to the housing of local employees and later on the RAF
officers in an area known as Seletar Ville

<ICE-SIN:S2B-036#49:2:B>
But where is Seletar Ville currently

<ICE-SIN:S2B-036#50:2:B>
To find out join us after the break

<ICE-SIN:S2B-036#51:2:B>
That in turn led to a residential area affectionately known as
Seletar Ville found within Seletar Camp Complex

<ICE-SIN:S2B-036#52:2:B>
Jalan Kayu was named after Mr C E Woods the principal works and
building officer-in-charge of the original air base

<ICE-SIN:S2B-036#53:2:B>
But due to his request the Malay equivalent of his name is used
instead

<ICE-SIN:S2B-036#54:2:B>
Another thing that tells you 'you're here' are these guarded gates
but what lies beyond them

<ICE-SIN:S2B-036#55:2:B>
Let's find out

<ICE-SIN:S2B-036#56:2:B>
Entering the complex is like venturing into another country
altogether

<ICE-SIN:S2B-036#57:2:B>
Not only are there no tall buildings to block your view there is no
heavy traffic

<ICE-SIN:S2B-036#58:2:B>
Thus ensuring minimum noise and air pollution

<ICE-SIN:S2B-036#59:2:B>
What would greet you are decades old terraces and semi-detached
houses built ages ago greenery and narrow winding roads

<ICE-SIN:S2B-036#60:2:B>
Take a look at some of these landmarks that should surely take you
back in time

<ICE-SIN:S2B-036#61:2:B>
Seletar Ville still uses most of its original road names and just
rattling these names often would make it seem like you are in England instead
of Singapore

<ICE-SIN:S2B-036#62:2:B>
Most of the houses here are unique in their own ways

<ICE-SIN:S2B-036#63:2:B>
And residents are able to add their personal touch to the
surroundings as shown by the cute and artistic letter boxes here

<ICE-SIN:S2B-036#64:2:B>
The plants are definitely an interesting sight which we will
explore later but I was curious to find out more about the lifestyle here

<ICE-SIN:S2B-036#65:2:B>
So I went to see April and Jerry <unclear> word </unclear>
residents here since twenty years ago

<ICE-SIN:S2B-036#66:2:B>
The West camp is where you will find Seletar Airport which is run
by the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore and it is from here that all air
traffic is controlled

<ICE-SIN:S2B-036#67:2:B>
From this relatively new tower you can actually see some old
landmark particularly the old tower

<ICE-SIN:S2B-036#68:2:B>
Some of the old landmarks within Seletar air base dated as far back
as the early days of the RAF

<ICE-SIN:S2B-036#69:2:B>
Unfortunately the original structures had to make way due to the
ravages of World War II and later further expansion

<ICE-SIN:S2B-036#70:2:B>
The airport has had a few towers built since 1928

<ICE-SIN:S2B-036#71:2:B>
The current change is due to the ever expanding role of the airport
that sees the need for new facilities to be accommodated

<ICE-SIN:S2B-036#72:2:B>
Thus the old tower had to be abandoned but recognising its
historical value the tower though deserted still remains

<ICE-SIN:S2B-036#73:2:B>
And taking over its air control responsibilities is this new tower
the highest structure in Seletar

<ICE-SIN:S2B-036#74:2:B>
New hangars have been built to replace the old ones

<ICE-SIN:S2B-036#75:2:B>
Although the Japanese removed the metal girdles off the original
hangars to ship to Japan the infrastructures remained

<ICE-SIN:S2B-036#76:2:B>
And those who wish to know when the structures were built there is
the date for all to see a year after the air base was officially opened

<ICE-SIN:S2B-036#77:2:B>
The war wiped out almost everything and within the air field a
little evidence remains to show just how bad

<ICE-SIN:S2B-036#78:2:B>
This thick metal door has holes all over caused by bomb shrapnels

<ICE-SIN:S2B-036#79:2:B>
Yes the force and hear of the shrapnels melted parts of the door
flying is one of the favourite past-times of the residents here

<ICE-SIN:S2B-036#80:2:B>
However its role as the base for general aviation has taken up most
of the air space

<ICE-SIN:S2B-036#81:2:B>
Sir <unclear> word </unclear> governor of Straits Settlement in
1930 was quoted to have said that Singapore would become one of the largest
and most important airports in the world

<ICE-SIN:S2B-036#82:2:B>
Based on what Seletar Airport alone has turned out he would have
been proud of his prediction

<ICE-SIN:S2B-036#83:2:B>
The services within the airfield varies aircrafts like the C130 as
technician Mike explains are always on standby for possible refueling of
planes or cargo shipments

<ICE-SIN:S2B-036#84:2:B>
Seletar's peace time task of 60 years ago are still maintained

<ICE-SIN:S2B-036#85:2:B>
When the need arise <unclear> word </unclear> or aircrafts for
medical attention and evacuation like this helicopter could be counted on in
cases of emergency

<ICE-SIN:S2B-036#86:2:B>
Seletar Airport runs commercial and non-commercial flights

<ICE-SIN:S2B-036#87:2:B>
Although the two make up only a small percentage of the total air
movement the flight ranges from regular commuter operations to Tioman daily
cargo flights to Batam and bringing in fresh seafood for restaurants here

<ICE-SIN:S2B-036#88:2:B>
If the original air base saw the likes of screen idols kings and
ministers the new passenger terminal also has a list of whos's who

<ICE-SIN:S2B-036#89:2:B>
Many personalities have chosen Seletar Airport for its privacy

<ICE-SIN:S2B-036#90:2:B>
These included mega stars like Jackie Chan Jean Claude Van-Damme
Cindy Crawford and many more

<ICE-SIN:S2B-036#91:2:B>
Maintenance is still very much a part of the airport's services

<ICE-SIN:S2B-036#92:2:B>
The availability of facilities in Seletar sees aircrafts from
around the region seeking maintenance at the air base

<ICE-SIN:S2B-036#93:2:B>
With about 9000 air movements per month the air port definitely has
its hands full and contributing greatly to the functioning

<ICE-SIN:S2B-036#94:2:B>
And safety of aviation at Seletar are a group of people working
behind the scene

<ICE-SIN:S2B-036#95:2:B>
Just like any other airport the air traffic controllers work round
the clock to ensure smooth and safe air traffic flow

<ICE-SIN:S2B-036#96:2:B>
Although Seletar Airport today functions as a general aviation
airport the majority of its flying movements still come from flying training

<ICE-SIN:S2B-036#97:2:B>
It also continues to be a place for young Singaporeans to realise
their dreams of learning how to fly

<ICE-SIN:S2B-036#98:2:B>
The wings of Singapore continues to soar with the increasing
interest of aviation shown by the current crop of youngsters

<ICE-SIN:S2B-036#99:2:B>
And all their interest began in 1928 when the Republic of Singapore
Flying Club was founded

<ICE-SIN:S2B-036#100:2:B>
Although it cost quite a bit to get your flying license it sure
beat swinging a golf club

<ICE-SIN:S2B-036#101:2:B>
Dennis tell us more

<ICE-SIN:S2B-036#102:2:B>
Well that's a sum that most students can't afford

<ICE-SIN:S2B-036#103:2:B>
But if they meet the pre-requisites the Youth Flying Club is the
place for such young aspiring pilots

<ICE-SIN:S2B-036#104:2:B>
Now apart from the Singapore Flying Club there is the Youth Flying
Club which also organises activities for schools mainly flying training

<ICE-SIN:S2B-036#105:2:B>
And of course I am not going to miss that for the world

<ICE-SIN:S2B-036#106:2:B>
Okay I'll close the door

<ICE-SIN:S2B-036#107:2:B>
And off we go to check out what more Seletar has to offer

<ICE-SIN:S2B-036#108:2:B>
This time taking a bird's eye view

<ICE-SIN:S2B-036#109:2:B>
During the flight I was given a few flying tips and learned more
on Seletar

<ICE-SIN:S2B-036#110:2:B>
When the RAF first decided on Seletar mangrove swamps have to be
filled in hills removed and rubber trees cut down

<ICE-SIN:S2B-036#111:2:B>
As Seletar continues to play its role as general aviation venue
for the region there has been an increasing need for space

<ICE-SIN:S2B-036#112:2:B>
Thus the area around it has been reclaimed to provide land for any
further expansion plans

<ICE-SIN:S2B-036#113:2:B>
Just imagine that in Seletar alone there are three golf courses to
be found

<ICE-SIN:S2B-036#114:2:B>
There is the Seletar Base Golf Course just next to the runway the
Seletar Country Club Golf Course and just next to Yishun New Town the Orchid
Golf Course

<ICE-SIN:S2B-036#115:2:B>
Imagine the sight seen by the crew of the Far East Flight who
recced Seletar back in 1927

<ICE-SIN:S2B-036#116:2:B>
Now instead of swamp land cultivated trees lined the residential
areas of Ang Mo Kio and Yishun

<ICE-SIN:S2B-036#117:2:B>
And here it's a little trivial did you know that the fresh water
at Lower Seletar reservoir is separated from the sea water by the stretch of
land of Yishun Avenue One

<ICE-SIN:S2B-036#118:2:B>
Interesting ah

<ICE-SIN:S2B-036#119:2:B>
Well with some help from Major Leong I had a chance to pilot the
plane for seven whole seconds <X>

<ICE-SIN:S2B-036#X120:2:B>
It was thrilling for me but I can't say the same for my very
worried camera man With the spectacular view of the Singapore oological
Gardens from the air we decided it was time to take the plane back home It
was definitely a flight that will be etched in my mind for a long long time
Seletar has managed to retain the unmistakable beauty of its natural
surrounding which hopefully will be preserved I am Lisa from Hey Singapore
good night </X> </I>
