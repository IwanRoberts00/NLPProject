<I>

<ICE-SIN:W2F-013#1:1>
<h> IN SPIRIT BOUND </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2F-013#2:1>
THERE she stood now.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-013#3:1>
Typical of her profession erect and proud.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-013#4:1>
It would seem that nothing could lick that military spirit which her
years in uniform had built into her system.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-013#5:1>
It was this indomitable spirit which had attracted me and many others
to look longingly at her majestic tall figure - made all the more beautiful
by her waist length hair.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-013#6:1>
Her very dark complexion - very dark even for one of Indian ethnic
origin - threw a mystic air around her.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-013#7:1>
But what made one swoon - if indeed one may swoon over a woman - was
the flash of pearly white teeth that she generously bestowed on her friends.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-013#8:1>
Now after a year of widowhood the enchanting smile seemed to have gone
forever.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-013#9:1>
It was as if she had aged a decade this past year.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-013#10:1>
Yet it seemed but yesterday that I had first seen her in her father's
house - romping around without a care, filling the air with peals of rippling
laughter, as if she were a child who had forgotten to grow up.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-013#11:1>
From where I stood I could see her; engrossed in her chosen task -
pulling out tuft after tuft of grass from her beloved's grave.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-013#12:1>
She only paused in her task and got to her feet to see where her
little one had wandered to.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-013#13:1>
As I watched silently, her eyes wandered around to see who else had
come to this most desolate of places.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-013#14:1>
I lamented that those once beautiful eyes had lost their lustre and
in their place was a hopelessness that I had hoped I would never have to see
- ever.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-013#15:1>
Yet she carried herself with the dignity and pride of the army woman
that she was.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-013#16:1>
Standing tall and erect, her dark figure a stark contrast to the
widow's white saree that custom had condemned her to wear forever.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-013#17:1>
Kalyani's search ended when her eyes met her daughter's.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-013#18:1>
Little Leela looked up from where she was intently studying a
tombstone.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-013#19:1>
She flashed a smile, exactly the smile that her mother had used to
brighten many of my mornings, and pointed her chubby finger at a flower.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-013#20:1>
In this most desolate of places neither the flower nor even the
child's smile brought the slightest cheer - at least not to my beloved
Kalyani.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-013#21:1>
The sluggish hot breeze brought with it the stench of rotting flesh
from somewhere - probably from the stream nearby, where rain water had
collected after it had sunk into the ground and washed particles of rotting
flesh.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-013#22:1>
The merging of the smell of the numerous frangipani flowers and the
sickly sweet smell of the rotting corpses added an air of sadness that
dominated the atmosphere - that even the child's smile failed to add any
cheer.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-013#23:1>
I spotted him first, as he picked his way gingerly over the
gravestones towards where Kalyani was now, back at her toil, pulling the
tufts of grass that offended her Raj's grave.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-013#24:1>
As I had expected, it was Narayan, Kalyani's self-appointed guardian.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-013#25:1>
He had as usual been following her since the tragedy in her life.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-013#26:1>
This he had been doing, sometimes with her knowledge, but mostly
without.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-013#27:1>
I had noticed her showing resentment at this silent escort service at
first, but she had obviously learnt to be comfortable with the lanky,
uninvited companion.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-013#28:1>
Lately I noticed that she even missed him a little on the few
occasions when he was not around.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-013#29:1>
I caught her looking around as if casually trying to hide the anxiety
she felt at discovering that he was not around.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-013#30:1>
He lived on the same floor as she did, so it was easy for him to
follow her at short notice, which he did, keeping at a respectable distance.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-013#31:1>
Of course he had to protect her reputation.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-013#32:1>
The Indian community, even in Singapore, was quick to form
conclusions and condemn 'misbehaviour'.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-013#33:1>
Professional 'radios' would have concocted fantastic stories about
them.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-013#34:1>
The stories would have begun by reports that they had been seen
together, and developed to reports that they were living together and
concluded that this had been going on even when her husband had been alive!

<ICE-SIN:W2F-013#35:1>
" You stupid bastard!" I heard her curse, and winced.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-013#36:1>
" Why did you leave me?

<ICE-SIN:W2F-013#37:1>
See how lost I am without you?

<ICE-SIN:W2F-013#38:1>
You rushed into my life and before I had enough of you, rushed out.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-013#39:1>
I warned you not to drink and drive, didn't I?" Tears flowed
unrestrainedly and rained down on the desolate grave.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-013#40:1>
I was able to feel just how anguished she was at this time.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-013#41:1>
So close had I been to her that even her thoughts were not secret
from me.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-013#42:1>
I remembered her favourite song, " When I see tears in your eyes,
Kannamma my heart bleeds for you" and my heart bled for her.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-013#43:1>
She was now beating the grave in despair and screaming unspeakable
curses at her one-time beloved, who had so suddenly left her all alone.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-013#44:1>
" You promised to send me first, didn't you?" She screamed, not
caring who heard her.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-013#45:1>
" He wouldn't approve," said a voice gently.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-013#46:1>
She did not look behind since she knew who it was.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-013#47:1>
" He would want you to remember him but not lament his loss forever.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-013#48:1>
If you remember, he always loved laughter.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-013#49:1>
He would want you to be happy always."

<ICE-SIN:W2F-013#50:1>
" You and your bloody advice!" She turned to him with a snarl, " He
was your best friend, wasn't he?

<ICE-SIN:W2F-013#51:1>
Why didn't you stop him from drinking?

<ICE-SIN:W2F-013#52:1>
No, you drank with him.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-013#53:1>
Now you console his widow!

<ICE-SIN:W2F-013#54:1>
Get lost and allow me at least the freedom to cry as much as I like."
Rational people do not like to see grown men cry, and I was a rational person
and I did not like to see Narayan cry.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-013#55:1>
And he was sobbing like a baby.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-013#56:1>
My God, what a scene!

<ICE-SIN:W2F-013#57:1>
I would have liked to have been spared this heart-rending drama.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-013#58:1>
But who can escape his Karma...?

<ICE-SIN:W2F-013#59:1>
Suddenly I felt a dig in my ribs.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-013#60:1>
Naturally I knew who it was.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-013#61:1>
It was that little pest, Radha, again.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-013#62:1>
I had met her in my wanderings, and had taken an instant liking to
her and she to me.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-013#63:1>
In fact she had adopted me as her elder brother.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-013#64:1>
She was a childish 18-year old, full of life and mischief.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-013#65:1>
She had an irritating habit of sneaking up on me and doing suddenly
something to attract attention.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-013#66:1>
This time it was an irritating tickle in the ribs.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-013#67:1>
At other times she would creep up quietly and yell, " Boo!", At
another time she would clap loudly in my ear and at another...oh heck!

<ICE-SIN:W2F-013#68:1>
The dig in the ribs was followed by the usual warm hug by way of an
apology.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-013#69:1>
She took one look at the scene and winked understandingly.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-013#70:1>
Then she took my hand in hers and gripped it gently, and through this
expressed her sympathy, regret, happiness, sorrow everything!

<ICE-SIN:W2F-013#71:1>
I gripped her hand in return to express my thanks at her perfect
understanding of this delicate situation.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-013#72:1>
By now, Kalyani had taken a grip of herself and was wiping away her
tears.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-013#73:1>
Narayan was off on one of his philosophical trips.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-013#74:1>
He was explaining to her about the impermanence of life, the
unreality of death et cetera.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-013#75:1>
The bored look on her face left no doubt as to her complete
disinterest in the subject.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-013#76:1>
I remembered that Narayan was clumsy in everything - in action and in
speech.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-013#77:1>
Moreover he never did know when and what to say.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-013#78:1>
As though to wave aside his philosophising, she asked with typical
military abruptness, " Why do you keep following me around?" Obviously
annoyed at the sudden interruption to his well-meaning advice, and caught
off-guard by the direct question, he stood stunned for a whole minute; and
then taking a grip on himself asked quietly, " You don't know?" " Oh I know.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-013#79:1>
You probably feel guilty about your friend's death so you have
appointed yourself as my guardian.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-013#80:1>
Well, I've got news for you, I don't need a guardian and what's more,
if you continue with this absurd practice, you are going to ruin my
reputation, and yours too.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-013#81:1>
People will begin to talk - if they haven't already started to."

<ICE-SIN:W2F-013#82:1>
" I don't care what people talk!"

<ICE-SIN:W2F-013#83:1>
" But I do!"

<ICE-SIN:W2F-013#84:1>
He looked down.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-013#85:1>
" I love you," he blurted out.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-013#86:1>
Now it was her turn to be shocked.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-013#87:1>
For a while she was silent - too shocked to speak.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-013#88:1>
Then she threw up her head and laughed, " That's all I need!"

<ICE-SIN:W2F-013#89:1>
Then as abruptly as she had begun she stopped and looked pitifully at
him.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-013#90:1>
" Oh no!

<ICE-SIN:W2F-013#91:1>
You don't," she murmured.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-013#92:1>
" You are not going in that direction.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-013#93:1>
I don't want another sin on my soul."

<ICE-SIN:W2F-013#94:1>
" What do you mean?"

<ICE-SIN:W2F-013#95:1>
" You pity me...right?

<ICE-SIN:W2F-013#96:1>
You feel guilty, right?

<ICE-SIN:W2F-013#97:1>
You think it is an act of duty, right?" she sneered.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-013#98:1>
" That too," he answered boldly.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-013#99:1>
" I'll tell you the reason if you stop yelling and listen to me."

<ICE-SIN:W2F-013#100:1>
" Huh!

<ICE-SIN:W2F-013#101:1>
Do you imagine you know what love is?

<ICE-SIN:W2F-013#102:1>
Do you know how much my Raj loved me?

<ICE-SIN:W2F-013#103:1>
Do you imagine you could ever replace him?

<ICE-SIN:W2F-013#104:1>
Do you think I could ever love you or anyone, for that matter, as
much as I loved him?"

<ICE-SIN:W2F-013#105:1>
" Well are you going to listen to me or not?"

<ICE-SIN:W2F-013#106:1>
" I'm listening."

<ICE-SIN:W2F-013#107:1>
" I was very close to Raj."

<ICE-SIN:W2F-013#108:1>
" I know.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-013#109:1>
He told me.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-013#110:1>
Sometimes I even felt that my place in his heart was second to
yours, that you were my competition."

<ICE-SIN:W2F-013#111:1>
" For goodness sake stop interrupting and let me finish."

<ICE-SIN:W2F-013#112:1>
" Okay."

<ICE-SIN:W2F-013#113:1>
" I want to become him.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-013#114:1>
I want to be dead in his place.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-013#115:1>
I want to be husband to his wife and father to his child.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-013#116:1>
I want to do everything that he would do if he were alive.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-013#117:1>
I want to live as he would have lived...in his house...with you and
Leela.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-013#118:1>
Let us believe that he is still in our lives.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-013#119:1>
Let...me...be...him."

<ICE-SIN:W2F-013#120:1>
" Is this practical?" she sighed unbelievingly.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-013#121:1>
" Of course not.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-013#122:1>
But it can happen if you agree.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-013#123:1>
I will change my name to Raj - at least for you.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-013#124:1>
Leela will call me Appa.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-013#125:1>
No one else matters.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-013#126:1>
In our own little home and world Raj will be alive.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-013#127:1>
In fact I have been pretending to be him this past year.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-013#128:1>
I can't accept his absence either."

<ICE-SIN:W2F-013#129:1>
" You must have gone mad!" I saw Kalyani shake her head
incredulously but the expression on his face showed that he meant every word
he said.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-013#130:1>
At least I was convinced of his sincerity.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-013#131:1>
" This is wild," she managed to blurt out.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-013#132:1>
No one saw the child fall.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-013#133:1>
I screamed of course and so did Radha.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-013#134:1>
Naturally no one heard us.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-013#135:1>
But they heard Leela scream as she fell into the half-dug grave.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-013#136:1>
Swift as a flash Narayan leapt in.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-013#137:1>
She was not hurt, just a little shaken.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-013#138:1>
As I had expected Narayan made a fuss, not insincerely, but a little
exaggeratedly.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-013#139:1>
Kalyani pressed her precious little one to her breast.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-013#140:1>
Choosing this great opportunity Narayan put his great hairy arm
around her.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-013#141:1>
As I had expected the Indian widow within her objected and she
recoiled at his touch; as though touched by something repulsive or, I
wondered, was it because she felt a sense of guilt at having allowed herself
to be touched by a man other than her husband.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-013#142:1>
" Oh no you don't!" she snapped.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-013#143:1>
Narayan withdrew his hand reluctantly and wiped the tears from his
eyes with his sleeves.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-013#144:1>
" Look, I wanted to lay bare my feelings to you whether you believe
me or not, and I have.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-013#145:1>
I wanted to say this in front of Raj and I have.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-013#146:1>
I know you believe that I am sincere.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-013#147:1>
I am also convinced that you probably agree that I am right and that
Raj would have liked this to happen.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-013#148:1>
I knew him - he would have done the same in my place.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-013#149:1>
He knew that I would have wanted it."

<ICE-SIN:W2F-013#150:1>
He paused to see her reaction. <X>

<ICE-SIN:W2F-013#X151:1>
There was none.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-013#X152:1>
" Just what metal is she made of?" asked an annoyed Radha.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-013#X153:1>
I shrugged my shoulders as I had no satisfactory answer for her.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-013#X154:1>
" If he had spoken to a stone it would have melted."

<ICE-SIN:W2F-013#X155:1>
" Tradition my dear, tradition.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-013#X156:1>
Five thousand years of it.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-013#X157:1>
Our people's blood is infused with it," I said in despair. </X>
</I>
