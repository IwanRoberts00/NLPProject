<h> <bold> Voting on Mr Goh </bold> </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-010#2:1>
<p> THE <w> opposition's </w> plaintive cry that the Government is being
<quote> unfair </quote> in calling for election on Aug 31 is a little rich,
and wondrously naive.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-010#3:1>
Although called at far shorter notice than previous general elections,
which were usually preceded by months of official hints that polls were in
the offing, the coming election is hardly a total surprise either.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-010#4:1>
Ever since Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong began his community visits in
June and the <w> Government's </w> subsequent announcement of a three-month
bonus for civil servants, speculation has been rife that an early election
was on the way.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-010#5:1>
When he confirmed early this month that this would indeed be the case,
the only question left was when exactly, with many observers noting that the
present was ideal from the <w> Government's </w> point of view.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-010#6:1>
The main opposition parties themselves came very close to the
mark with their guesses: Potong Pasir MP and Singapore Democratic Party
leader Chiam See Tong predicted a September poll, while Workers' Party leader
JB Jeyaretnam told everyone that it would definitely be before Nov 10, when
the 1986 prohibition on his running for Parliament ends. </sent> </p>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-010#7:1>
<p> But knowing that an election is imminent and being ready for it are
totally different things.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-010#8:1>
And the opposition, despite Mr Chiam and Jeyaretnam declaring
that their parties are prepared, is hardly in the same league as the ruling
People's Action Party, which National Development Minister S Dhanabalan
accurately likened to a machine which is always ready, needing only a press
of the button to run. </sent>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-010#9:1>
As we noted in an Insight feature early this month, the opposition is
still running the last lap - although dozing might be a more appropriate
description for most of the parties.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-010#10:1>
Most are not even parties, except in name, being mainly the personal
vehicles for a few individuals with pretensions to being politicians but who
are nowhere to be seen or heard between elections.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-010#11:1>
The SDP and the WP are active throughout the year, but only in a very
limited way since each party has a mere 100 or so active members - some of
them working strictly for themselves.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-010#12:1>
They are not the stuff to frighten a government, let alone form one.
</p>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-010#13:1>
<p> None of the opposition expects to do the latter, of course.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-010#14:1>
All they can hope for is to increase their share of the votes and
possibly win a few seats.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-010#15:1>
Obviously, their prospects would improve if the election were much
later.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-010#16:1>
It gives them time to find candidates, pick the most promising
constituencies to contest and in general crank themselves up to run.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-010#17:1>
And, doubtless, they hope for a change in the public mood which would
favour them.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-010#18:1>
As the WP's Dr Lee Siew Choh noted in the Insight article,
Singapore voters <X> <quote> only want an opposition when things are bad.
If the economy is booming and everyone is happy, it will be tough for
us </quote> </X> .

<ICE-SIN:W2E-010#19:1>
It certainly looks as if it will be, which is unfortunate for the
opposition, but hardly the fault of the Government.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-010#20:1>
Like democratic governments everywhere else, the Government here
naturally seeks to maximise its own votes, not help the opposition, which
must win their own votes. </p>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-010#21:1>
<p> Their best chances probably lie with Singaporeans who want an opposition
for the sake of opposition because there is really nothing at the moment to
exercise voters against the Government.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-010#22:1>
Besides having the economy in his favour, Mr Goh has also defused
what could have been issues for the opposition by his announcement of
measures to help average and lower-income Singaporeans in respect of health
care, housing and education, his agreeing to non-transferable certificates
of entitlement for cars and promises to expand higher education
opportunities.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-010#23:1>
For ordinary Singaporeans, the real issue is really Mr Goh himself,
as heir to Mr Lee Kuan Yew, but going one better in terms not only of a more
open, relaxed style, but of kinder, gentler policies as well.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-010#24:1>
Although the opposition has already dismissed the changes as
cosmetic, we strongly suspect that Singaporeans know better - and will render
their verdict accordingly on Aug 31. </p> </I>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-010#25:2>
<h> <bold> Make every vote count </bold> </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-010#26:2>
<p> THERE could not have been a more poignant backdrop for Nomination Day in
Singapore than the crisis that threatened at one stage to tip the Soviet
Union over the brink and into all-out civil war.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-010#27:2>
It was entirely fortuitous, of course, that Mikhail Gorbachev's
ouster from power by a motley cabal of generals and communist hardliners
should have come just as Singaporeans began the democratic process of picking
their own leaders for the next five years.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-010#28:2>
Be that as it may, it cannot but bode ill for a Singapore ever
vulnerable to the winds of change if its citizens were to ignore this
dramatic reminder of just how uncertain, and perilous, life could be.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-010#29:2>
Education Minister Tony Tan put his finger on it when, speaking on
Tuesday night, he urged Singaporeans to ponder, in the cold, clear light of
the cataclysmic events that have shaken the world, just what the General
Election ought to be about.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-010#30:2>
The answer, even if he did not supply it, is obvious: The election
should be about returning, unambiguously, the party that can best see
Singapore through the years ahead.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-010#31:2>
If the tragedy that is unfolding in Moscow, and its impact on peace
and stability across the globe, is too distant an event to jolt the mind into
focusing on the crucial choice to he made on Aug 31, then consider one that
occurred closer home just two weeks ago - the joint exercise by Malaysian and
Indonesian troops barely 20 km north of the Causeway.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-010#32:2>
What more do Singaporeans need to grasp the importance of having in
place a strong government which enjoys their unequivocal confidence and which
can stand up to provocations or tests they do not want but will come anyway?
</p>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-010#33:2>
<p> All this is not scare-mongering.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-010#34:2>
It is about making a sober choice.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-010#35:2>
It is about seeing things in perspective.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-010#36:2>
And it is about lifting one's sight above the sound and simulated
fury of an election with no real issues in order to focus on the one that
truly matters - whether Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong deserves a clear mandate
to carry out the programmes outlined in The Next Lap and carry on with his
open, more consultative style of government.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-010#37:2>
He has put himself on the line and asked Singaporeans for
endorsement in the most direct of terms: " Every vote you withhold from me,
or worse, you give to the opposition, will weaken my political position after
the election. Every vote that you give me will increase my political
weight, in the country, in the Cabinet and in Parliament. I seek
every vote. I need every vote that you can give me."

<ICE-SIN:W2E-010#38:2>
There are no two ways about it. </p>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-010#39:2>
<p> What makes this general election different from previous ones is that
here is the prime minister of the day asking not just for his government to
be returned but also that he be given a clear signal in the form of increased
votes for the People's Action Party, that Singaporeans want him and what he
stands for.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-010#40:2>
The distinction is important.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-010#41:2>
A mandate for the PAP to govern is, well, a foregone conclusion
because Singaporeans, by and large, do not want any other.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-010#42:2>
What Mr Goh needs is the endorsement of more votes as that will give
him the legitimacy to say he has carried the country with him.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-010#43:2>
This is what representative government boils down to.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-010#44:2>
He is now the issue. </p>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-010#45:2>

<p> While there is little doubt that he, as a leader and as a person, is well
received by most Singaporeans, the choice for some, or many, is not that
straightforward, given their inclination to want also to vote in an
opposition.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-010#46:2>
But they cannot have it both ways.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-010#47:2>
They should ask themselves some tough questions.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-010#48:2>
What has the opposition candidate standing in their constituency done
to deserve their support?

<ICE-SIN:W2E-010#49:2>
What do they expect him to do in Parliament and can he deliver?

<ICE-SIN:W2E-010#50:2>
Does it make sense to approve of Mr Goh, his policies and his
governing style, and yet have him diminished by denying him the vote he
needs?

<ICE-SIN:W2E-010#51:2>
Every Singaporean whose mind is not made up will have to find his own
answers.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-010#52:2>
His vote counts as it will help determine this country's destiny.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-010#53:2>
He owes it to himself and his family not to gamble with it. </p> </I>

<I>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-010#54:3>
<h> <bold> Give Goh a clear mandate </bold> </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-010#55:3>
<p> SINGAPOREANS go to the polls today, the seventh since Independence, faced
with, essentially, only two key issues: the call by the People's Action Party
( PAP) for a resounding endorsement of Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong's style
of government and his new policies, versus the Singapore Democratic Party (
SDP) line that there must be stronger opposition in Parliament.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-010#56:3>
Both are serious issues.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-010#57:3>
Are they mutually exclusive?

<ICE-SIN:W2E-010#58:3>
Yes, says the PAP.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-010#59:3>
No, says the SDP.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-010#60:3>
The Workers' Party's answer - that the question is irrelevant - is
bereft of sense.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-010#61:3>
Whatever Mr Goh's reason for calling a snap election two years ahead
of schedule - that is his prerogative, as the incumbent Prime Minister - it
has to be fought by the opposition.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-010#62:3>
Calling it an <quote> unnecessary </quote> election is no campaign line.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-010#63:3>
The SDP's line at least has the merit of being clever: With the PAP
returned to power, having secured 41 out of 81 seats on Nomination Day, Mr
Goh already has the mandate he wants; so vote in more opposition members,
says SDP leader Chiam See Tong. </p>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-010#64:3>

<p> Mr Chiam's line would have been seductive to more voters if not for the
PAP's effective campaign strategy, the most focused in recent elections.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-010#65:3>
Mr Goh surprised many when he said, early in the campaign: <X>
<quote> I am the issue. </quote> </X>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-010#66:3>
Voters have heard again and again in the last nine days that the
issue is his style of governing.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-010#67:3>
The word <mention> style </mention> does not do justice to what Mr Goh stands
for.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-010#68:3>
What he is presenting to Singaporeans is a whole new political
culture for the country.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-010#69:3>
It encompasses a number of important elements: a genuine search for
consensus; accommodation of alternative views, so long as they are reasonable
and not extremist; harvesting the ideas of as many people as possible, right
down to the grassroots level; and keeping in close touch with the common man
to hear his views.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-010#70:3>
So in this context, <mention> style </mention> is not the opposite of
<mention> substance </mention>.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-010#71:3>
It is not abstract either because it affects the lives of
Singaporeans in a concrete and practical way - for instance, in deciding the
kind of parks they want in their neighbourhoods.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-010#72:3>
What Mr Goh proposes is a grassroots democracy, no less - a big
compliment to the political maturity of the Singapore population. </p>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-010#73:3>

<p> What are the alternatives?

<ICE-SIN:W2E-010#74:3>
As far as Mr Goh is concerned, a <quote> weak signal </quote> from
the electorate must mean that the majority of Singaporeans are not exactly
enamoured of his new political culture.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-010#75:3>
Will it also mean that the old style is still favoured - the one
which says: I have your mandate, so I will govern the way I think best?

<ICE-SIN:W2E-010#76:3>
It will be difficult to say.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-010#77:3>
To be sure, this latter approach has it merits - and its supporters.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-010#78:3>
But Singaporeans, as a people, must choose which approach they prefer
and be unambiguous about it.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-010#79:3>
At stake is their future and their children's future - and the way
that future will be shaped. </p>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-010#80:3>

<p> As for Mr Chiam, he would like Singaporeans to believe that they can have
their cake and eat it too - by giving a mandate to the Prime Minister and
voting in more opposition members.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-010#81:3>
But Mr Goh, who has proven to be a far more canny politician than
many have given him credit for, has scotched this idea and forced the
fence-sitters to choose.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-010#82:3>
Their choice would have been more difficult if the opposition had
fielded a better slate of candidates.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-010#83:3>
Sadly, the crop this time is only marginally better than in previous
elections.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-010#84:3>
Most are the same old tired faces.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-010#85:3>
This is sad because aside from questions of style and culture,
Singapore's political system must have room for more opposition -
<it> good </it> opposition. <X>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-010#X86:3>
So voters face a dilemma only if they are presented with worthy
opposition candidates.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-010#X87:3>
As this is hardly the case in the majority of contested wards, and
the PAP has the better candidates in any case, the choice is a clear one.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-010#X88:3>
Mr Goh deserves a decisive mandate - 65 per cent at least - and
Singaporeans should give him one today.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-010#X89:3>
If they do, they will be in good hands well into the next century.
</p> </X> </I>
