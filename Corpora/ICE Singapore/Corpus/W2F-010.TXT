<ICE-SIN:W2F-010#1:1>
Kang was standing by the open window of his bed-room when Teck Wu
knocked at the door.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-010#2:1>
He was so preoccupied with his thoughts as he gazed at the hibiscus
plants outside that he did not hear the knock.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-010#3:1>
His mind was in a state of gloom and he was unaware that the air
outside was alive with activity.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-010#4:1>
The morning was bright and cheerful and the leaves of the big mango
tree outside were rustling in the breeze.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-010#5:1>
Little flocks of birds, chirping gleefully, were playing 'follow the
leader' as they flew high above the roofs of the nearby houses.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-010#6:1>
But Kang was totally oblivious of their morning salutations although
he was very fond of birds, especially the singing ones.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-010#7:1>
As he stood and stared vacantly out of the window, some of the rays of
the morning sun, that were just peering over the roofs of the neighbouring
houses and trees and tinting the sky with its silvery and golden hues, gently
caressed him.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-010#8:1>
The rain had stopped at dawn and the grass and leaves of the plants in
the garden were still wet.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-010#9:1>
The tips of most of the leaves were decorated with beads of water
hanging precariously and threatening to drop on to the ground with the
slightest agitation.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-010#10:1>
And every once in a while, showers of water fell to the ground from
the leaves of the mango tree as they rustled excitedly with each gust of
wind.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-010#11:1>
In Kang's room, there was a smell of refreshing wetness as wafts of
the cool after-rain, morning breeze raced through the window every now and
then.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-010#12:1>
Kang had woken up earlier than usual that morning after a restless
night.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-010#13:1>
It was still far from dawn and the rain was no longer heavy.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-010#14:1>
But it was not the rain which had woken him up for he could usually
sleep through even a thunderstorm and it had always been Amy who had to get
out of bed to shut the windows whenever it rained in the middle of the night.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-010#15:1>
All that Kang could remember was that the rain had started to fall
soon after he went to bed at midnight and had continued to fall throughout
the night.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-010#16:1>
Although he was innately obsessive about time and punctuality, he
forgot to see the clock when he awoke that morning - something which he had
never failed to do every morning.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-010#17:1>
All he remembered was that the sky was still dark and the rain had
lightened to a drizzle.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-010#18:1>
He tried to fall asleep again but could not.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-010#19:1>
After tossing and turning in bed for some time, he decided that it
was futile to try and sleep again.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-010#20:1>
But, because of the rain he could not go out for his usual early
morning walk around the estate.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-010#21:1>
So, he went out of the bedroom instead, and paced up and down the
living room.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-010#22:1>
There was nothing left to do for he had completed packing his things
the night before.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-010#23:1>
He must have walked up and down for at least a hundred times while
waiting for the rain to stop completely when his patience was taxed to its
limit.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-010#24:1>
Feeling restless and agitated now, he decided to take an unusually
early bath - at five in the morning.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-010#25:1>
He had always taken his bath at seven when the sun and the
temperature of the air had risen appreciably so that he would not catch a
chill.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-010#26:1>
After his bath, he changed into a clean, neatly ironed shirt and
pants.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-010#27:1>
Hardly a crease could be seen in both his shirt and pants - which
were the only clothes of his still hanging in the cupboard.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-010#28:1>
Kang had always been very fastidious about his clothes and would
trust nobody - not even Amy - but himself to iron them.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-010#29:1>
Even the slightest crease would upset him.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-010#30:1>
He was very meticulous and systematic in his ironing so that his
clothes would look immaculately smart.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-010#31:1>
Even the removal of his clothes from the hanger in the cupboard was
mindfully done so that they would not be prematurely crumpled.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-010#32:1>
And even donning his clothes was attentively carried out.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-010#33:1>
It was still drizzling when Kang finished his bath.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-010#34:1>
Still feeling restless, he decided to have his breakfast - which was
also unusually early.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-010#35:1>
Although he was living with Teck Wu and his family at that time, Kang
had never joined them for breakfast - not even once.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-010#36:1>
Unlike Kang, Teck Wu and his wife, Cynthia, disliked rising early in
the morning.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-010#37:1>
They preferred to sleep until it was absolutely necessary to wake up
and then gobble a hurried breakfast before rushing off to work.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-010#38:1>
And their children too had developed this habit.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-010#39:1>
The day after moving in to stay with Teck Wu, his eldest son, Kang
noticed that the family was always in a rush in the morning.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-010#40:1>
One after another the bathroom doors would go banging away followed
by a flurry of activity at the breakfast table.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-010#41:1>
Meaning well, he asked Teck Wu one day, " Why don't all of you wake
up a little early so that you don't have to rush so much?" It was a good
thing, he thought to himself, but did not voice it, that Cynthia was working
for Teck Wu or else they would need to own two cars.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-010#42:1>
Teck Wu threw a quick glance at his wife and then said, " No rush,
Pa.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-010#43:1>
We are quite used to it."

<ICE-SIN:W2F-010#44:1>
But Cynthia, as Kang later found out from his son, did not take too
kindly to Kang's comments.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-010#45:1>
" Why can't he mind his own business," she asked Teck Wu later on
that night.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-010#46:1>
" It's time he realises that he is only a guest in our house and so
he should keep his view to himself.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-010#47:1>
Nobody asked him for his views."

<ICE-SIN:W2F-010#48:1>
Kang, through years of habit, preferred to rise half an hour or so
before dawn so that he could go for a short brisk walk before the sun peeped
over the horizon.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-010#49:1>
And when he returned home, sweaty after the walk, he would have a
bath before settling down to a good, early and unhurried breakfast.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-010#50:1>
And he applied that habit to his other meals as well.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-010#51:1>
Kang and Amy hated gluttony and a hurried meal.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-010#52:1>
Unless they were ill, they had never broken this morning routine -
which by now had become an obsessive ritual for him.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-010#53:1>
But that morning, Kang was unusually slow in eating his breakfast -
not because he was having it unusually early but because his mind was
wandering and he forgot to swallow whatever his molars had ground to a pulp.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-010#54:1>
By the time he finished his breakfast, it was already dawn.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-010#55:1>
The entire household was still sleeping, and the maid, who usually
woke up before dawn, had overslept.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-010#56:1>
Slowly he washed his cup, dried it and kept it in its usual place in
the cupboard.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-010#57:1>
Then he went back to his bedroom and stood in semi-darkness by the
window as the sky outside was just beginning to brighten.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-010#58:1>
As he stood erect with his hands together behind his back, a mixture
of thoughts raced through his mind.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-010#59:1>
His eyes looked vacant and his face was tinged with an aura of
sadness.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-010#60:1>
His mind was so preoccupied with memories of the past that he did not
even feel the increasing warmth in his body as a broad band of sunlight fell
obliquely past the neighbour's house and the mango tree to enter his window
and imbue him with its invigorating rays.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-010#61:1>
Nor did he hear the creak which the bedroom door made when Teck Wu
opened it and glanced in after receiving no response to his knock.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-010#62:1>
Thinking that his father was in a state of stupor, Teck Wu asked
softly, " Are you okay, Pa?"

<ICE-SIN:W2F-010#63:1>
Kang did not seem to hear for he did not respond.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-010#64:1>
" Pa?" Teck Wu asked again, this time louder, as he walked towards
the old man and touched his shoulders.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-010#65:1>
" You okay?"

<ICE-SIN:W2F-010#66:1>
It was Teck Wu's tap that jolted Kang out of his mental distractions.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-010#67:1>
In spite of that, it still took him a few seconds to realise that
someone had touched him and was speaking to him before he responded.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-010#68:1>
Slowly he turned his head to see who it was.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-010#69:1>
At first, he gazed emptily at Teck Wu, as if he did not recognise his
son.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-010#70:1>
But after a few seconds, his whole body jerked as though he was
emerging from a trance.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-010#71:1>
" Huh?" he muttered.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-010#72:1>
But his mind had not registered what Teck Wu had said.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-010#73:1>
" Are you okay, Pa?"

<ICE-SIN:W2F-010#74:1>
Teck Wu asked again with great concern.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-010#75:1>
It took him another few seconds before he comprehended Teck Wu's
question.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-010#76:1>
But he continued looking at his son with a blank stare for a while
before he replied unconvincingly, " Oh, ya.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-010#77:1>
I'm okay."

<ICE-SIN:W2F-010#78:1>
After a brief silence, Teck Wu, who had, hitherto, been the most
polite and filial of Kang's three sons, offered, " I'm going to office now,
Pa.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-010#79:1>
Can I give you a lift?"

<ICE-SIN:W2F-010#80:1>
By now, Kang seemed to have regained all his senses.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-010#81:1>
He turned down Teck Wu's offer and answered abruptly, " I'll take a
taxi."

<ICE-SIN:W2F-010#82:1>
Kang and his wife, Amy, had always believed that they should not be
dependent on their children for anything - anything at all.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-010#83:1>
Bringing up their children, they believed, was their moral
responsibility since they had brought them out into the world.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-010#84:1>
They had always told their friends that it would be foolhardy to
think that children were dependable and to do so was to bring bitter
disappointment upon themselves.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-010#85:1>
" Are you sure you won't need me to help you with your things?" Teck
Wu asked his father.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-010#86:1>
" No.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-010#87:1>
I'm okay," Kang replied confidently with a nod of his head.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-010#88:1>
He had always been an independent person.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-010#89:1>
So there was no reason for him to rely on the charity of his son now,
he thought to himself.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-010#90:1>
Teck Wu was now lost for words.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-010#91:1>
Kang turned round to look out of the window again.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-010#92:1>
After a short, uneasy silence, Teck Wu apologised, " Pa, I'm sorry
for all this ..."

<ICE-SIN:W2F-010#93:1>
Kang interrupted softly, " You better go.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-010#94:1>
Cynthia will be waiting for you."

<ICE-SIN:W2F-010#95:1>
Teck Wu did not know what to say.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-010#96:1>
He nodded his head but Kang did not turn to look.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-010#97:1>
After a while, Teck Wu took a deep breath as if trying to summon all
his strength and said, " Pa ..."

<ICE-SIN:W2F-010#98:1>
" Bye," Kang interrupted again and waved his son off.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-010#99:1>
Kang always displayed such abruptness and lack of warmth whenever he
was upset.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-010#100:1>
" Bye, Pa," said Teck Wu, with his head bent down, as he left the
bedroom and shut the door behind him.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-010#101:1>
It was Monday, a week before Christmas.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-010#102:1>
It was not a day that Kang was looking forward to.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-010#103:1>
He was moving out of the house.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-010#104:1>
It was better for him to leave before Cynthia threw her annual
Christmas party, he decided.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-010#105:1>
Teck Wu and Cynthia had moved up the social ladder and Kang felt
that he could not fit into the affluent society in which they were moving.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-010#106:1>
The events of the last Christmas were still very vivid in his mind.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-010#107:1>
He recalled how lively the party must have been with the adults
eating and drinking in the garden and the children playing their party games
in the living room.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-010#108:1>
In the late afternoon, before the party began, Teck Wu had a little
talk with his father who was all neatly dressed up and sitting comfortably on
the sofa in the living room, reading the daily newspaper - and waiting for
the party to start.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-010#109:1>
" Pa," Teck Wu said, rather nervously.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-010#110:1>
" About tonight's party."

<ICE-SIN:W2F-010#111:1>
" Yes?" replied Kang, putting down the newspaper.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-010#112:1>
" I will push the TV into your room so that you can watch whatever
programme you may like."

<ICE-SIN:W2F-010#113:1>
Push the TV?

<ICE-SIN:W2F-010#114:1>
Watch the programmes?

<ICE-SIN:W2F-010#115:1>
Kang asked himself.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-010#116:1>
He was puzzled.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-010#117:1>
What did Teck Wu mean?

<ICE-SIN:W2F-010#118:1>
He was too surprised to say a word.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-010#119:1>
Then Teck Wu added, " You know what I mean? <X>

<ICE-SIN:W2F-010#X120:1>
I don't think you will feel comfortable with my friends - and
Cynthia's friends, too."

<ICE-SIN:W2F-010#X121:1>
Kang was a very astute man.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-010#X122:1>
" You mean to say that you are ashamed of your father?"

<ICE-SIN:W2F-010#X123:1>
" No, Pa," Teck Wu hastily answered.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-010#X124:1>
" What I mean is that I'm afraid you will not be able to mix with
them. </X> </I>
