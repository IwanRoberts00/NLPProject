<h> THE FAMILY ETHNOGRAPHY </h>

<ICE-SIN:W1A-010#2:1>
<h> Introduction </h>

<ICE-SIN:W1A-010#3:1>
Lee Pit Khiam, my father's father, was born in the Chinese province of
Fukien in 1913.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-010#4:1>
He was match-made with my father's mother, Lim Bee Hong, who was then
17, in 1933.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-010#5:1>
Lee Pit Khiam and Lim Bee Hong migrated first to Burma and then to
Singapore in 1939 where my father, Lee Chiow Beng, was born in 1941.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-010#6:1>
Lee Pit Khiam was the symbol of authority in the family and my father
and his siblings were strictly disciplined as youths.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-010#7:1>
What struck me was the great deal of respect the children had for
their father, enduring his scolding and caning in silence.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-010#8:1>
Unlike Lim Hue-Liang in the House of Lim who openly rebelled against
his father's discipline, my father and his two older brothers not only
accepted their father's rebuke but even sacrificed chances for further
studies in the University then to support the family when Lee Pit Khiam
suffered from gastric cancer in later life.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-010#9:1>
In this way, their younger siblings were given the chance for higher
education.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-010#10:1>
Such a sacrifice spoke to me about the optimistic side of discipline.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-010#11:1>
Virtues like filial piety and 'family before self' were internalised
in the children.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-010#12:1>
The bonds that hold brothers and sisters in the family are strong to
this day.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-010#13:1>
My mother's mother's mother, Tan Gek Khim, was born in Swatow in
1900.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-010#14:1>
She came to Singapore with her parents as living conditions in China
worsened.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-010#15:1>
She was match-made with a Straits-born widower, Tay Soo Chiang, who
was many years her senior.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-010#16:1>
The assimilation of Peranakan culture into Tan Gek Khim's lifestyle
is interesting considering her very Chinese background.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-010#17:1>
Besides having to learn to cook Peranakan dishes and wear a sarong
kebaya, she also had to learn to speak the Malay language.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-010#18:1>
However, in spite of all these changes, Chinese customs and
traditions were still kept intact in the family.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-010#19:1>
Tan Gek Khim explained that though her husband had been brought up in
Malacca, his sense of belonging to the Chinese remained strong.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-010#20:1>
Being well-educated, Tay Soo Chiang held a considerably high post
under the British government.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-010#21:1>
He was able to foresee the importance of education at that time for
his four daughters, one of whom was my mother's mother, Tay Leong Chye, who
was born in 1923.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-010#22:1>
Tay Leong Chye and her sisters were educated at Geylang Methodist
Girls' School.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-010#23:1>
I consider this unusual since girls at that time were hardly given
the opportunity to study as the boys were.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-010#24:1>
I attribute this to the comfortable financial position of the family
then as well as the foresight of Tay Soo Chiang.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-010#25:1>
Hence economic factors and Tay Soo Chiang's educational attainment
contributed to the education of all his daughters.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-010#26:1>
Tay Leong Chye met Lim Bock Guan, also a Peranakan, and were married
in 1943.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-010#27:1>
My mother, Lim Poh Choo, was born in 1947.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-010#28:1>
My parents met and were married in 1971.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-010#29:1>
The following year, I was presented to this world.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-010#30:1>
<h> The Family Today </h>

<ICE-SIN:W1A-010#31:1>
Like most families in Singapore, mine belongs to the nuclear
category, consisting of my parents, my younger sister and myself.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-010#32:1>
The nuclear family in Singapore is one of the consequences of housing
policies laid down by the HDB ( Housing and Development Board) in 1960.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-010#33:1>
According to recent statistics about 87% of Singapore's population
live in HDB flats.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-010#34:1>
The basically small size of the flats meant that most extended
families had to be broken up.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-010#35:1>
The traditional Chinese family consisting of three to four
generations living under the same roof was no longer plausible.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-010#36:1>
The small size of my family is a result of the 2-child policy
implemented by the government in the 1970s.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-010#37:1>
Most of my peers have only one other sibling in their families.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-010#38:1>
This was because " From the start the Singapore government is
determined to limit population growth so that the hard-won fruits of economic
progress may not be depleted by a population explosion" ( Wong:218).

<ICE-SIN:W1A-010#39:1>
At the same time people realised that fewer children meant that they
were better able to provide the best for each child.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-010#40:1>
" Nowadays, couples want children for reasons which are mainly
connected with personal fulfilment or for emotional satisfaction, as distinct
from the 'traditional' reasons such as for the continuity of the family name
or for support in old age" ( Wong:217).

<ICE-SIN:W1A-010#41:1>
I was initially surprised, from what I read here, that Chinese were
no longer eager to have sons to perpetuate the family name.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-010#42:1>
On further checking on the 1973 FPPB ( Family Planning and
Productivity Board) Survey, I realised that by and large, the general
population of that time still preferred boys despite the FPPB slogan of 'Girl
or Boy, two is enough'.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-010#43:1>
However, 18 years after that survey was conducted, most of my friends
tell me that they really have no preference over the sex of their children.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-010#44:1>
Obviously, living in comfort and the enjoyment of a fulfilling family
life are the main concerns of most couples now.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-010#45:1>
Indeed, times have changed. <h> Decision-making and the Elderly </h>

<ICE-SIN:W1A-010#46:1>
The issue of decision-making cannot be alienated from economic
factors.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-010#47:1>
Financial contribution gives an individual a say in the running of
the family.


<ICE-SIN:W1A-010#48:1>
In my family it is not my father's mother or my mother's mother, but
the youngest members having earning abilities who have major dictatorship on
how the family is run.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-010#49:1>
For example, my grandmothers had little say over where my family was
going to stay or the type of house we would live in.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-010#50:1>
This phenomena is well perceived in The House of Lim. <X> <quote>

<ICE-SIN:W1A-010#X51:1>
Nowadays jobs outside the village give young men bargaining power
with their parents ( Wolf:65). </quote> </X>

<ICE-SIN:W1A-010#52:1>
A recent report in the Straits Times, " Dead Men Shed No Tears" ( The
Straits Times, November 10) spoke of the increasing number of suicide
attempts by the elderly who feel abandoned by their children.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-010#53:1>
I believe the average Singaporean's idea of filial piety has been
reduced to a mere financial support.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-010#54:1>
Much of the traditional respect due to the elderly has been left
behind somewhere on our road to affluence.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-010#55:1>
It is indeed ironic that a country so close to 'excellence' should be
so lacking in its respect for the people who gave them life itself.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-010#56:1>
My grandmothers are well-cared for, but many of my peers agree with
me that their advice and opinions are seldom appreciated.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-010#57:1>
<h> Women in the Family </h>

<ICE-SIN:W1A-010#58:1>
In China where the one-child policy is being practised, thousands of
female babies are killed each year because parents hope to have a son to
continue the family line.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-010#59:1>
Although sons were considered important to carry on the family name,
my mother was treated just as well as her brother.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-010#60:1>
I am also fortunate to live in a family where girls are treasured as
much as boys.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-010#61:1>
Women of today have a much greater say in affairs of the household.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-010#62:1>
Industrialisation gave good reason for women to find jobs outside
their homes to supplement the family income.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-010#63:1>
This financial independence allows them a say in running the home as
well as enjoying a more egalitarian relationship with their husbands.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-010#64:1>
Compulsory education has also helped the woman in her struggle for
equal rights.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-010#65:1>
" The most important reason women with young children take up
employment is economic, whilst the most important factor preventing them from
seeking employment is the burden of childcare" ( Wong:57).

<ICE-SIN:W1A-010#66:1>
The modern woman in today's society finds herself constantly
straddling between her children and her career.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-010#67:1>
My mother and her mother both stopped working for the first few years
after childbirth to look after the children.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-010#68:1>
Conservative as I may sound, I still believe that a married woman's
first and foremost priority is still her children and then her career.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-010#69:1>
<h> Expectations of Marriage </h>

<ICE-SIN:W1A-010#70:1>
My mother's mother's mother's marriage was match-made.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-010#71:1>
Since she hardly even met the guy before marriage, all she hoped for
was that he was well-off financially and kind towards her.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-010#72:1>
Compared to the past, today's expectations of marriage partners seem
much more complicated.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-010#73:1>
Factors like race, religion, educational qualifications, financial
disposition and physical appearance come into play in the choice of a spouse
today.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-010#74:1>
My father has told me that he " would rather die" than see me
marrying a Malay or an Indian.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-010#75:1>
I have realised that though Singapore's religious harmony appears
commendable on the surface, prejudice against races other than our own still
remain.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-010#76:1>
Many conflicts have arisen since my sister's and my conversion to
Christianity.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-010#77:1>
Differences in viewpoints and attitudes due to our different
religious beliefs ( my father's an atheist) have often resulted in quarrels
and disharmony.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-010#78:1>
I am hence more determined than before to marry a Christian man for
my sake as well as for my children's sake.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-010#79:1>
I have always found it strange that in the face of differing religion
and educational attainments ( my father's a senior middle 3 leaver while my
mother's a graduate), my parents got together.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-010#80:1>
Obviously, these were not crucial factors to my parents then.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-010#81:1>
Recent years have seen many graduate women left on the shelf.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-010#82:1>
On the one hand, they are not willing to settle for guys who were
perhaps " less qualified" than they while on the other, neither were men
willing to shatter their male egos by marrying someone seemingly more capable
than them.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-010#83:1>
Clearly, modernisation of society has created a set of social
pressures by which we have been taught to conform to, even in the choice of a
life-long partner.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-010#84:1>
<h> Religion and the Family </h>

<ICE-SIN:W1A-010#85:1>
My father's family members are predominantly Buddhists.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-010#86:1>
Though my father himself is not a practising Buddhist in the sense
that he does not pray to any gods, he does do things like burn joss-sticks
on certain occasions to please his devout mother.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-010#87:1>
Whether it be parental influence or anything else, the whole family
seems quite happy settling with Buddhism as a religion.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-010#88:1>
On the other hand, my mother's family members are all either
Christians or Catholics.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-010#89:1>
My mother is the only daughter-in-law in my father's family who is
English-educated as well as Christian.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-010#90:1>
It is evident that differences in religion as well as that of the
language of communication can sow seeds of division within the family.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-010#91:1>
But why Buddhism or Christianity?

<ICE-SIN:W1A-010#92:1>
I believe that my father is an atheist by nature and is only a
so-called Buddhist for the sake of his mother.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-010#93:1>
Maybe that is too harsh a judgment.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-010#94:1>
After all, Buddhism was a religion embraced particularly by the
Chinese in China as it speaks of the release from poverty in the process of
doing good to attain Nirvana.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-010#95:1>
As a result, it would be fair to conclude that Buddhism can be
associated with the Chinese-educated.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-010#96:1>
My mother's side of the family were all educated in English Mission
schools.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-010#97:1>
I hence deduce that the English-educated are more receptive and open
to Christianity.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-010#98:1>
In a recent religious survey, it was shown that the majority of
Christians in Singapore were the English-educated and the financially better
off individuals.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-010#99:1>
As such, many of us have been led into thinking that Christianity is
a religion only for the " westernised" people in our society.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-010#100:1>
I believe Christianity is not bound by educational standards or
wealth.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-010#101:1>
China has one of the highest rates of conversion and many of these
converts are neither well-educated nor rich.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-010#102:1>
Probably it is due to a lack of translation of the Christian message
into Mandarin or the other dialects that have hindered the Chinese-educated
from embracing the religion here.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-010#103:1>
As the children of parents of different religions, my sister and I
were left with the decision of " which side to follow".

<ICE-SIN:W1A-010#104:1>
The reasons for our conversion to Christianity were hardly concrete
ones except probably that we were also educated in an English Mission school
and we were, generally, closer to my mother's side of the family.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-010#105:1>
However I believe that I would still be a Christian today even if
these factors were absent.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-010#106:1>
I feel that the real reason for my conversion goes beyond a simple
rationale for believing in God.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-010#107:1>
I feel that conversion in itself is a supernatural occurrence and
not a philosophical reasoning.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-010#108:1>
<h> Conclusion </h>

<ICE-SIN:W1A-010#109:1>
My sister and I are generally much closer to my mother's side of the
family. <X>

<ICE-SIN:W1A-010#X110:1>
This could be because we had been looked after by my mother's
mother from young.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-010#X111:1>
We also share a common religion and a familiar language of
communication.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-010#X112:1>
Sometimes I feel a sense of loss when I sense barriers between
myself and my father's side of the family.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-010#X113:1>
In fact I hardly knew the names of any of my cousins, father's
brothers or sisters before I had to come up with the genealogy.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-010#X114:1>
It is so easy to just greet them respectfully during festive
occasions when beneath all this superficiality lie seemingly irreconcilable
differences.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-010#X115:1>
I am indeed grateful to my parents and my sister for all the
support they have given me.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-010#X116:1>
Truly, I can proudly say that my family is not only a refuge from
life's storms but also one from which I can experience the joy of unfailing
family bonds. </X> </I>
