<I>

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-070#1:1:A>
So what do you think of the A E presentation we had yesterday

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-070#2:1:B>
Uhm it was okay

<ICE-SIN:S1A-070#3:1:B>
We we got to know about their projects uhm the outcome why they
choose the projects the type of methodology they use the philosophical
underpinnings etcetera

<ICE-SIN:S1A-070#4:1:B>
So how then

<ICE-SIN:S1A-070#5:1:B>
How you gonna present yours

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-070#6:1:A>
I haven't actually think about it but from what yesterday the
impression is that uh there's not much of questions being posed to the
presenters lah and I personally hope that the presenters and the teacher
might not take it might not take questions uhm too personally

<ICE-SIN:S1A-070#7:1:A>
I mean not as an attack uh personal attack or something like that

<ICE-SIN:S1A-070#8:1:A>
It's just a purely academic enquiry something like that

<ICE-SIN:S1A-070#9:1:A>
So it will be more interesting in that sense lah because actually
there's a lot of uh things that I wanted to ask lah but judging from the face
of the presenter I dare not lah because they might think otherwise you see

<ICE-SIN:S1A-070#10:1:A>
So that is the thing you know

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-070#11:1:B>
And I guess the other problem is that it deals with Physical
Geography and it's not our line so call so we may not be able to to to
discuss the issue in greater depth and in detail and also we may not know
that issues in

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-070#12:1:A>
You didn't take Physical Geog

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-070#13:1:B>
I do I do but really another way in in to think it is that uhm
I don't want to ask too many questions and because you not not only

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-070#14:1:A>
Bad guy

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-070#15:1:B>
Not the bad guy but simply you you know they standing down
there they'll be very very

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-070#16:1:A>
Nervous

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-070#17:1:B>
Nervous

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-070#18:1:A>
And I mean

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-070#19:1:B>
And they don't want to be asked

<ICE-SIN:S1A-070#20:1:B>
Yes and not only that you know it no matter you are the first batch
or the later batch if you are down there you'll be very nervous and you hope
that nobody gonna ask you questions because there's always this fear whereby
what happen if I cannot answer

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-070#21:1:A>
Oh

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-070#22:1:B>
Right

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-070#23:1:A>
So be it

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-070#24:1:B>
I know so be it but you know you'll you'll definitely feel
that you failed you know like you are not that good but especially when you
you notice that there are people who would are able to do pretty well and you
are comparing yourself with him so you <unclear> word </unclear>

<ICE-SIN:S1A-070#25:1:B>
Oh I might have done that bad so I won't get that much good grades
you know something

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-070#26:1:A>
Sometime their presentation is

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-070#27:1:B>
Ya I admit

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-070#28:1:A>
It's just a

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-070#29:1:B>
Ya ya

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-070#30:1:A>
Part of the grading

<ICE-SIN:S1A-070#31:1:A>
It's not the whole of the grading you see so you shouldn't be bog
down to anxiety or you know being not able to answer the questions but must
take it in the positive light lah positive spirit that's the whole thing

<ICE-SIN:S1A-070#32:1:A>
Then there's a lively discussion nah not a very quiet session just
a presenter doing his job or something

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-070#33:1:B>
But I guess it I guess the topic dealt with is Physical so no
people really bother or they don't know they're not in the line to to ask
questions so I guess when it comes to the later portion

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-070#34:1:A>
Ya maybe the Human

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-070#35:1:B>
The Human side whereby there'll be more people asking more
question because you are more familiar with the issues

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-070#36:1:A>
Ya

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-070#37:1:B>
Ya definitely

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-070#38:1:A>
So your your topic falls under what

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-070#39:1:B>
Okay mine is Behavioural meaning that I'm looking at the
locational decisions of firms which are found near Changi Airport so in that
sense I'm asking about why they decide to locate at Changi

<ICE-SIN:S1A-070#40:1:B>
Has the factors in Changi attract them meaning uhm do the airport
does the airport uh create a conducive environment for them to to to acquire
their products overseas or to sell their products in overseas market

<ICE-SIN:S1A-070#41:1:B>
Uhm at the same time I'm looking at the spatial patterns uhm is
there any special areas whereby these firms will locate

<ICE-SIN:S1A-070#42:1:B>
Are they being dictated by their own choices or by government
something like that

<ICE-SIN:S1A-070#43:1:B>
Although my main concern is actually on the uhm growth pole I mean
the airport has a growth centre in terms of natural forces meaning naturally
you will develop because the airport is there and you attract the firms to
that location

<ICE-SIN:S1A-070#44:1:B>
But I know definitely the government will play a very important
role so I had to look into the qualitative issue rather than the quantitative
issues

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-070#45:1:A>
What do they think which are

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-070#46:1:B>
Meaning that I got to conduct surveys interviews with the stat
boards

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-070#47:1:A>
And have you done so

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-070#48:1:B>
Yes and it's not easy because they're not willing to talk that
much

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-070#49:1:A>
Is a is a not

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-070#50:1:B>
Is a ya and they are not willing to disclose too many
informations so that could be

<ICE-SIN:S1A-070#51:1:B>
Another problem which I face is not many of my surveyed form are
returned so my sampling size are pretty small actually

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-070#52:1:A>
Sampling size interview

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-070#53:1:B>
Ya

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-070#54:1:A>
So are you going to do anything about it because normally when
you select the sample size right you'll take into account of
representativeness whether the size if representative or where the issue that
you're dealing with

<ICE-SIN:S1A-070#55:1:A>
So when you come across this problem of survey forms not returned
there will definitely in a one way or another affect the representativeness

<ICE-SIN:S1A-070#56:1:A>
So what are you gonna to do with it

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-070#57:1:B>
Okay I I agree in that area but thank goodness on my case is
that the number of replied are quite equal meaning that I have the number of
form which I wanted so I'm quite happy with it in that sense but I would
prefer more you see

<ICE-SIN:S1A-070#58:1:B>
Usually like for example under one category only have one or two
replied form instead of four or five ya so when it's one or two it would
represent the whole you see so that is what I'm worried but as long as I'm
able to get something is better than nothing

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-070#59:1:A>
If when you do surveys is normally the case lah unless you do
informal surveys over the telephone or doing a tape recording like this then
you won't have the problem of surveys not coming back nah

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-070#60:1:B>
The only problem is that you must get to allow you tape the
voices to allow you for such interview

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-070#61:1:A>
Basically a behavioural approach approach uhm mine is
essential texture it's a post-modern challenge and geographical approach

<ICE-SIN:S1A-070#62:1:A>
Uh basically I'll be looking at the heminetical aspect that means
in terms of uh interpreting language

<ICE-SIN:S1A-070#63:1:A>
The text here shall refer to the newspapers lah that of my main
source of information for it

<ICE-SIN:S1A-070#64:1:A>
Uhm I'll be looking at environmental issues as contain in the
newspaper uh time series analysis of four years

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-070#65:1:B>
Why environment is is there any other

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-070#66:1:A>
It's geographical in a sense because the approach is looking
at text the newspapers as text and it's geographical because we are looking
at environment

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-070#67:1:B>
Okay

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-070#68:1:A>
Ya how how the media especially the the Malay newspapers has
been instrumental in in so-called instilling a sense of environmental
awareness amongst the community lah

<ICE-SIN:S1A-070#69:1:A>
So that that is so you can call it a hypothesis so so to say uhm in
terms of environmental awareness among the Malay community

<ICE-SIN:S1A-070#70:1:A>
Why did <unclear> word </unclear> the role of media has been
positive positive or otherwise

<ICE-SIN:S1A-070#71:1:A>
So basically that's it lah and the research thing has been going
rather slow and it's brilliant

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-070#72:1:B>
It's takes quite a lot of time ya

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-070#73:1:A>
Because you're dealing with not one or two newspapers what
you're dealing with four years you know four years and that's three hundred
and sixty-five times four

<ICE-SIN:S1A-070#74:1:A>
Over such a short period of few months and having a lot of other
things to do I wish I could have done more lah in the sense because there are
other areas that is worth looking lah in terms of what let's say production
of production and consumption of environmental meanings because right now uh
what I'm dealing with is under consumption part how the the the readers
specially the Malay community so called decode uh interpret the what is
written in the newspapers lah

<ICE-SIN:S1A-070#75:1:A>
I'm not dealing much on the con production side ya

<ICE-SIN:S1A-070#76:1:A>
Production is a a more intricate thing you got you got to know who
are the writers

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-070#77:1:B>
Why they want

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-070#78:1:A>
Ah their intent intention all this so

<ICE-SIN:S1A-070#79:1:A>
Edmund is dealing with the production side because he's dealing
more towards the the the production of comics

<ICE-SIN:S1A-070#80:1:A>
Uh so but he has a so-called access to the interviews written by
others on the with respect to the authors lah the the comic writers lah

<ICE-SIN:S1A-070#81:1:A>
So maybe he can use that as a as a basis of uhm ya the production
side so I don't have access because nobody has interviewed any of the
journalists and

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-070#82:1:B>
Why don't you try and interview them

<ICE-SIN:S1A-070#83:1:B>
I mean wouldn't that be easily maybe you can

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-070#84:1:A>
Ya I tried I'm I'm going to interview them only after I have
establish my

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-070#85:1:B>
Okay your record

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-070#86:1:A>
Yes my research findings because without the research findings
you go there and you tried to interview you don't have that you know yes

<ICE-SIN:S1A-070#87:1:A>
Because if you have the research findings when you go there it's
like your have the thing back in your mind and when they say something which
is

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-070#88:1:B>
Not correct

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-070#89:1:A>
ah contrary to your research findings it's much easier for you
to so-called you know highlight the thing but on the other hand ya if you
don't have the research findings in place before prior to the interview then
it's quite difficult

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-070#90:1:B>
What else <O> Interruption </O> </I>


<I>

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-070#91:2:A>
I'm quite interested about the P S C lah especially on the
education service but uh my main thrust is to ask them what is because uhm
lately there has been calls for increasing teachers' pay so but the details
has has not been made known to public so maybe I I hope they can ya that's
right

<ICE-SIN:S1A-070#92:2:A>
But I don't think they will tell me everything lah in details but
what I suppose is that they will not exactly touch on the starting pay but
more on the increment yearly increment nah because the Civil Service yearly
in increment is very little can say is very little

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-070#93:2:B>
Well for my case I won't be interested of any of these simply
because I'm already bonded so uhm there's no room for me to look other career
until or unless somebody can bail me out of this trap

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-070#94:2:A>
Ah ha but you have to pay uh

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-070#95:2:B>
Ya you got

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-070#96:2:A>
If you want to break the bond you have to pay

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-070#97:2:B>
Yes I have to pay the whole lump sum

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-070#98:2:A>
I think it's about thirty to forty thousand

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-070#99:2:B>
Or maybe more I don't know

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-070#100:2:A>
Ya

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-070#101:2:B>
I can't I I don't bother actually because I thought that uhm
since they already I mean since I have this scholarship and they already
ensured me a job

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-070#102:2:A>
It's a six year scholarship

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-070#103:2:B>
Yes it's a six six years bond

<ICE-SIN:S1A-070#104:2:B>
Well if you were to continue teaching I mean if you intend to
teach right so we might in the same line because my scholarship is actually
teaching

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-070#105:2:A>
Teaching scholarship lah

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-070#106:2:B>
Yes

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-070#107:2:A>
Do you know the starting starting pay

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-070#108:2:B>
Well I'm not very sure

<ICE-SIN:S1A-070#109:2:B>
I guess it's about two thousand

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-070#110:2:A>
Two thousand odd

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-070#111:2:B>
For guys because of the N S thing lah yes

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-070#112:2:A>
But during the the course at N I E will be about one thousand
three right and I mean ya one thousand three hundred

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-070#113:2:B>
Well about it

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-070#114:2:A>
And I've been looking through the past years in terms of this
uh grant you know I mean teaching grant or teaching bursary whatever they
call it

<ICE-SIN:S1A-070#115:2:A>
It has been static static at three one thousand three hundred you
know whereas the general degree uh student-teachers their teaching bursary
has been

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-070#116:2:B>
Raised

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-070#117:2:A>
Ya has been raised over the years ya but this uh Honours for
for the Honours student the the the teaching bursary has not been disturbed
at all

<ICE-SIN:S1A-070#118:2:A>
So it has been rather static at one thousand three hundred <X>

<ICE-SIN:S1A-070#X119:2:A>
So what what do you think this one thousand three hundred

<ICE-SIN:S1A-070#X120:2:A>
Do you think it's enough

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-070#X121:2:B>
Well actually uhm maybe not now maybe later when the time
comes I guess the problem will be there

<ICE-SIN:S1A-070#X122:2:B>
I really don't because presently you don't need the money so and
you I guess you won't feel the difference but unless during that time when
you start to be involved in the whole programme and you need the money then
you starts to voice out again

<ICE-SIN:S1A-070#X123:2:B>
So normally you just tackle the problem when the problems come
lah

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-070#X124:2:A>
Do you think uh the education service has done uh done their
part in terms of retaining the the talented the best in terms of uh teachers

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-070#X125:2:B>
Well if you were to look at my case most of my lect tutors
in J Cs they have left

<ICE-SIN:S1A-070#X126:2:B>
Ya in fact they are all quite good simply because other places or
rather the private sides are paying them more than what the teaching line are
doing so I guess one of the method is the pay

<ICE-SIN:S1A-070#X127:2:B>
Another one would definitely be the extra things which you will
have to be involve especially E C As uhm maybe setting out some funny
programmes uh schemes uhm camp especially

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-070#X128:2:A>
Camp

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-070#X129:2:B>
Ya some some are involve in like you know English camps in
video camps

<ICE-SIN:S1A-070#X130:2:B>
What have you

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-070#X131:2:A>
So to make the career more ex exciting in a sense lah

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-070#X132:2:B>
Ya

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-070#X133:2:A>
But what what do you think of

<ICE-SIN:S1A-070#X134:2:A>
Okay so far the the

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-070#X135:2:B>
I guess the problem is the burden they have

<ICE-SIN:S1A-070#X136:2:B>
If the principal is able to get uhm some other extra personnels
to dealt with to

<ICE-SIN:S1A-070#X137:2:B>
I mean to to

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-070#X138:2:A>
To deal with the

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-070#X139:2:B>
To to to deal with this

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-070#X140:2:A>
Administrative

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-070#X141:2:B>
nNt only administrative matters but maybe the E C As you
know like you know like maybe for instance to talk about N P C C maybe can
get some of those people who are more involve in N P C C to to to become
guidence or counsellor rather than rather than to get the locals </X> </I>
