<h> <bold> How to be a good Chinese </bold> </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-007#2:1>
<p> IN CALLING for a comprehensive report on the future direction of the
Chinese in Singapore, Member of Parliament Ow Chin Hock recently
suggested how various strands of an ongoing discussion could be put
into a cogent format.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-007#3:1>
Dr Ow, who is MP for Leng Kee, said that Chinese clans community
groups, private companies and Chinese- and English-educated
intellectuals should come together to produce an objective report
covering the culture, language, education and value system of Chinese
Singaporeans.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-007#4:1>
Dr Ow warned, however, that setting up an association to
represent the interests of the Chinese community was premature.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-007#5:1>
Its purpose might be misunderstood and seen as divisive, he said, but
added that the idea could be considered if a grassroots committee
suggested it.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-007#6:1>
The Singapore Chinese Teachers' Union, speaking out in support of Dr
Ow's call has urged the Singapore Federation of Chinese Clan Associations or
the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry to organise a
conference to set up the proposed committee. </p>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-007#7:1>
<p> As these discussions take off, it might be appropriate to suggest a
few basic parameters for them.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-007#8:1>
The first is that there is no doubt that Singapore's Asian culture
needs to be preserved and that includes addressing the cultural issues
confronting the Chinese community.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-007#9:1>
Any report that, calmly and dispassionately, suggests how this may be
done will be a contribution to the country's cultural vitality.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-007#10:1>
However, it is essential to ensure that the legitimate attempt to
chart a culturally Asian future for Singapore does not get hijacked into an
East-West diatribe of the kind that comes naturally to some, both in the West
and in the East.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-007#11:1>
The way to avoid the problem is to avoid adopting two cultural
extremes: treating values as universal ( so that the question of giving them
a geographical setting is meaningless); and treating values as geographically
exclusive, with the added proviso that the values of one part of the world
are all bad and the values of another are all good. </p>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-007#12:1>
<p> Thus, there <it> are </it> such things as Asian values in the sense that they
originated in Asia, have become identified with Asian history or today
play a larger and deeper role in the lives of Asian peoples than of
others.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-007#13:1>
However, these values might be present in a similar or comparable
form in other parts of the world ( though they might not be given the same
cultural weight as they do here).

<ICE-SIN:W2E-007#14:1>
More important, not all Asian values are good and Western values bad.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-007#15:1>
Ignoring this might cause cultural preservation to boomerang; after
all, just as some values have ensured Asia's success, others have
caused a by-no-means negligible list of weaknesses that once resulted in
stagnant societies ripe for a colonial takeover.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-007#16:1>
Feudal ideas and attitudes - whatever their real or presumed
justification - are a prime suspect. </p>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-007#17:1>
<p> The other idea worth keeping in mind is the need not to confuse values
with language.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-007#18:1>
A language helps to convey values associated with a particular
culture, but a language is not a value in itself.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-007#19:1>
Thus, Chinese values are best taught in Chinese ( though they may
also be taught in other languages), but the mere emphasis on Chinese will not
result in better preservation of Chinese values.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-007#20:1>
It is an entire way of life the family, school, place of work and
interaction with friends and strangers - that has to be made compatible with
the values being taught for these values to remain genuine.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-007#21:1>
Also, not only must values be taught, they must be practised as well,
especially so that the young find such practice both viable and fulfilling.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-007#22:1>
In this context, the needs of Singapore's multiracial society
have to be firmly remembered so that, in the correct desire to keep
Chinese culture viable, the domestic realities of Singapore and the external
realities of the region are not transgressed. </p> </I>
<I>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-007#23:2>
<h> <bold> Helping the Chinese poor </bold> </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-007#24:2>
<p> TO say that the idea of a <quote> Chinese Mendaki </quote> was inevitable
is not to suggest that the merits and implications of such a move should not
be thoroughly explored first.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-007#25:2>
As the proposed body would not receive any government funding, it
would thus be essentially different from Mendaki itself.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-007#26:2>
Given that recent self-help efforts among the Malays and Muslims have
been very much in the public eye, and the Indian community has plans to do
something for the Indian underclass, it is natural that some in the Chinese
community would want to explore the idea of making some concerted efforts to
help the poor among them.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-007#27:2>
But beyond recognising this, what the Chinese elite, and this refers
to wealthy Chinese businessmen, politicians and community leaders, must do
is: first establish that there is the same need in the Chinese
community for self-help efforts to be coordinated on a national scale. </p>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-007#28:2>
<p> Several distinctions between the Chinese, the majority group, and the
Malay and Indian minority groups are worth noting.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-007#29:2>
First, there may not actually be a Chinese underclass like that in
the Malay and Indian communities.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-007#30:2>
Poor Chinese there certainly are, but poor Chinese do often pull
themselves out of poverty through education, of themselves or their children,
or by sheer dogged enterprise.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-007#31:2>
Not many lapse into hopelessness and remain poor generation after
generation as other less striving, materialistic and success-oriented peoples
might do.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-007#32:2>
Moreover, the Chinese community as such is already the most
well-off among Singaporeans and it is safe to assume that while there are
poor Chinese, their numbers are not disproportionate, which is the case for
Malays or Indians.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-007#33:2>
Then also, the Chinese who are poor are also probably less poor than
other poor Singaporeans.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-007#34:2>
Second, poor Chinese are already being helped through a host of clan
associations and other mutual aid groups.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-007#35:2>
Would a national organisation merely and needlessly duplicate
or supplant these existing organisations?

<ICE-SIN:W2E-007#36:2>
This also raises the important issue of what role the current
organisations which are looked to for leadership of the Chinese community -
the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the
Federation of Clan Associations - will play if a <quote> Chinese Mendaki
</quote> were to be set up.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-007#37:2>
Should these two organisations - the first often seen as being
preoccupied only with business interests, and the second, whom some in the
community itself think could also assist needy Chinese as much as they are
trying to do in cultural preservation - not take the initiative?

<ICE-SIN:W2E-007#38:2>
The first has the financial clout while the second has knowledge of
the ground.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-007#39:2>
Would a joint effort by the Chinese Chamber and the Federation be the
answer to how best to coordinate and expand the community's aid to poor
Chinese.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-007#40:2>
These and other related issues should be explored by the Chinese
elite as they decide whether a national, government-initiated Chinese
self-help organisation is needed. </p>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-007#41:2>
<p> But posing these questions does not imply that there are no merits in a
special national organisation.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-007#42:2>
A high-profile national Chinese welfare organisation could well
jolt well-off Chinese into being even more generous of time and money than
they now are.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-007#43:2>
Charged with one main task and rising above the level of clans and
other subgroups, it would be more single-minded, efficient and
equitable in its dealings. </p>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-007#44:2>
<p> The proposal has been made.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-007#45:2>
What is needed now is frank, rational and practical consideration of
all relevant issues.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-007#46:2>
But while this takes place, it should also be remembered that the
practice of Singaporeans helping only members of their own community must
necessarily be an interim arrangement along the way to building a truly
national community of compassionate and self-reliant
Singaporeans.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-007#47:2>
Let not the interim arrangement endanger the realisation of the
ultimate dream. </p> </I>
<I>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-007#48:3>
<h> <bold> Retain the critical values </bold> </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-007#49:3>
<p> SINGAPORE needs to retain the core Confucian values that have propelled
it to economic success, but this does mean jeopardising its multicultural
ideal.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-007#50:3>
With this unambiguous statement, made to the Chinese Press Club,
Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong has cleared much of the unease created by recent
events suggesting a resurgence of Chinese chauvinism in Singapore.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-007#51:3>
As he sees it, the problem is not whether Chinese Singaporeans
will lose their cultural identity and values but whether the country can
survive without these core values of thrift, hard work and group cohesion.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-007#52:3>
The rise of the East Asian economies of Japan, South Korea, Taiwan,
Hong Kong and Singapore has demonstrated that Confucian dynamism -
those values in Confucianism that do not retard innovation - has underpinned
their remarkable success. </p>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-007#53:3>
<p> There are several important messages in the Prime Minister's
clarification.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-007#54:3>
The first is that the minorities should have no fear that Singapore
is turning its back on the founding ideal of multiculturalism.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-007#55:3>
Chinese language and culture are not being promoted to overwhelm the
other languages and cultures in the Singapore matrix.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-007#56:3>
The second message is an appeal to the English-educated Chinese not
to discard the values of their forebears for the Western values of
individualism to which their English-medium education and experiences
have attuned them.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-007#57:3>
That the English-educated Chinese now form the majority of
Singaporeans is the result of history and economics and an integral
part of the country's material success.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-007#58:3>
That success could be threatened as more and more Chinese
Singaporeans lose touch with their cultural traditions and values.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-007#59:3>
The obvious solution is to reinforce those critical values in
the present and coming generations of young Chinese Singaporeans who will
continue to be educated primarily in English. </p>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-007#60:3>
<p> Two approaches are needed.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-007#61:3>
The first is to lure them back to the study of the mother tongue
through sound pedagogy and precept, not administrative coercion.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-007#62:3>
The next is to reach out to the adult English-educated Singaporeans
to convince them that an understanding of Chinese culture widens their
horizons and deepens their perspective in a way that brings tangible
advantages.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-007#63:3>
This is both the more urgent and difficult task.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-007#64:3>
The response of the English-educated to the recent Chinese
Chamber of Commerce and Industry's series of cultural talks is telling.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-007#65:3>
Recent events have confirmed what every thinking Singaporean
has suspected for the past decade - that a divide opening up in Singapore
society is not between the haves and the have-nots but between the
Chinese-educated and the rest.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-007#66:3>
This gulf has to be bridged now.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-007#67:3>
This can be done only by a meeting of the two sides of the cultural
divide: the Chinese-educated must be magnanimous enough to put aside their
feelings of resentment and alienation, justifiable though they may be,
to approach their English-educated compatriots.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-007#68:3>
The English-educated on their part must discard their attitudes
of superiority and disregard to welcome the help extended by their
Chinese-educated brethren. </p>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-007#69:3>
<p> What is needed is for men and women of goodwill on both sides -
Singaporeans knowledgeable about their own cultural traditions and yet
receptive to the ideas and values of others - to come together, as cultural
brokers almost, to negotiate meeting of the two cultures.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-007#70:3>
A working group of sensitive, sincere and stout-hearted people from
both sides could sit down to reflect, share, plan and create activities that
will penetrate the self-sufficiency of the English-educated Chinese and in
the process, re-examine and re-express their attitudes and beliefs.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-007#71:3>
This exercise in retaining and transmitting the values that
have served the nation well is something that cannot be left to time or
chance.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-007#72:3>
Wisely directed, it can serve as the beginning for a coming together
of all Singaporean cultures that will lead to the articulation of a set
of particularly Singaporean values that all the people can live by. </p> </I>
<I>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-007#73:4>
<h> <bold> A balance of interests </bold> </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-007#74:4>
<p> DEPUTY Prime Minister Ong Teng Cheong made an important point on
Wednesday night when he spoke about the need for the Government to pay equal
heed to the interests of all racial, language and religious groups.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-007#75:4>
Speaking at a Chinese Press Club dinner, he said English-educated
Singaporeans must understand that the Government cannot answer
all their needs without regard to those of the other groups.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-007#76:4>
The Chinese-educated, he explained, had felt ignored and shown their
unhappiness at the ballot box.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-007#77:4>
Given his seniority in the political leadership and his feel for the
Chinese ground, no one should under-estimate the strength of feelings
that must have led the Government to come out openly to signal to the
Chinese-educated that it is sensitive to their feelings and would do
what it can to fulfil their aspirations. </p> <X>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-007#X78:4>
<p> Yet two points can be made about this assessment.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-007#X79:4>
First, it is by no means settled judgment that the Chinese-educated
felt or still feel alienated because they regard themselves as having been
short-changed all along just because they are Chinese-educated.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-007#X80:4>
If indeed they were alienated, there might well have been other
reasons.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-007#X81:4>
Or, to look at the issue from another angle, just how important was
the perceived preferential treatment of the English-educated a factor in the
way the Chinese ground voted?

<ICE-SIN:W2E-007#X82:4>
No one can say for sure, which suggests caution in interpretation
and follow-up action.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-007#X83:4>
A number of factors must have gone into the way people voted, and it
is difficult to separate these and assign them relative weights.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-007#X84:4>
However, it cannot be denied that the Chinese intelligentsia is
indeed concerned over what it sees as the increasing dominance of English in
Singapore, evident not only in the language being the key to education and
employment opportunities, but also in the way changing values have put
Chinese language and culture on the defensive.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-007#X85:4>
The PAP, as a party that represents all the major interests in
Singapore, cannot but be responsive to that concern. </p>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-007#X86:4>
<p> The second question is this.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-007#X87:4>
No matter how important Chinese ground support has been, and still
is, to the PAP, its relative value will itself decrease as more and more
Singaporeans choose and use English as their first language.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-007#X88:4>
Thus it cannot have escaped the PAP that the risk is there of it
alienating the increasing numbers of English-educated if it should slip in
balancing the various, and sometimes competing, interests.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-007#X89:4>
It is perhaps a comment on the times that any party ruling Singapore
today has no choice but to maintain an equilibrium between the Chinese-
educated, broadly equated with being more conservative, and the
English-educated, seen generally as being more liberal. </p>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-007#X90:4>
<p> There can be no easy answers.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-007#X91:4>
This country is not the exclusive preserve of any racial, linguistic
or economic group.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-007#X92:4>
It is necessary for each to recognise the importance of others in
that common national effort called Singapore.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-007#X93:4>
Mr Ong's intention in talking openly about the needs of the
Chinese-educated was obviously not to suggest any dramatic changes.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-007#X94:4>
More than anything else, his was a timely reminder to everyone of
possible fault lines in society and the need to prevent them from opening up
further.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-007#X95:4>
But the solution lies not in changing what has served Singapore so
well all these years.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-007#X96:4>
To maintain a fine balance of competing interests, all groups must
know when not to overstep the limits, or be too strident in voicing their
own.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-007#X97:4>
The Chinese-educated must recognise and accept that Singapore's
position in the international economic grid necessitates the continuation of
English as the language of business and administration.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-007#X98:4>
The English-educated, on their part, must acknowledge the need for
give-and-take and do nothing that will lead other groups to feel deprived of
their fair share of the fruits of Singapore's success.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-007#X99:4>
Singapore is about symbiosis - whether that is written in Chinese,
Malay, Tamil or English. </p> </X> </I>
