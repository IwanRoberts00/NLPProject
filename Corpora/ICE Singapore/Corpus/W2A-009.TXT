<h> BATIK: CREATING AN IDENTITY By Lee Chor Lin </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-009#2:1>
Batik is a resist-dyeing technique used to decorate finished fabrics.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-009#3:1>
Used by dyers of different ethnicity, cultural background and
historical experience, it can be found in almost all continents, though
rarely as the primary method for producing decorated fabrics.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-009#4:1>
The process of batik is simple but tedious: on a piece of plain
fabric, motifs are delineated using a paste-like substance derived from rice,
beans, mud or wax.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-009#5:1>
The clean space around this paste-covered area is now the background
of a motif.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-009#6:1>
When immersed in a dye bath, the motif that is outlined will resist
the dyeing, while the clean space now absorbs the colour of the dyestuff.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-009#7:1>
Once the paste is cleaned off, the motif is shaped by the undyed
negative space on the cloth.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-009#8:1>
A second colour may be added to the motif if the cloth is dipped into
another dye bath, this time, with the entire background space covered with
the paste so as to resist the second dyeing.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-009#9:1>
Most batik are dyed with two to three colours and every colour takes
one round of resist-application and dyeing.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-009#10:1>
The process has to be repeated as many times as there are colours
required.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-009#11:1>
Batik is not a widely practised technique in Southeast Asia.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-009#12:1>
In the mainland of Southeast Asia, batik is used by the Tai speaking
peoples who began to migrate from Southwestern China into Indochina and
Thailand around the 17th century.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-009#13:1>
Here batik is rendered with a rice paste resist on homespun and
home-woven cotton dyed in indigo.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-009#14:1>
In the island world of Southeast Asia, batik looks very different
from the narrow strips of monochrome fabrics made in the mainland.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-009#15:1>
Used only in limited areas - Java, southern Sumatra and central
Sulawesi - batik of the island world offers more patterns and colours, while
its usage is more widespread than in the mainland.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-009#16:1>
Evidence to relate the mainland batik tradition to that of the island
world is still scarce and highly conjectural.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-009#17:1>
However, it is the Javanese tradition of batik, which was also
introduced to southern Sumatra, that has created the most dynamic and
prolific range of fabrics.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-009#18:1>
Here batik became not just a simple dyeing technique, but the name of
the fabric is also identified with the people of Java.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-009#19:1>
Those areas associated through trading network with Java and southern
Sumatra are also included as part of this batik culture.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-009#20:1>
This book focuses on the batik culture within and outside Java: a
culture that is maintained on an almost addictive passion for the brilliant
colours and dynamic figures created by batik.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-009#21:1>
<h> Batik in Java </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-009#22:1>
Despite its importance in Javanese culture and economy, the early
history of batik in Java is not well recorded.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-009#23:1>
The use of the copper-spout called canting to fix the resist on cloth
is known as batik tulis in Java.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-009#24:1>
Literally this means " to write" or " to draw".

<ICE-SIN:W2A-009#25:1>
When Javanese literature of the 12th-century mentions coloured
fabrics with terms like tulis warna, or randi tinulis, one is uncertain if
these referred to batik ( Christie.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-009#26:1>
1990 1617), although the possibility is very high.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-009#27:1>
These terms could also mean the direct application of dyes on the
fabric.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-009#28:1>
Foreign travellers mentioned that cloth was produced in Java.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-009#29:1>
The Chinese apparently knew that the Javanese wove both silk and
cotton textiles during the ninth and tenth centuries.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-009#30:1>
Wang Dayuan, a Yang Dayuan, a Yuan-dynasty harbour-master, made two
trips to maritime Southeast Asia during the early 13th century and wrote in
Daoyi zhilue ( completed around 1349) that the people in east Java produced a
printed fabric that was fine and extremely colourfast ( jixijian naise
yinbu).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-009#31:1>
At Pekalongan ( Bajienajian), he also identified with conviction
another printed cloth with patterns whose colour " would not run" ( huayinbu
butuise).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-009#32:1>
Unfortunately his rather condensed writing does not provide details
on the production of these fabrics.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-009#33:1>
These two entries do suggest that Javanese could have been printing
their own textiles with patterns, for the word hua ( meaning " flower") when
used together with other textile terms, implies the presence of colours as
well as patterns.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-009#34:1>
They are by no means the first mentions of batik, but seem to suggest
that though Indian printed cotton fabrics were prized goods sought after by
Indonesians during this period, there was very likely a fabric-printing
industry in Java during the 14th century.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-009#35:1>
The printing technique may have started with the direct application
of dyes with woodblocks or stamps.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-009#36:1>
It is possible that Javanese batik derives from block-dyeing rather
than the use of resist-application.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-009#37:1>
Yet Wang's conviction that the colour " would not run" certainly
suggests that the dyeing technique would have been more sophisticated than a
simple direct application of dye.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-009#38:1>
Immersing a cloth in a dye bath completely, as in batik, secures the
colour better.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-009#39:1>
Java's batik tradition nonetheless remains hazy until much later.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-009#40:1>
If one takes the argument expounded by KRT Hardjonagoro, Indonesia's
best-known expert on batik, that the art of batik took its formal shape
during the reign of Sultan Agung Hanyokrokusumo in the early 17th century
Mataram kingdom ( Solyom.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-009#41:1>
1984: 40), then Wang Dayuan's hasty notes about the printed cloth
would refer to the prototype that developed into the art which the Mataram
rulers promoted.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-009#42:1>
It is from this later period that many of the classical batik
patterns and motifs, dyed in a brown and blue colour scheme, were created,
identified and institutionalised by the Mataram kingdom of central Java.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-009#43:1>
When batik styles crystalised in the Mataram kingdom, it would most
probably have taken the form we see today with patterns drawn on white cloth
by the use of a canting with melted wax.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-009#44:1>
The cotton cloth would have been imported from India or from local
cultivation.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-009#45:1>
The Mataram kingdom merged six to seven centuries of selection and
adaptation of HinduBuddhist ideas, like those expressed on monumental
achievements like Borobudur and Prambanan in central Java.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-009#46:1>
Indeed the Mataram kingdom can be viewed as the blue-print for modern
Javanese culture.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-009#47:1>
Classical style batik provides a continuity of aesthetics from that
kingdom.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-009#48:1>
Trade goods that appear in the various parts of Java were also very
important and inspiring sources for batikmakers.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-009#49:1>
Motifs that appeared on silks from China and printed cotton from
India were translated onto batik.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-009#50:1>
Later these external elements became adopted as part of the rich
vocabulary in batik.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-009#51:1>
While exotic foreign items were sought after by the upper echelons of
Javanese society as prestigious indicators of wealth and social position, the
rest of the Javanese population were acquainted with the cheaper range of
imported goods.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-009#52:1>
The batik industry prospered in the face of competition imposed by
other textiles.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-009#53:1>
In fact, cheaper printed cottons from India and Europe were always
available in the market.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-009#54:1>
The issue of the existence of production in the north-coast ( the
Pasisir) aside, central Javanese batik were certainly found in bulk, in major
towns of the coast, like Semarang ( Lombard, D.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-009#55:1>
1989: 274).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-009#56:1>
The History of Sir Stamford Raffles, who wrote the tome during the
early years of the 19th century, contain probably the earliest detailed
descriptions of the technique and the fabric.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-009#57:1>
The coloured plates published in the two-volume work are perhaps the
most often used historical visual evidence of the fabric, seen through
western eyes.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-009#58:1>
By the mid-19th century, the cities of the Pasisir emerged as
important batik centres, where many workshops were started and managed by
non-Javanese: Arabs, Chinese,Europeans and IndoDutch Eurasians.The Swedish
Explorer Carl Bock claimed that in Surabaya, east Java, tulis batik was the
principal industry for the women ( Bock, 1870:10).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-009#59:1>
There was much encouragement from the local leadership and the Dutch
colonial government.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-009#60:1>
The import of machine woven cotton from Holland was an important
factor in contributing to the visual definition of batik.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-009#61:1>
The fine weave of European machine woven cotton provided a smooth and
tight surface for complex patterns to be drawn on.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-009#62:1>
The Chinese in Java seemed to have been involved in much of the
pretreatment of cotton cloth and in the dyeing process ( Vuldy 1987: 104).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-009#63:1>
By the early 20th century, their workshops were responsible for large
quantities of various qualities of batik.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-009#64:1>
The invention of metal blocks for waxing batik motifs initiated a
revolutionary change in the batik industry of Java, by increasing the volume
of production.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-009#65:1>
The golden age of batik probably commenced from this point up to the
World War 11.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-009#66:1>
Batik of this period are the best representation of Javanese artistic
achievement and of the social significance of the Javanese society.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-009#67:1>
The scale of batik production and its usage inside and outside of
Java made batik a very cosmopolitan fashion expression which should be
examined as an important segment of the history of textiles and fashion of
this region.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-009#68:1>
After the Second World War, Java no longer claimed monopoly over the
export of batik.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-009#69:1>
As early as the first decade of this century, weavers and dyers in
Trengganu and Kelantan of east coast Malaysia were experimenting with cap
batik with carved wooden blocks to make cheaper clothing materials for the
general rural population.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-009#70:1>
Confronted by the rise of other regional fabric production, Javanese
batik development went through an interesting phase during which Indonesian
nationalism brought batik back into the realm of statecraft and identity
formation, as in the 17th century Mataram.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-009#71:1>
Designing batik patterns, packaging batik under brand names,
tailoring batik into western-style garments and household product are traits
that led the batik industry towards the internationalisation of a traditional
fabric.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-009#72:1>
Parallel to these new developments, small scale cottage industry
continued to support the demand of local markets.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-009#73:1>
In recent years screen printing of batik patterns on either cotton or
synthetic fabrics has come into the market at cheaper prices, thus posing a
serious threat to hand-drawn and stamped batik.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-009#74:1>
On the other hand, a number of small batik workshops along the
Pasisir have retired their cap, while continuing to make tulis batik.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-009#75:1>
Some of these are meeting local demands, while others fill order from
larger batik export agents and design houses with fine quality batik.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-009#76:1>
Reproductions designs copied from old batik seem to be a popular
though costly trend developing in segments of the contemporary batik
industry.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-009#77:1>
Some interpret and mix design elements with different fabrics and
weaving techniques, for more variety and texture.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-009#78:1>
Contemporary batik seems to be enjoying a renaissance while working
its way into the mainstream vocabulary of the international fashion world.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-009#79:1>
<h> Understanding Batik </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-009#80:1>
As batik is most frequently used to decorate sarung and kain panjang,
two basic garments worn in Java and most of the island world, the motifs and
patterns are composed to be viewed when worn on the body.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-009#81:1>
For example, the width of the kepala of a sarung is measured to
occupy either the front or the back of the wearer, while the badan's length
is calculated so that after folding, it forms the counterpart of the kepala
on the wearer's body.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-009#82:1>
The uniformity of the colours that appear on a cloth is important.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-009#83:1>
This quality is best achieved by dyeing, whereby the entire fabric
waxed with patterns, is dipped in a dye bath to absorb the dye.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-009#84:1>
It is different from applying the dyes with a brush as in painting.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-009#85:1>
Unrestricted by the mechanical construction of patterns on weavings,
batik gives ample space for creativity.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-009#86:1>
Insofar as pattern-building is concerned, batik is similar to
painting, where inspirations from all sources can be instantly translated
onto the white cloth; while the dyeing and the eventual completion of the
cloth is as regular as any textile dyeing.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-009#87:1>
As a dyeing technique, batik nonetheless provides ample flexibility
for the makers to create a wide range of motifs.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-009#88:1>
These motifs may be derivations of objects of very different media -
woodcarvings, ceramics, embroideries, weaving patterns, as well as basketry;
while some may be expressions of aesthetic or visual concepts, as of the
figurative renderings found on altar hangings ( tokwi), Dutch compagnie batik
as well as the famous sea animal and Indramayu batik.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-009#89:1>
Patterns on batik, whether generated by canting or by cap are seldom
identical, for there are so many possibilities for mixing and matching motifs
and colours. <X>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-009#X90:1>
One motif can be interpreted in many different ways by varying the
size and colour, by adding minor decorative details, by combining motifs or
design elements and through the different technical accomplishments of the
individual batik-makers.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-009#X91:1>
The classic example to illustrate the dynamics of batik motifs is
the parang rusak motif.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-009#X92:1>
Decreed by the rulers of the central Javanese kingdoms of Surakarta
( Solo) and Yogyakarta in the 18th century as a " forbidden" motif members of
royalty, the parang generic is the generic name for a group of diagonal
motifs ( garis miring) containing at least 30 variations. </X> </I>
