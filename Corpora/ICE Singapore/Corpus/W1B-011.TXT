Dearest Regina,

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#3:1>
<h> Examinations </h>

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#4:1>
I have just finished my business computing ( 74.100) exam and my
commercial law ( 02.100) exam.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#5:1>
It has been tough but I feel that I have done pretty okay for those 2
papers.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#6:1>
I will not get distinctions but will probably get Bs.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#7:1>
My next paper is on Thursday and it is Micro Economics ( 13.100).

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#8:1>
I am frightened half to death!

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#9:1>
Its one of my worst subjects, the other being Macro Economics.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#10:1>
I am just praying for a pass for these 2 papers.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#11:1>
I will be busy studying so my next letter to you would probably be
after the whole exam.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#12:1>
But do keep your letter coming please!!

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#13:1>
<h> Meetings </h>

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#14:1>
I have not been to the meetings two weeks prior to exams and have not
gone during exam period.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#15:1>
I eat, sleep and dream facts I have to remember.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#16:1>
If I go to the meeting, I probably end up reciting the facts to
myself and not pay attention.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#17:1>
Anyway, I didn't want to trouble Stuart to take me to the meetings as
he is studying too.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#18:1>
So I end up not going.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#19:1>
I will go regularly once the horrifying exams finish and I still
retain my sanity.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#20:1>
The stress is pretty high as everyone seems to be studying and
studying all the time.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#21:1>
I feel the strain.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#22:1>
But don't worry, I am fine.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#23:1>
<h> Job </h>

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#24:1>
My job has 2 training sessions and I just went for one of them.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#25:1>
The theoretical session was interesting and I had a lot of questions,
more so than the others as I am a foreigner.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#26:1>
The 2 managers talked about the purposes of Student Job Search and
how they are there to protect students' interest and find them jobs worthy of
doing.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#27:1>
The lowest wage rate is
&dollar;6.12 gross an hour of
&dollar;5.22 nett an hour.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#28:1>
Any lower and we are not to accept the jobs offered by employers.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#29:1>
We were also to watch out for discrimination against women, the
Maoris, ethnic groups ( like myself!) and any other forms of discriminations.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#30:1>
Incidentally, I am the only Chinese and the only overseas student
employed to work at Student Job Search as an employment officer.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#31:1>
It is a coveted job, I heard from various students!

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#32:1>
It seems I am the cat who got the cream!!!

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#33:1>
I also found out that most of the employment contractual period is up
to 31st 1994 or 31st Jan 1995.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#34:1>
I have my employment period to 10th Feb.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#35:1>
1995.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#36:1>
Not bad, eh?

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#37:1>
The people I am going to work with seems to be friendly and very nice
people.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#38:1>
The managers are very helpful too.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#39:1>
So I can see that I am going to enjoy working here ( I hope!).

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#40:1>
Stuart is still having his bible study with Brother Fook regularly,
even during exam period.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#41:1>
He didn't even think of stopping during this time.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#42:1>
Quite impressed, I was indeed.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#43:1>
He may get a part-time job after the exams but even if he doesn't, he
gets unemployment benefits,
&dollar;134.69 a week.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#44:1>
( I know the figures because I as an employment officer, am supposed
to advise these university students as to how much they are getting and where
to apply for these benefits.)

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#45:1>
So he will be surviving all right!

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#46:1>
<h> Movies </h>

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#47:1>
I went to see two movies, one called " Threesome' and the other one
is Heavenly Creatures.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#48:1>
Both are pretty arty-farty, if you know what I mean.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#49:1>
Threesome is about 2 guys and 1 girl who shared a dorm flat together
by accident.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#50:1>
One of the guys like the girl, and the girl likes the other guy and
the other guy likes his male room mate.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#51:1>
Thus a real love triangle is formed.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#52:1>
It's about the three of them discovering who they really are.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#53:1>
A pretty well-filmed picture.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#54:1>
There were two scenes where there was an orgy - the three of them
having sex together.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#55:1>
It would have been sordid if not for the artistic filming and
editing.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#56:1>
The other movie is a movie based on a real life murder that happened
in 1956 in New Zealand, Christchurch.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#57:1>
Two teenage girls conspired to kill one of the girl's mother.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#58:1>
They were only 15 years old.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#59:1>
They formed a close friendship and lived half in the real world and
half in fantasy.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#60:1>
There was a hot scene where they realised they loved one another (
lesbianism creeping in).

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#61:1>
Then one of the girls had to go away to South Africa and the other
girl's mother did not allowed her to go with her.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#62:1>
( Of course not!

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#63:1>
No sane mother would!) Anyway, they then conspired to kill her, as
they see her as an obstacle to their being together.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#64:1>
Both were arrested and convicted of first degree murder as the murder
was well planned in one of the girl's diary.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#65:1>
With mensrea ( intention to kill) proven, it was murder.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#66:1>
Both were too young for death penalty, so were incarcerated in
different prisons.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#67:1>
One was released in 1959 ( 3 years later) and joined her mother
overseas.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#68:1>
The other was released in 1965.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#69:1>
Both were released on the condition they must never meet each other
again.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#70:1>
It was a very good movie.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#71:1>
I liked it more than threesome as it had more depth.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#72:1>
Moreover,it was based on a true story.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#73:1>
So, What do you think?

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#74:1>
I don't think these two movies will be shown in Singapore.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#75:1>
Even if they are, it be rated R(A).

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#76:1>
That's all that is happening over here, to me, that is.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#77:1>
Oh yes, I have received my money from dad.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#78:1>
Meanwhile, take care and keep writing.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#79:1>
All my love,

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#80:1>
Susanna

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#81:1>
PS: Reg, could you check my Chalet School series and HIGHLIGHT those
that I don't have.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#82:1>
Please send the List back to me ASAP.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#83:1>
I have enclosed the list for you to highlight & send back to me.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#84:1>
THANKS! </I>

Dearest Regina,

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#86:2>
27th October 1994

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#87:2>
My major exams are finally over!!!

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#88:2>
Just one more paper to go, which is maths.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#89:2>
I have 9 days to study for that so no problem, could even aim for am
A.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#90:2>
But you know, my maths have never been strong, so I will be happy
with a B.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#91:2>
In fact, I am hoping to get all Bs at least.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#92:2>
My training session is on tomorrow.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#93:2>
And them I start work on Monday.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#94:2>
I work daytime and study maths night time.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#95:2>
Not bad, eh?

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#96:2>
Don't worry, I am taking care of myself.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#97:2>
I will be attending the meeting this Sunday.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#98:2>
First one since my exams started.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#99:2>
I have never realised that exams could be so stressful!!

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#100:2>
But, believe it or not, I enjoy the stress!!!

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#101:2>
Regina, could you be a kind soul and buy me 2 boxes of the oil of
Ulan light cream that you use?

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#102:2>
I have run out of it.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#103:2>
I know it's expensive so put it on my tab.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#104:2>
I will pay you back as soon as I finished my degree and have a job.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#105:2>
Thank you so...oooooo much!!!

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#106:2>
You don't have to post it to me.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#107:2>
I can make do with my remaining clinique moisturizer.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#108:2>
The cream is so much better for my skin though.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#109:2>
Just pass the 2 boxes to Kalthom.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#110:2>
She will be back in Singapore from the 6th November.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#111:2>
She will bring them to NZ for me in February.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#112:2>
I am telling you early so that if you don't have the money, you can
save for it ! ! !

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#113:2>
Isn't that good of me?

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#114:2>
By the way, WHERE ARE YOUR LETTERS?

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#115:2>
WHY HAVE THEY STOPPED COMING?

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#116:2>
ARE YOU ALRIGHT?

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#117:2>
IS LEANNA ALRIGHT?

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#118:2>
ARE YOU SURVIVING WITHOUT ANY ADMIRERS?

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#119:2>
OR HAVE YOU GOT A NEW BEAU?

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#120:2>
IS EVERYONE AT HOME HAPPY?

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#121:2>
HOW'S MUM?

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#122:2>
HOW'S EVERYBODY????

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#123:2>
ARE YOU HAPPY?

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#124:2>
So there!!

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#125:2>
Enough questions for you to answer in your next letter.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#126:2>
Write ASAP!!!

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#127:2>
All my love,

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#128:2>
Susanna

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#129:2>
PS: Stuart says 'Hi' to everyone. </I>

<I>

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#130:3>
Dear Reg,

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#131:3>
28/4/95

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#132:3>
Heard from Jo that your relationship is on-&-off.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#133:3>
Heard from mum that your relationship is off and you are now trying
to recover from a broken heart.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#134:3>
Er...

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#135:3>
how bad is it?

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#136:3>
Have you really fallen really hard for Teng Hong?

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#137:3>
Nevermind, no matter how painful it is, you'll recover in time,(I
believe?!)

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#138:3>
Mum's letter implied that he broke it off.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#139:3>
Why?

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#140:3>
Did you quarrel?

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#141:3>
Or is it Aunty Loke?

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#142:3>
I know she does not approve of your relationship.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#143:3>
But she's an interfering old sop so ignore her.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#144:3>
Do write and let me know if you are on or off.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#145:3>
Jo's been sending me paper articles on the arrests.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#146:3>
How is everyone?

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#147:3>
Hope everyone is okay.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#148:3>
Mum says you have been a good girl.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#149:3>
Thanks for that.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#150:3>
But then I have always know you would 'rise to the occasion', when
needed.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#151:3>
I have been studying hard.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#152:3>
Law test this Thursday and I have a lot to memorise.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#153:3>
Sometimes I wonder how Victor survived law school.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#154:3>
Law SUCKS!!

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#155:3>
Time is passing pretty fast for me.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#156:3>
I feel as if it is zooming!

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#157:3>
Before I know it, it's almost May.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#158:3>
My days are full of lectures, tutorials, work and study.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#159:3>
Have not been regular at meets.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#160:3>
No excuses, just being lazy and it's too cold to go anywhere!

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#161:3>
It's bet.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#162:3>
11oc to 18oc ( very seldom) and my feet gets frozen!

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#163:3>
Hands too!

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#164:3>
Anyway, as I promised mum, I'll try to be really regular.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#165:3>
Jo told me to appreciate the freedom of worship here and I guess I
have started to take it for granted.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#166:3>
Stuart is very ( extremely) regular for his bible study.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#167:3>
But, he doesn't quite like meeting.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#168:3>
So I'm trying to encourage him so that I get a ride to the kingdom
hall and back.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#169:3>
Meanwhile, take care and all my love,

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#170:3>

Dearest Regina

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#172:4>
3/3/96

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#173:4>
so...

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#174:4>
who's your new love now, or is it still Matthew?

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#175:4>
How's life and how are you?

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#176:4>
We have settled in quite nicely & we have just finally finished
unpacking.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#177:4>
We only managed to move into 5/14 Whitaker Place only on the 22nd
Feb.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#178:4>
School started on the 26th Feb so we didn't have time to unpack.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#179:4>
We spent 4 days unloading our boxes & suitcases ( we got some from
the space station - about 30 boxes of all sized.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#180:4>
Then during the week I unpack, attended lectures and started
assignments.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#181:4>
Because of the semester system, exams are only 12 weeks away.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#182:4>
Imagine cramming 1 year's work into 12 weeks!

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#183:4>
We have to start studying immediately.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#184:4>
No loafing at all.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#185:4>
2nd week of school & I have 4 assignments to hand in.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#186:4>
I feel as if I am sinking.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#187:4>
This is worse than 2nd year.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#188:4>
Hope I can cope this year.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#189:4>
Anyway, we will write you some more later.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#190:4>
Meanwhile, do write soon.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#191:4>
Here's and old 1¢ NZ coin, not in Production anymore.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#192:4>
I found this on the ground.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#193:4>
( You know - see a penny, pick it up, all day long you have good
luck!) Keep it properly.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#194:4>
It's very hard to get hold of another like it.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#195:4>
will send you the
&dollar;2 coin later.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#196:4>
We need it for laundry.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#197:4>
Sorry.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#198:4>
All my love to mum, gong gong, Jared & Leanna.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#199:4>
Tell Leanna I'll write her soon.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#200:4>
Take care.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#201:4>
All my love,

Dear Regina,

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#204:5>
Received your letter yesterday.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#205:5>
Your grumbling is noted.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#206:5>
Won't bug you again.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#207:5>
I need you to do me a favour.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#208:5>
The Chalet school has a fan club in Australia which I can join.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#209:5>
I need my updated list of chalet school books.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#210:5>
They are in one of my box & tick those I have on the list I am
sending with this letter.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#211:5>
Some of the books are currently unavailable.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#212:5>
I need a list so I can order those I don't have.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#213:5>
I know you are busy but please do this 1 favour for me.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#214:5>
THANK YOU!

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#215:5>
( Please don't wait 'til Armagadden to send me the list!)

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#216:5>
Jared tells me you are thinking of coming over to NZ for sometime.
<X>

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#X217:5>
Look forward to you being here.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#X218:5>
Stuart is rather excited as he wants to show you his true self over
here, as well as show you <X> all N.Z.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#X219:5>
Do write soon with the list.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#X220:5>
Thanks.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#X221:5>
Take care and happy moving.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#X222:5>

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#X225:5>
I did update my CS booklist when I was in Singapore, but I lost it
can't find it.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#X226:5>
Appreciate your help.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-011#X227:5>
P/S: included some phone cards for you. </X> </I>
