<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#20:1:A>
Not much of a help

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#21:1:B>
Not much of a help

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#22:1:A>
I mean two of us that uhm well

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#23:1:B>
No you can you can nuh threaten to uh uh fire her

<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#24:1:B>
Maybe she doesn't do her work

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#25:1:A>
Oh I mean I'm sure she will but then uhm for two us cos it
require a lot of manpower and a lot of marker work

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#26:1:B>
Uhm uhm

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#27:1:A>
Maybe you should get my boss to do it

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#28:1:B>
Yap

<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#29:1:B>
But I already scare her a bit

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#30:1:A>
Ya I'm trying to get Lay Peng to come back to help out also

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#31:1:B>
Uhm uhm

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#32:1:A>
<unclear> word </unclear> because of her expense

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#33:1:B>
Ya right

<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#34:1:B>
Or maybe once in a while when she needs a break from her books

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#35:1:A>
Ya

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#36:1:B>
Then well

<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#37:1:B>
So what's new other than work

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#38:1:A>
Well Dr <unclear> word </unclear> has been keeping loads and
loads of rats as you know

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#39:1:B>
Uh

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#40:1:A>
Do you know that Seow Choo is now his uhm PhD student

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#41:1:B>
Is it

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#42:1:A>
Yep

<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#43:1:A>
He's doing his PhD under him

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#44:1:B>
Under who

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#45:1:A>
Dr Tee

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#46:1:B>
Oh boy that's in uh that's interesting

<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#47:1:B>
I mean it's oh

<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#48:1:B>
Actually she was an RA right

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#49:1:A>
Ya she was an RA but uhm <unclear> word </unclear>

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#50:1:B>
Was she working for a degree then or just not

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#51:1:A>
No she wasn't she wasn't and they uh actually she was supposed
to be hired under him

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#52:1:B>
Uhm uhm

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#53:1:A>
As an RA but I guess they wanted to save cost and asked her to
convert it to a a PhD by research

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#54:1:B>
Uhm uhm

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#55:1:A>
So she's looking around for a scholarship

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#56:1:B>
Oh I see

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#57:1:A>
<unclear> word </unclear>

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#58:1:B>
Uhm uhm

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#59:1:A>
To buy more equipment

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#60:1:B>
Uhm uhm

<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#61:1:B>
Are they actually working on the same uh

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#62:1:A>
They're working on the rat <unclear> word </unclear>

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#63:1:B>
Uhm uhm Uhm

<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#64:1:B>
Oh about uh the Wednesday evening's dinner I probably not join you

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#65:1:A>
Oh why

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#66:1:B>
Oh oh actually this week I'm really busy with uh work to
complete and I guess I shall miss the fun

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#67:1:A>
Oh you mean they've been uhm pushing you and all that

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#68:1:B>
No no no but uh there are some things I need to sort of sort
out and no I just in the process of sorting out the stats all those uh
terrible stats pile so

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#69:1:A>
different tests and all that

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#70:1:B>
Uhm uhm ya

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#71:1:A>
Oh

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#72:1:B>
So I thought that I should spend more time on it

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#73:1:A>
But don't stay too late

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#74:1:B>
Uhm well it's nice

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#75:1:A>
But it's quite uh dangerous for you to go out late at night in
that sense

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#76:1:B>
Not really because I can take the MRT from my uh from the the
bus-stop outside the engineering blocks

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#77:1:A>
The MRT

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#78:1:B>
Uh sorry I mean duh I'll take ninety six and then I'll go the
MRT station so it's not that bad

<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#79:1:B>
It's not like a long walk compared to before and I had to take like
one nine seven <&>  197 </&> one nine eight <&>  198)

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#80:1:A>
Uhm ya sounds ya <unclear> word </unclear>

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#81:1:B>
Uhm

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#82:1:A>
But you still do you still have to walk through that little
path with the palm trees and all that

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#83:1:B>
Palm trees

<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#84:1:B>
Uhm

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#85:1:A>
or I think coconut trees

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#86:1:B>
Oh no no usually I'll go by the uh on the the sixth level
where they have the yellow roof you know that part

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#87:1:A>
Uh

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#88:1:B>
Is it

<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#89:1:B>
I mean the palm trees is where uhm like near YIH right

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#90:1:A>
Ya

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#91:1:B>
Uhm I don't go through that way

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#92:1:A>
Oh you don't go through that way

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#93:1:B>
Nope

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#94:1:A>
Oh it's the one that's just uhm opposite arts is it

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#95:1:B>
Uhm opposite O what

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#96:1:A>
Arts uh uhm central library

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#97:1:B>
Uhm ya ya ya right

<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#98:1:B>
Uhm uhm

<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#99:1:B>
Ya so in a way it's quite convenient

<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#100:1:B>
Ya so long as I don't go to the thirty three <&>  33 </&> bus-stop I feel
safer

<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#101:1:B>
You know the one that's behind

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#102:1:A>
The one that's behind

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#103:1:B>
Uhm uhm the one that's uhm like you have to go down the long
flight of steps and then you go through I mean it's like with all trees and
bushes and

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#104:1:A>
Oh ya

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#105:1:B>
Uhm

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#106:1:A>
So

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#107:1:B>
Uhm uhm

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#108:1:A>
So what have you been doing besides work

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#109:1:B>
Well uh guess what

<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#110:1:B>
For the weekend I spent the entire weekend sorting photographs

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#111:1:A>
Oh for me to see

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#112:1:B>
Ya sort of uhm I'll probably bring them in one day and trying
to find one that has got a clear picture of the the the face of a girl I told
you about

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#113:1:A>
Oh

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#114:1:B>
So that uh you'll probably be able to see it better

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#115:1:A>
Uhm

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#116:1:B>
Because the rest of it are pretty blur

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#117:1:A>
Oh how come

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#118:1:B>
Ya uhm guess not well taken and I don't have too many of it

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#119:1:A>
Oh

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#120:1:B>
I only have like uh maybe one or two clear ones

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#121:1:A>
Okay so <unclear> word </unclear> so should I expect you to
carry in a big note

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#122:1:B>
Oh no no no

<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#123:1:B>
I'm just going to bring maybe one

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#124:1:A>
Only one nuh

<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#125:1:A>
I thought you'll show us your album

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#126:1:B>
Oh ya I can

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#127:1:A>
<unclear> word </unclear>

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#128:1:B>
I can but not I mean the rest will not be on her though

<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#129:1:B>
The rest will be like uh very scenery sort of un you know crazy
things that I did

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#130:1:A>
Oh but I want baby <unclear> word </unclear> too

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#131:1:B>
Oh well I don't have any

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#132:1:A>
You don't have any

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#133:1:B>
Right

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#134:1:A>
Not even one

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#135:1:B>
No the oldest or rather the youngest I have is six

<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#136:1:B>
So if you consider that as a baby

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#137:1:A>
Well never mind that will do

<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#138:1:A>
I can imagine

<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#139:1:A>
My little exhibit

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#140:1:B>
Ya right

<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#141:1:B>
Oh

<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#142:1:B>
Okay someday I'll bring it

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#143:1:A>
When will you be coming down again

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#144:1:B>
Uhm don't know

<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#145:1:B>
Not at this point

<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#146:1:B>
I guess maybe when I start working at NUH again

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#147:1:A>
Oh

<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#148:1:A>
Will it take long

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#149:1:B>
Hopefully in the next two weeks

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#150:1:A>
Oh that depends on how fast you finish your analysis is it

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#151:1:B>
Uhm uhm

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#152:1:A>
I see

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#153:1:B>
Or rather depends on Prof Ong

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#154:1:A>
Oh when when he decides to have space for you

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#155:1:B>
Uhm uhm ya

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#156:1:A>
At first recently they've been having a lot of short courses
and speakers from <unclear> word </unclear> and all that

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#157:1:B>
Uhm uhm

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#158:1:A>
<unclear> word </unclear> uh he's always showing people
around

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#159:1:B>
Uhm oh

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#160:1:A>
And and Dr Ng has been using the room quite frequently

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#161:1:B>
Uhm uhm

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#162:1:A>
So even if you come I think you'll be slightly disturbed by
him

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#163:1:B>
Oh oh

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#164:1:A>
There's this group of students coming in and <unclear> word
</unclear>

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#165:1:B>
But I guess I won't be using much of that room because uh
since this is going to be at the workplace you know the workstation of
whoever is going to participate

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#166:1:A>
Uhm

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#167:1:B>
Then so it looks like most of the time except for the uhm
calibration which can be done not necessary in that room

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#168:1:A>
Uh huh

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#169:1:B>
It can be done outside too

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#170:1:A>
Oh

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#171:1:B>
And the rest of it uhm who will done at the subjects' uh work
workstation

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#172:1:A>
And so you'll be running around carrying all your equipment
and all that

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#173:1:B>
Uhm ya maybe or rather the subject will be running around

<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#174:1:B>
Ya with the electrodes on

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#175:1:A>
I see oh but do you have to bring a new brief case of
electrodes and stuff like that

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#176:1:B>
Uhm you mean over to NUH from here

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#177:1:A>
Uhm no to your subjects

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#178:1:B>
Uh no no no

<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#179:1:B>
They'll be in other words uhm after they finish up their
calibration which you know I could always do it outside

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#180:1:A>
Uh

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#181:1:B>
uhm near where you work

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#182:1:A>
Uh huh

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#183:1:B>
Then uhm after that she's free to move about and this time
it'll be quite different in the sense that she won't have those uhm like the
angle equipments attached so she'll only have like uh six electrodes attached
to her and that's it

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#184:1:A>
Ya

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#185:1:B>
So probably will be <unclear> word </unclear> on made easier
for her to move around

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#186:1:A>
Uh huh

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#187:1:B>
Ya

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#188:1:A>
<unclear> word </unclear> computer to monitor her movement
and all that

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#189:1:B>
Oh

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#190:1:A>
She has to cart that around you see

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#191:1:B>
Ya but that would be placed at the workstation

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#192:1:A>
Oh

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#193:1:B>
At uh huh you know where wherever she works

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#194:1:A>
Get them to provide you with the laptop

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#195:1:B>
Ya that was what I was thinking

<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#196:1:B>
Maybe you could borrow one from your department

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#197:1:A>
<O> laughs </O>

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#198:1:B>
Uhm uhm

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#199:1:A>
Ya it'll be a lot more convenient than carting one <unclear>
word </unclear>

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#200:1:B>
Ya in fact the spot I used when I was in nuh HP

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#201:1:A>
Oh that's because Alex is there and then

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#202:1:B>
Uhm uhm

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#203:1:A>
<unclear> word </unclear> give you laptops and all that
<unclear> word </unclear>

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#204:1:B>
Uhm uhm ya

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#205:1:A>
<unclear> word </unclear> probably a personal laptop

<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#206:1:A>
Well you can ask you can borrow from Dr Tee

<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#207:1:A>

And he finally finished his notes so he can take a breather
for a while but Hadiah says she's chasing him

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#222:1:B>
What notes

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#223:1:A>

<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#225:1:B>
Hah

<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#226:1:B>

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#227:1:A>
So he has to produce a set of notes

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#228:1:B>
Uhm uhm

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#229:1:A>
So Hadiah has to chase him each time for the notes because
it's late

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#230:1:B>
Oh boy

<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#231:1:B>
He probably has too much to say

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#232:1:A>
But I mean he actually he's involved in so many things

<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#233:1:A>
He's got so many projects running at same time

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#234:1:B>

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#235:1:A>

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#236:1:B>

For I don't know what they are doing but at the moment the
poly student is doing a lot of calculations

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#238:1:B>

<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#246:1:A>
Then he said oh he just want to test his limits

<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#247:1:A>

After all he's talented so uh gifted so so you know got to squeeze
every bit out of him

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#252:1:A>
Ya I guess it's alright for him because he's still single and
all and all that

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#253:1:B>

<ICE-SIN:S1A-095#254:1:A>
