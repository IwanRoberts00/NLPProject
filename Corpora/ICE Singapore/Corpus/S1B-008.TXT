<I>

<$A>
<ICE-SIN:S1B-008#1:1:A>
You can sit here if you want

<ICE-SIN:S1B-008#2:1:A>
I can't see that

<$B>
<ICE-SIN:S1B-008#3:1:B>
Where

<$A>
<ICE-SIN:S1B-008#4:1:A>
Okay so you had more time to prepare

<$C>
<ICE-SIN:S1B-008#5:1:C>
Yah

<$A>
<ICE-SIN:S1B-008#6:1:A>
What do you think are the what do you were are the problems
with section five which have either been solved or not solved

<ICE-SIN:S1B-008#7:1:A>
Can we just go through a list of them David

<$D>
<ICE-SIN:S1B-008#8:1:D>
I think there's still the difficulty of <unclear>
word </unclear> that issue if you

<$A>
<ICE-SIN:S1B-008#9:1:A>
Okay

<$D>
<ICE-SIN:S1B-008#10:1:D>
Use the <unclear> word </unclear> 's evidence to 
quote

<$A>
<ICE-SIN:S1B-008#11:1:A>
Okay so so take so try to think of it as a kind of 
a a
structure okay

<ICE-SIN:S1B-008#12:1:A>
I mean number one you must know the cases prior to the 
amendment

<ICE-SIN:S1B-008#13:1:A>
What were the problems with this thing prior to the 
amendment okay

<ICE-SIN:S1B-008#14:1:A>
And then has each one of these problems been solved by 
the
<unclear> word </unclear> Amendment

<ICE-SIN:S1B-008#15:1:A>
If so how if it hasn't why or has it created new 
problems I mean I mean that's the basic structure which which I want you to look 
at

<ICE-SIN:S1B-008#16:1:A>
Okay you you say it hasn't solved the framing of the 
issue of question why

<ICE-SIN:S1B-008#17:1:A>
<O> cough </O>

<$D>
<ICE-SIN:S1B-008#18:1:D>
Because there's there's been no direction made out 
as to uhm how you <&> telephone rings </&> how you frame the issue

<$A>
<ICE-SIN:S1B-008#19:1:A>
Hello yah hi Debbie nope no why on what how about 
yourself not
coming uh not coming is it

<ICE-SIN:S1B-008#20:1:A>
That's what announcement do you want

<ICE-SIN:S1B-008#21:1:A>
Okay I'll ask her you don't want them is it

<ICE-SIN:S1B-008#22:1:A>
Michael is doing a lecture

<ICE-SIN:S1B-008#23:1:A>
Uhm ya I think

<ICE-SIN:S1B-008#24:1:A>
Okay don't don't don't too much

<ICE-SIN:S1B-008#25:1:A>
It's semi-terrorism

<ICE-SIN:S1B-008#26:1:A>
We'll tell Michael okay

<ICE-SIN:S1B-008#27:1:A>
I'll tell him whether you need them but uh ya it's okay

<ICE-SIN:S1B-008#28:1:A>
Bye Okay framing of <unclear> word </unclear>

<$D>
<ICE-SIN:S1B-008#29:1:D>
Uhm

<$A>
<ICE-SIN:S1B-008#30:1:A>
Are you still reading that one

<$B>
<ICE-SIN:S1B-008#31:1:B>
No I just I need the three act the acting one

<$A>
<ICE-SIN:S1B-008#32:1:A>
Uhm you should read the other one lah

<$B>
<ICE-SIN:S1B-008#33:1:B>
Uhm

<$A>
<ICE-SIN:S1B-008#34:1:A>
Which I'm sure your have read

<$B>
<ICE-SIN:S1B-008#35:1:B>
Uhm

<$A>
<ICE-SIN:S1B-008#36:1:A>
Okay yes David go on

<$D>
<ICE-SIN:S1B-008#37:1:D>
Because uh compared to the prior to the amendment there's an an uh new <unclear> 
word </unclear> and a and amendment uhm there's there's no additional 
instruction laid down as to how you should approach and frame the issue

<$A>
<ICE-SIN:S1B-008#38:1:A>
Okay so you you're starting out by assuming that framing the issue of question 
is a problem uh

<$B>
<ICE-SIN:S1B-008#39:1:B>
Uhm

<$A>
<ICE-SIN:S1B-008#40:1:A>
I assume

<$D>
<ICE-SIN:S1B-008#41:1:D>
Yes

<$A>
<ICE-SIN:S1B-008#42:1:A>
So will you think that there're different levels of framing the issue

<ICE-SIN:S1B-008#43:1:A>
At certain levels if you frame the issue it could possibly question of issue 
<unclear> word </unclear> other levels no 

<ICE-SIN:S1B-008#44:1:A>
But what do you think uh Su Ann

<ICE-SIN:S1B-008#45:1:A>
Will you have problem

<$B>
<ICE-SIN:S1B-008#46:1:B>
Not very sure uhm I think it depends on which approach you want to uh you want 
to take

<ICE-SIN:S1B-008#47:1:B>
If you set the actions approach which seems to be the 
favourite approach nowadays then you don't have to

<$A>
<ICE-SIN:S1B-008#48:1:A>
Uhm you see that's one way of actually without 
looking at the <unclear> word </unclear> amendments trying to solve the problem 
within the cases itself

<ICE-SIN:S1B-008#49:1:A>
That that's one way of seeing

<ICE-SIN:S1B-008#50:1:A>
Well the problem only exists under Lon and Dalton's approach

<ICE-SIN:S1B-008#51:1:A>
If you look at <unclear> word </unclear> 's way of framing or frame
the issue of question then the problem won't exist

<ICE-SIN:S1B-008#52:1:A>
Anything

<ICE-SIN:S1B-008#53:1:A>
And and how would you do it yah

<$C>
<ICE-SIN:S1B-008#54:1:C>
For acting's approach got to oh you know what 
<unclear> word </unclear> all is

<$A>
<ICE-SIN:S1B-008#55:1:A>
Ah okay that that could be a problem or okay that 
that see that's a problem which will not exist for uh would never have existed 
under <unclear> word </unclear> 's approach

<ICE-SIN:S1B-008#56:1:A>
But now exists under Atkins' approach

<ICE-SIN:S1B-008#57:1:A>
And the problem is even if you were to say that okay 
that that's the first first difficulty right framing of issue of question

<ICE-SIN:S1B-008#58:1:A>
Let's go on to the next one

<ICE-SIN:S1B-008#59:1:A>
We'll sort of follow from what you said earlier on

<ICE-SIN:S1B-008#60:1:A>
Number one Atkins if you follow Atkins approach in 
framing the issue of question I want you to know the meaning of multicarlaw

<ICE-SIN:S1B-008#61:1:A>
That has not been settled

<ICE-SIN:S1B-008#62:1:A>
Of course unless the legislative said we leave it to 
the cases to decide I mean basically it's the Common Law that <unclear> word 
</unclear> that gives us law

<ICE-SIN:S1B-008#63:1:A>
Not really satisfactory but but you know there's been 
an entire range of dicta right

<ICE-SIN:S1B-008#64:1:A>
Some cases say well mercantile law's not the same as 
law merchant then you've got <unclear> word </unclear> <unclear> word </unclear> 
<unclear> word </unclear> and the and the earlier ones I mean <unclear> word 
</unclear> the whole range of definitions from mercantile law plus you see under 
Lord Dalton's approach this would not have been a problem at all because the law
there would have meant English law

<ICE-SIN:S1B-008#65:1:A>
Okay but if you take the words with respect to those 
matters as having qualified the law with strictly to with strictly to mercantile 
law then again the definition of mercantile law becomes important you see which
again is non-settlement yah but the law any problem Siew Hwa

<ICE-SIN:S1B-008#66:1:A>
The law with respect to those matters

<ICE-SIN:S1B-008#67:1:A>
Was it necessary

<ICE-SIN:S1B-008#68:1:A>
Any anything it solves

<$E>
<ICE-SIN:S1B-008#69:1:E>
Uhm the word law itself

<$A>
<ICE-SIN:S1B-008#70:1:A>
Be that the law the applicable law see you covered 
the <unclear> word </unclear> you covered the definition what about the
applicable law

<ICE-SIN:S1B-008#71:1:A>
Has that been settled

<ICE-SIN:S1B-008#72:1:A>
Was it a problem as the amendment have

<$E>
<ICE-SIN:S1B-008#73:1:E>
It's still a problem

<$A>
<ICE-SIN:S1B-008#74:1:A>
<O> cough </O> Why

<$E>
<ICE-SIN:S1B-008#75:1:E>
Has it has it to do with the section

<ICE-SIN:S1B-008#76:1:E>
You're talking about written law

<$A>
<ICE-SIN:S1B-008#77:1:A>
No no no not that section

<ICE-SIN:S1B-008#78:1:A>
The applicable law uhm the law which comes in via 
section five

<$D>
<ICE-SIN:S1B-008#79:1:D>
Well it seems that I think the amendments is 
trying to qualify that the law the law can be applied in Singapore

<$A>
<ICE-SIN:S1B-008#80:1:A>
Okay so again you have two diff conflicting approaches under

<ICE-SIN:S1B-008#81:1:A>
You have to explain the problem

<ICE-SIN:S1B-008#82:1:A>
Lord Dalton's approach the whole law of English the 
whole of English sort of come in Atkins' approach only mercantile law does come 
in

<ICE-SIN:S1B-008#83:1:A>
So you've got two different approaches

<ICE-SIN:S1B-008#84:1:A>
Now again has that been settled by the <unclear> word 
</unclear> amendment

<ICE-SIN:S1B-008#85:1:A>
So divided the words with respect to this matter

<ICE-SIN:S1B-008#86:1:A>
You see for each one of them you start out by saying 
okay number one there were two different approaches

<ICE-SIN:S1B-008#87:1:A>
Was there a problem I mean was it was it a conflict or 
was it more of a a <unclear> word </unclear> you know was there a conflict

<ICE-SIN:S1B-008#88:1:A>
If there's a conflict it's <unclear> word </unclear>

<ICE-SIN:S1B-008#89:1:A>
If there's no conflict then <unclear> word </unclear> 
amendments really <unclear> word </unclear>

<ICE-SIN:S1B-008#90:1:A>
Do you uh you don't have to say everything was a 
problem

<ICE-SIN:S1B-008#91:1:A>
You may say that I think although that <O> telephone 
rings </O>

<ICE-SIN:S1B-008#92:1:A>
Hello hello yep okay alright thanks bye

<ICE-SIN:S1B-008#93:1:A>
You see just remember if it's not a conflict at all 
then you don't have to to go on and really try to see whether it solve the 
problem like like for example let me take a more fundamental point

<ICE-SIN:S1B-008#94:1:A>
Do you think that the two approaches are in conflict 
with one another

<$D>
<ICE-SIN:S1B-008#95:1:D>
Yes

<$A>
<ICE-SIN:S1B-008#96:1:A>
Do you think the approaches are conflicting enough

<ICE-SIN:S1B-008#97:1:A>
Think carefully I mean if you say that they are 
conflicting approaches fine uhm bear in mind except Lord Atkins says he does not 
disagree with Lord Dalton

<ICE-SIN:S1B-008#98:1:A>
Do you think they are conflicting approaches

<ICE-SIN:S1B-008#99:1:A>
You may argue they are conflicting in the sense that 
they lead to totally different results or someone may argue that well they're 
not really conflicting they are the same

<ICE-SIN:S1B-008#100:1:A>
It's just that the starting point of the entire thing 
is different which actually lead to different results but the approaches are 
itself not conflicting

<$B>
<ICE-SIN:S1B-008#101:1:B>
But I don't I don't see how the approaches are the same

<$A>
<ICE-SIN:S1B-008#102:1:A>
Okay it's the same issue of question okay the law 
can be applied okay qualification correct

<$B>
<ICE-SIN:S1B-008#103:1:B>
But the law we applied is different

<$A>
<ICE-SIN:S1B-008#104:1:A>
Only because when you frame the issue of question 
you frame the issue but or question by looking at the mercan at at the law

<ICE-SIN:S1B-008#105:1:A>
So if the law is mercantile law there'll be a issue of 
question restrict to mercantile law which means the law coming in would be 
mercantile law it has to be

<ICE-SIN:S1B-008#106:1:A>
But the issue in the statute of the question is not 
mercantile law no issue of question with respect to mercantile law it won't come 
in

<ICE-SIN:S1B-008#107:1:A>
Do you follow

<ICE-SIN:S1B-008#108:1:A>
The starting point actually <unclear> word </unclear>

<ICE-SIN:S1B-008#109:1:A>
You will say that that could mean that the approach is 
the same or one could equally argue <unclear> word </unclear> they're completely
different

<$B>
<ICE-SIN:S1B-008#110:1:B>
Oh

<$A>
<ICE-SIN:S1B-008#111:1:A>
Right 'cos it leads to completely different results as in
entire different way because that is not the way Lord Dalton will frame the
issue of question law you know Lord Atkins frames it in a very different way
I mean you can come to completely different results but you you don't have to
sort of take what the book says is correct all the time

<ICE-SIN:S1B-008#112:1:A>
Okay okay uhm the law with respect to those matters

<ICE-SIN:S1B-008#113:1:A>
What used to come in and <unclear> word </unclear> the 
amendments up

<ICE-SIN:S1B-008#114:1:A>
David you said

<$D>
<ICE-SIN:S1B-008#115:1:D>
Yah I think uhm the amendment was trying was 
trying to qualify the law applicable in Singapore because he added in 'with 
respect to those matters' so I would think they would be trying to qualify uh 
the law to maybe laws relating to banking principles and etcetera

<$A>
<ICE-SIN:S1B-008#116:1:A>
Or you can say you think that there was a 
<unclear> word </unclear> and that this makes it clear that not all law comes in 
but only mercantile law comes in

<$D>
<ICE-SIN:S1B-008#117:1:D>
Yah

<$A>
<ICE-SIN:S1B-008#118:1:A>
At this stage I mean you can compare this with 
the object and purpose of section five and and again you got a whole string of 
<unclear> word </unclear> law

<ICE-SIN:S1B-008#119:1:A>
You think the amendment makes it more consistent with 
our object and purpose of section five

<$B>
<ICE-SIN:S1B-008#120:1:B>
It it qualifies the law to be applied to that 
restricted to mercantile law only

<$A>
<ICE-SIN:S1B-008#121:1:A>
Okay fine

<ICE-SIN:S1B-008#122:1:A>
Any other problem on this section ah in in the old uh 
in the amend pre-amendment cases

<ICE-SIN:S1B-008#123:1:A>
Don't don't look at the <unclear> word </unclear> okay

<ICE-SIN:S1B-008#124:1:A>
Look at the cases first

<ICE-SIN:S1B-008#125:1:A>
Ask yourself okay what were all the problems that exist

<ICE-SIN:S1B-008#126:1:A>
Okay you've covered the issue of question okay you covered the law
applicable we've covered the problems of definition of mercantile law we've
covered the question of whether the two approaches are different

<ICE-SIN:S1B-008#127:1:A>
What other problems you think you're interested

<$D>
<ICE-SIN:S1B-008#128:1:D>
<unclear> word </unclear>

<$A>
<ICE-SIN:S1B-008#129:1:A>
Okay <unclear> word </unclear> Okay before we talk <unclear>
word </unclear> can we talk about the general applicability

<ICE-SIN:S1B-008#130:1:A>
Now you remember that was never a problem until <unclear> word
</unclear> 'cos it's it's something they never really have to consider
<unclear> word </unclear>

<ICE-SIN:S1B-008#131:1:A>
No in <unclear> word </unclear> you find that all three courts
don't want the money lent back to the client

<ICE-SIN:S1B-008#132:1:A>
The more important dictas the is to be shift one to the High Court

<ICE-SIN:S1B-008#133:1:A>
I think it's uhm <unclear> word </unclear> very good dictum at the
last paragraph uh that the moneylender side are not capable of this thing
their sections are so interdependent provides for machinery and everything
else

<ICE-SIN:S1B-008#134:1:A>
Now look at the dicta

<ICE-SIN:S1B-008#135:1:A>
They'll give the case okay

<ICE-SIN:S1B-008#136:1:A>
Can you take the last paragraph <unclear> word </unclear>
activities okay

<ICE-SIN:S1B-008#137:1:A>
You have the case with you Su Ann

<ICE-SIN:S1B-008#138:1:A>
You think so

<ICE-SIN:S1B-008#139:1:A>
Good I'm sure you'll find it

<ICE-SIN:S1B-008#140:1:A>
The last para okay no it's it's a very im important point

<ICE-SIN:S1B-008#141:1:A>
The High Court <unclear> word </unclear> activity

<ICE-SIN:S1B-008#142:1:A>
You didn't have it

<ICE-SIN:S1B-008#143:1:A>
Do you have it

<ICE-SIN:S1B-008#144:1:A>
The High Court <unclear> word </unclear> will shakes up

<ICE-SIN:S1B-008#145:1:A>
Can't be that difficult to find

<$B>
<ICE-SIN:S1B-008#146:1:B>
<unclear> word </unclear>

<$A>
<ICE-SIN:S1B-008#147:1:A>
Yah okay read read the last paragraph

<$B>
<ICE-SIN:S1B-008#148:1:B>
Okay uhm I'll like the defence of the real act

<ICE-SIN:S1B-008#149:1:B>
hese acts in question have no white imperial concern 
or <unclear> word </unclear>

<ICE-SIN:S1B-008#150:1:B>
They are very special municipal ways of legislating 
the region creating creating procedure and machinery and setting up restrictions 
and sanctions which are quite impossible to Christian ideas

<$A>
<ICE-SIN:S1B-008#151:1:A>
Okay let's let's just stop there

<ICE-SIN:S1B-008#152:1:A>
Do you think that they're very special municipal ways 
of provision creating procedure and machinery setting up restrictions and 
sections penalty uh

<ICE-SIN:S1B-008#153:1:A>
Ah impossible application okay

<ICE-SIN:S1B-008#154:1:A>
Now ask yourself carefully is this is he talking 
generally about ah acts suitable or not suitable or is he saying that if an act 
creates for procedure and machinery and sets up restrictions and sanctions 
restrictions can be probably licensing and sanctions will be penalty

<ICE-SIN:S1B-008#155:1:A>
Are his remarks directed at a general applicability 
test or he's talking about a specific <unclear> word </unclear>

<$B>
<ICE-SIN:S1B-008#156:1:B>
Moneylender's Act

<$A>
<ICE-SIN:S1B-008#157:1:A>
No not so much moneylender's act

<ICE-SIN:S1B-008#158:1:A>
Is he talking about an act which creates restrictions 
sanctions procedure and machinery

<ICE-SIN:S1B-008#159:1:A>
Is he talking about that <X>

<ICE-SIN:S1B-008#X160:1:A>
Do you know what I mean

<ICE-SIN:S1B-008#X161:1:A>
It's interesting because you you take you see okay 
then you go to look at Lord Atkin Lord okay because he to create this exception 
uhm <unclear> word </unclear> relied on the word perfect law and its application
correct and and that has been discredited so that is all

<ICE-SIN:S1B-008#X162:1:A>
Now Lord Atkin does the same thing Right Lord Atkin 
says the same thing He says oh you know there's an implied exception correct not 
found there but but hid it's an implied <unclear> word </unclear> and this the
thing that Soon and Pang criticise Right they they say that oh section five
it's not possible for section five to have this implied exception not found
within the words of the section itself They criticise that part okay So the
next question we went on to uh the section five three a allow for this
suitability test and to that the answer was no because five three a says
modify and adapt whatever has already come in but the suitability test
applies at the stage where it determines whether not something comes in so
that can't be the one so that that they've argued it as a problem right And
think about it carefully If what um <unclear> word </unclear> activity did
what Lord Atkin wa talking about in fact Atkin's remark was somewhat similar
to her I'm not a general suitability test but they're only talking about acts
which create licensing you know concerned with licensing penalties
registration Is that exception provided in <unclear> word </unclear> </X>

<$B>
<ICE-SIN:S1B-008#X163:1:B>
Ya

<$A>
<ICE-SIN:S1B-008#X164:1:A>
It is you see Do you do you see again it it depends on how you read the cases if 
you say well here they were not I mean they were not so specific as to talk 
about registration
sanctions and and procedure and everything They're talking
about suitability test okay and Lord Atkin talks about the implied suitability 
test not found within the words of section five So that was the problem Where 
did he find the legislative
basis for it Then you ask yourself That's the nineteen seventy nine
amendment solved then Give you the problem now it doesn't really solve that 
right Because Soon and Pang say modify that and that cannot mean suitability But 
if you start out by saying wer um the words uhm which <unclear> word </unclear> 
activity gave and 
Lord Atkin says I'm not a general suitability test but I'll confine to act
s which create procedure and machinery licensing and penalty that has been 
provided for under this amendment so that problem has
been solved as well and there's no need and so the bulk argument as well
there's no need for a general applicability test Well I mean that that's their 
basic premise They say no you don't have to have a general applicability test 
then that is solved but then that depends on how you read it If you read this as 
a wide applicability test then of course you'll have problems later on that's 
all </X> </I>
