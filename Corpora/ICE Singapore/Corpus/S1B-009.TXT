<ICE-SIN:S1B-009#1:1:A>

Good morning I hope you don't mind my starting now 
but we have
quite a lot of materials to get through today alright

<ICE-SIN:S1B-009#2:1:A>

Our last lecture on vicarious liability

<ICE-SIN:S1B-009#3:1:A>

So let's continue there

<ICE-SIN:S1B-009#4:1:A>

Now last week yah I was starting to go through some of 
the rules by
<unclear> word </unclear> when an act of an employee is done within the force
of employment

<ICE-SIN:S1B-009#5:1:A>

As I said the phrase force of employment is used rather 
likely used
in the phrase

<ICE-SIN:S1B-009#6:1:A>

You take care and a lot of things <unclear> word 
</unclear> yah

<ICE-SIN:S1B-009#7:1:A>

As far as I carry the liability of return this phrase 
indicates when
policy would tend to make an employer liable to the act of an employee right

<ICE-SIN:S1B-009#8:1:A>

So first we have to define what the employee's duties 
are that's
logically first step in the analysis

<ICE-SIN:S1B-009#9:1:A>

The next thing is to try to find the connection between 
what the
employee has done and tort to his people complain of and the employer because
at the end of the day we want to make the employer liable right

<ICE-SIN:S1B-009#10:1:A>

Now after talking a little bit about connection I went 
into some
situation because as I say it is the the convention is divide the acts of
employees into two basic types careless acts by the employee

<ICE-SIN:S1B-009#11:1:A>

In other words where the tort arises from a careless 
act of the
employee and deliberate act when the tort was committed deliberately alright

<ICE-SIN:S1B-009#12:1:A>

Because then show differentiation in these two 
categories is
necessary because it much easier to say that the employer is liable where the
tort was merely committed carelessly where the tort was committed
deliberately by the employee then the employer has far better chance of
escaping liability right

<ICE-SIN:S1B-009#13:1:A>

That's the conventional classification and I've already 
talked
about careless acts by the employee right

<ICE-SIN:S1B-009#14:1:A>

Now I'm introducing another category category which I 
think is
useful for our analysis because really there are acts which fall in between
the class careless act by the employee leading to the tort and when we talk
about careless act here we're talking about careless act within the normal
duties of the employee right

<ICE-SIN:S1B-009#15:1:A>

And then there are deliberate tort deliberate tort 
committed by the
employee for which the employer doesn't tend to be liable

<ICE-SIN:S1B-009#16:1:A>

There is what I call intermediate position and the 
terminology is
my own

<ICE-SIN:S1B-009#17:1:A>

This intermediate position has elements of both right

<ICE-SIN:S1B-009#18:1:A>

Where we have intermediate position like this we're 
already talking
about an employee who has deliberately done what he's not supposed to do as
far as his employer's concerned

<ICE-SIN:S1B-009#19:1:A>

He departed from his usual duties deliberately but the 
tort arises
out of his carelessness right

<ICE-SIN:S1B-009#20:1:A>

So different from deliberate tort by the employee 
because the
employee did not actually intend to cause harm right

<ICE-SIN:S1B-009#21:1:A>

It's different from deliberate tort which we're going 
to discuss in
a while

<ICE-SIN:S1B-009#22:1:A>

It's deliberate from the pure careless tort which I was 
discussing
earlier because here the employee isn't so much acting within his normal duty

<ICE-SIN:S1B-009#23:1:A>

He has done something that's a little bit different 
from what the
employee sorry what the employer really intended him to do right

<ICE-SIN:S1B-009#24:1:A>

This intermediate position it doesn't fall nicely into 
either
classification and so I think we can usefully discuss it separately

<ICE-SIN:S1B-009#25:1:A>

Now I <unclear> word </unclear> there were blank looks 
last week
when I'm was making that point sorry last Tuesday so let's just take an
example of what I consider to be intermediate position right

<ICE-SIN:S1B-009#26:1:A>

A case which should be familiar to you right now from 
our lectures
on Richard on sat Richard statutory duty ICI Chapel right

<ICE-SIN:S1B-009#27:1:A>

You remember in that case <unclear> word </unclear> was 
supposed to
follow certain procedures

<ICE-SIN:S1B-009#28:1:A>

They were supposed to follow certain procedures when 
setting off
explosives or sorry when testing connection and things like that

<ICE-SIN:S1B-009#29:1:A>

They decided not to follow these procedures yah and 
there was an
explosion an injury was sustained

<ICE-SIN:S1B-009#30:1:A>

Now the injury was not deliberately caused right

<ICE-SIN:S1B-009#31:1:A>

Nobody actually set out to hurt anybody but there was a 
deliberate
departure on the part of the employees from what they were supposed to do

<ICE-SIN:S1B-009#32:1:A>

They were supposed to test the connection in a certain 
way they
decided not to do it

<ICE-SIN:S1B-009#33:1:A>

They decided to do it in a way which they were told not 
to do it
right

<ICE-SIN:S1B-009#34:1:A>

So this is an illustration of what I call the 
intermediate position

<ICE-SIN:S1B-009#35:1:A>

The harm is not caused deliberately but it flows 
because the
employee has deliberately departed from what should be his proper duty

<ICE-SIN:S1B-009#36:1:A>

Another example of that would be <unclear> word 
</unclear> also a
breach of statutory duty <unclear> word </unclear>

<ICE-SIN:S1B-009#37:1:A>

Look that up yourself

<ICE-SIN:S1B-009#38:1:A>

These cases I think you will recall resulted in the 
employee sorry
in the employer not being vicariously liable right

<ICE-SIN:S1B-009#39:1:A>

There was vicarious the employer's <unclear> word 
</unclear>
vicarious liability there which should be indicate to you that this really
can be treated differently from the pure careless act

<ICE-SIN:S1B-009#40:1:A>

It's very difficult for the employer to escape 
vicarious liability
for a pure careless act occurring as a result of the employee performing his
duties properly if carelessly

<ICE-SIN:S1B-009#41:1:A>

But in this intermediate position it is slightly easier 
for the
employer to escape vicarious liability

<ICE-SIN:S1B-009#42:1:A>

Examples of where the another example of where the 
employer escapes
vicarious liability would be for instance the case of Storey and Ashton right

<ICE-SIN:S1B-009#43:1:A>

This is the case that would be in most of the case 
books so I'll
leave you to look it up yourself except that I'd like you to note that here
it involves someone who has finished his duties he had completed his duties
in other words and what he did was he took a ride yah he took a ride after
that to visit someone

<ICE-SIN:S1B-009#44:1:A>

It was a personal visit using his employee's carriage

<ICE-SIN:S1B-009#45:1:A>

While on the way for this personal visit he got into an 
accident

<ICE-SIN:S1B-009#46:1:A>

Someone was injured

<ICE-SIN:S1B-009#47:1:A>

So was the employer vicariously liable for his 
carelessness here

<ICE-SIN:S1B-009#48:1:A>

The answer was no

<ICE-SIN:S1B-009#49:1:A>

The employee's duties had ended right

<ICE-SIN:S1B-009#50:1:A>

The court used the phrase that ah that employee had 
gone on a
frolic of his own

<ICE-SIN:S1B-009#51:1:A>

This word <unclear> word </unclear> sample phrases that 
I'm
confident will end up in your vocabulary before very long

<ICE-SIN:S1B-009#52:1:A>

Just like phrases like floodgates of liability and very 
often been
misused

<ICE-SIN:S1B-009#53:1:A>

But that really is a phrase which gets used from time 
to time when
we're talking about the employee's duties yah

<ICE-SIN:S1B-009#54:1:A>

The stage he has departed from his duties in a manner 
sufficient to
spare the employer liable

<ICE-SIN:S1B-009#55:1:A>

We often use the phrase the employee went on a frolic 
of his own

<ICE-SIN:S1B-009#56:1:A>

That indicates the connection with the employment it's 
not
sufficient to found vicarious liability right

<ICE-SIN:S1B-009#57:1:A>

As I said the test in these kinds of situation would be 
whether or
not tortious conduct the accident while travelling with your friend yah is
reasonably incidental to the performance of your duties

<ICE-SIN:S1B-009#58:1:A>

In Storey and Ashton it's pretty clear that it wasn't 
reasonably
incidental because the employee had finished doing what he was supposed to do

<ICE-SIN:S1B-009#59:1:A>

He had finished making all deliveries so there was an 
insufficient
connection there

<ICE-SIN:S1B-009#60:1:A>

But no not all departures from duties will amount to a 
frolic

<ICE-SIN:S1B-009#61:1:A>

An example of a case where it wasn't frolic it's 
Whatman and
Pearson which was mentioned earlier

<ICE-SIN:S1B-009#62:1:A>

This is a case where an employee was told not to go 
home for lunch
uh and leave some <unclear> word </unclear> unattended the employee did so

<ICE-SIN:S1B-009#63:1:A>

The horses ran ran wild caused some injury and the 
employer was
held vicariously liable for those injuries even though he <unclear> word
</unclear> from the deliberate departure by the employee from what he was
told to do

<ICE-SIN:S1B-009#64:1:A>

That what I call the intermediate position as I said it 
lies
between deliberate acts and careless acts Careless acts very hard for the
employer to escape vicarious liability

<ICE-SIN:S1B-009#65:1:A>

Deliberate acts more easy for the employer to escape 
vicarious
liability

<ICE-SIN:S1B-009#66:1:A>

An example of a deliberate tort by the employee yah for 
which the
employer was not held liable would be a local case that went up to the Privy
Council Keppel Bus Company and Sa'ad Bin Ahmad

<ICE-SIN:S1B-009#67:1:A>

This is an this is a case from Singapore I I don't 
think many of
you are old enough to remember there was a Keppel Bus Company but this case
really is a stuff which New Paper headlines are made

<ICE-SIN:S1B-009#68:1:A>

Conductor attacks passenger

<ICE-SIN:S1B-009#69:1:A>

That's what happened

<ICE-SIN:S1B-009#70:1:A>

The conductor was one of those that fortunately we 
don't have
anymore yah uhm he was he was abusing a passenger

<ICE-SIN:S1B-009#71:1:A>

The plaintiff like a hero went up and tried to tick the 
conductor
off and got a ticket punched in his eye

<ICE-SIN:S1B-009#72:1:A>

Now this case is really a very good advertisement for 
OMO

<ICE-SIN:S1B-009#73:1:A>

Uhm the plaintiff lost his eye as a result of this 
assault and he
sued the employer right

<ICE-SIN:S1B-009#74:1:A>

As I said there would have been no point in this case 
trying to sue
the employer

<ICE-SIN:S1B-009#75:1:A>

This is a mere bus conductor who would have been 
earning two three
hundred dollars a month yah

<ICE-SIN:S1B-009#76:1:A>

How's he going to make good the loss of the eye

<ICE-SIN:S1B-009#77:1:A>

Answer he can't

<ICE-SIN:S1B-009#78:1:A>

So the plaintiff tried suing the employer Keppel Bus 
Company and
what was decided in that case

<ICE-SIN:S1B-009#79:1:A>

Answer the employee's conduct was deliberate wrongdoing 
by the
employee

<ICE-SIN:S1B-009#80:1:A>

It was deliberate wrongdoing so the employer should not 
be
vicariously liable

<ICE-SIN:S1B-009#81:1:A>

Now another example of a situation where deliberate 
conduct spares
the employer vicarious liability deliberate tort yah would spare the employer
vicarious liability

<ICE-SIN:S1B-009#82:1:A>

It's a fairly similar case Warren and Henley

<ICE-SIN:S1B-009#83:1:A>

This time in England

<ICE-SIN:S1B-009#84:1:A>

A garage station attendant who gets a strange idea in 
his head and
starts accusing a passenger of non-payment sorry uh a customer of not paying
his bill

<ICE-SIN:S1B-009#85:1:A>

Customer gets upset says some things to the to the 
attendant

<ICE-SIN:S1B-009#86:1:A>

Attendant flies into a rage and hits the pa the 
customer

<ICE-SIN:S1B-009#87:1:A>

Now again the court said the employer was not liable 
because this
was an assault

<ICE-SIN:S1B-009#88:1:A>

It was pure vengeance on the part of the employee

<ICE-SIN:S1B-009#89:1:A>

It's not connected with employment

<ICE-SIN:S1B-009#90:1:A>

It's deliberate act and therefore the deliberateness of 
the assault
severed the connection with his employment even though he did it during
office hours yah even though he did it because he was in that position
because he was employed by the by the employer there was still not sufficient
con uh connection

<ICE-SIN:S1B-009#91:1:A>

The deliberateness severed the connection that's 
necessary to make
the employer liable for the tort

<ICE-SIN:S1B-009#92:1:A>

It would be nice if we could say the uh the employer 
was never
liable for deliberate act but I'm afraid life is not so simple because there
are deliberate acts where employers still are liable for the torts right

<ICE-SIN:S1B-009#93:1:A>

One example is Poland and John Parr

<ICE-SIN:S1B-009#94:1:A>

This is a case again on assault where the employee saw 
the
plaintiff and thought the plaintiff was trying to steal the employer's
goodies from all the carriage

<ICE-SIN:S1B-009#95:1:A>

So the employee gave the plaintiff a good hard knock

<ICE-SIN:S1B-009#96:1:A>

The plaintiff fell down under the wheels of the 
carriage and had
his arm broken right

<ICE-SIN:S1B-009#97:1:A>

Uhm in that case however the court said the employer 
was
vicariously liable

<ICE-SIN:S1B-009#98:1:A>

So even though it was a deliberate assault on the part 
of the
employee

<ICE-SIN:S1B-009#99:1:A>

The employer was still vicariously liable

<ICE-SIN:S1B-009#100:1:A>

In other words deliberate conduct doesn't always 
severed the
connection between the tort and the employer

<ICE-SIN:S1B-009#101:1:A>

There may be vicarious liability So when will there be 
vicarious
liability a deliberate conduct and when will the employer escape

<ICE-SIN:S1B-009#102:1:A>

I think the answer lies in looking at the nature of 
the conduct
and whether or not there is benefit to the employer from that conduct right

<ICE-SIN:S1B-009#103:1:A>

Now when we talk about conduct again I would avoid 
defining
conduct too narrowly

<ICE-SIN:S1B-009#104:1:A>

We're not talking about whether or not the employer 
benefited from
the blow being struck by the employee in Poland and Paar right

<ICE-SIN:S1B-009#105:1:A>

We're talking about whether the employee thought he 
was something
for the benefit of the employer in other words guarding the goods right

<ICE-SIN:S1B-009#106:1:A>

Compare that for instance the Keppel Bus Company and 
Sa'ad Bin
Ahmad and Warren and Henley right <X>

<ICE-SIN:S1B-009#X107:1:A>

Those are situations where the conduct clearly didn't 
benefit the
employer The employee was simply doing it for revenge for his own purposes He
wasn't trying to benefit the employer Now in the Privy Council in Keppel Bus
and Sa'ad Bin Ahmad the court mentioned for instance that the plaintiff might
have recovered from the employee employer The employer might have been
vicariously liable if the bus conductor's conduct at that time had been
connected with his duties as bus conductor So if for instance the bus
conductor had been trying to maintain order on an unruly bus passengers were
screaming and shouting He was trying to push people back into the seat right
And he committed an assault in the course of trying to do that then that
would be related enough to his duties that the employer would have been
vicariously liable There is then potentially a connection a connection if a
connection can be made between what the employee is doing and the benefit of
the employer then the employer may still be vicariously liable even though
the tort has been committed deliberately But when you have clear situations
like Keppel Bus Company and Sa'ad Bin Ahmad and Warren and Henley when
assault by the employee were absolute were purely personal there was no
thinking on the part of the employee that I'm doing this for the good of my
employer then the employer would escape vicarious liability for the
deliberate tort of the employee right Simple enough isn't it </X> </I>
