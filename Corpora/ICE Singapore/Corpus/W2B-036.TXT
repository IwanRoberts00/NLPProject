<ICE-SIN:W2B-036#3:1>
A NEW super-pager device for people who need to receive electronic
messages out in the field may be launched soon.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-036#4:1>
It will enable them to receive numerical messages from telephones (
like a normal pager) and electronic mail from desktop PCs.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-036#5:1>
They will need a Hewlett Packard HP 95LX palmtop computer and a
receiving device called the Motorola News Stream.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-036#6:1>
A desktop PC running a special software from Hewlett Packard will be
able to send messages of up to 400 characters to a palmtop or a group of
palmtops anywhere in Singapore.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-036#7:1>
The messages will be automatically directed to update appointments,
spreadsheets, telephone directories and to-do lists in the palmtop.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-036#8:1>
One of the first target groups of users will be forex dealers, who
will be able to receive instantaneous updates of financial information from
Reuters Information Services, HP told Life!

<ICE-SIN:W2B-036#9:1>
It is negotiating with Singapore Telecom and Reuters Information
Services on the details about the new service.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-036#10:1>
Forex dealers can already receive the Reuters service through a
special pager that allows them to see the incoming information line by line.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-036#11:1>
The HP system, however, can display a whole screen of 400 characters
at a time.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-036#12:1>
If the negotiations come through, Singapore will be one of the few
forex markets in the world with this service, HP said.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-036#13:1>
Negotiations for a service in Hong Kong is under way.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-036#14:1>
Launched in April 1990, the HP 95LX has a list price of
&dollar;800 for the 512 kilobyte RAM and
&dollar;1,200 for the new 1 megabyte RAM.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-036#15:1>
But they will be on offer at
&dollar;576 and
&dollar;980 respectively until June 1.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-036#16:1>
The palmtop comes with built-in software such as the MS-DOS
operating system, the Lotus 1-2-3, an advanced financial calculator, data
communications software, a memo-editor, phone book and appointment book.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-036#17:1>
The Motorola NewsStream receiver, which costs
&dollar;500, is sold separately. </I>

<h> How safe is your system? </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-036#19:2>
Despite proposed laws against misuse, computers everywhere are at
risk

<ICE-SIN:W2B-036#20:2>
by Grace Chng

<ICE-SIN:W2B-036#21:2>
On Mar 6, an electronic virus named Michelangelo struck computer
systems around the world, wreaking untold havoc.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-036#22:2>
A fortnight ago, two hackers in the US pleaded guilty to breaking
into computer systems in what US authorities termed " crimes of the future".

<ICE-SIN:W2B-036#23:2>
Meanwhile, a 19-year-old British youth was found not guilty for
breaking into computer systems including those of the Ministry for Defence.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-036#24:2>
Singapore is not immune to the activities of such criminals.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-036#25:2>
And it is to protect against them that the proposed computer misuse
law was introduced earlier this month in parliament.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-036#26:2>
The Computer Misuse Bill is intended on cracking down on computer
crimes here as well as those crimes committed from outside the country via
telephone lines but affect systems in Singapore.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-036#27:2>
According to Prof Chin Tet Yung, Dean of the Law Faculty, National
University of Singapore, laws against computer misuse were not introduced
earlier because " the problem had not become that great even on a global
basis".

<ICE-SIN:W2B-036#28:2>
The laws are now needed here as Singapore is in an advanced stage of
its computerisation programme.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-036#29:2>
The threat will be increased as Singapore implements IT2000, a
blue-print that will see Singapore criss-crossed by electronic highways which
are ultimately plugged into global networks.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-036#30:2>
These electronic links can be accessed by a hacker anywhere in the
world equipped with only a computer.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-036#31:2>
" This seems remote," said Prof Chin, " but once we are
electronically linked to the rest of the world, such activities can happen".

<ICE-SIN:W2B-036#32:2>
Prof Chin, who is also the chairman of the sub-committee on computer
technology and the law at the Singapore Academy of Law, sees enormous
security risks in the proliferation of networking in organisations.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-036#33:2>
He cited an example: " A medical database contains patients' data
available only to doctors.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-036#34:2>
But what if someone gains unauthorised access to the data and changes
vital information such as medication?

<ICE-SIN:W2B-036#35:2>
Lives can be endangered".

<ICE-SIN:W2B-036#36:2>
The laws, when they come into effect, will help deter misuse,
especially by casual hackers.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-036#37:2>
But laws can do only so much to protect computer users.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-036#38:2>
Organisations need to take preventive measures to protect from data
loss and virus attacks, and also against computer frauds and breakdowns.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-036#39:2>
Said Prof Chin: " What is more necessary than laws is the creation of
awareness among computer professionals and users on the need for security".

<ICE-SIN:W2B-036#40:2>
Certainly, awareness has been growing in recent years, as reflected
in the increasing number of computer security conferences here.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-036#41:2>
Media publicity on the Michelangelo and other viruses as well as
offenders who access computer systems illegally have also helped in damage
control.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-036#42:2>
Mr Chew Teck Soon, a partner with management consultants Coopers and
Lybrand, believes that with the mushrooming of international data networking,
there needs to be an authority that can police the flow of information across
borders.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-036#43:2>
This is still a very grey area at the moment, he said.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-036#44:2>
" Countries have incorporated it into their legislation in terms of
defining their scope of where and what they can prosecute".

<ICE-SIN:W2B-036#45:2>
The recently introduced Computer Misuse Bill has included this
trans-border data flow crimes.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-036#46:2>
The bill covers offences on computer systems here or committed from
outside the country via telephone lines.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-036#47:2>
Beyond that, Prof Chin of NUS's Law Faculty sees a need for a " code
of conduct for computer professionals not only for security but also for data
protection and privacy".

<ICE-SIN:W2B-036#48:2>
Added Coopers' Mr Chew: " The group of young adults proficient in
computers is growing.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-036#49:2>
If the ethics of these people is not managed well, we stand a greater
risk of a juvenile delinquent breaking into a system here".

<ICE-SIN:W2B-036#50:2>
At the end of the day, however, the toughest laws and the most
sophisticated security system will not keep out the most determined of
criminals.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-036#51:2>
The problem then is having people who know how to nab the electronic
criminals.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-036#52:2>
The traditional policeman is no longer enough.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-036#53:2>
The new-age law enforcer is more likely to be the savvy computer
wizard who understands electronic pulses and cyberspace - - the area between
two computers - - to be a hacker. </I>

<h> Inside DOS 6 </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-036#55:3>
DOS 6, the long-awaited update to the most widely-used operating
software in the world, DOS 5, is now out.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-036#56:3>
Francis Chin gives it the once-over.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-036#57:3>
Microsoft's DOS version 6 is now available.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-036#58:3>
DOS, or Disk Operating System, controls the entire working of the
personal computer, from the XT to the top-of-the-line 486/66 machine.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-036#59:3>
Currently, almost users have MS-DOS 5 in their PCs.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-036#60:3>
There is only one competitor's operating system, known as DR-DOS ( DR
stands for Digital Research), which can replace Microsoft's system.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-036#61:3>
DR-DOS is more powerful, has more features and functions, and is no
more difficult to use than MS-DOS.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-036#62:3>
Very few people have heard of DR-DOS because of poor or non-existent
promotion and marketing.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-036#63:3>
MS-DOS 6 is intended to solve two common problems: insufficient
conventional memory and a full hard disk.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-036#64:3>
<h> Conventional memory </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-036#65:3>
All PCs running on DOS have only 640 kilobytes of processing memory
to access and handle application programs.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-036#66:3>
This 640K is the limit, regardless of the millions of bytes of RAM
you may have put inside the machine.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-036#67:3>
So, you have the weird but very common situation in which you have 4
million bytes of RAM and your computer uses only 640,000 bytes.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-036#68:3>
The other 3,380,000 bytes appear to be idle and quite useless.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-036#69:3>
Meanwhile, of the 640K, a bit goes to handling your mouse, a bit goes
to taking care of your sound card, a bit goes to disk-caching ( faster
transfer of data from the hard disk to the processor) and a bit goes to other
devices hooked to the PC.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-036#70:3>
All these bits add up and usually you are left with say 550K of
conventional memory.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-036#71:3>
When you start your favourite word processor programme or flight
simulator game, you get this message on screen: insufficient memory.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-036#72:3>
You read the box cover of your game again and there in small print it
says: This game requires 600K of memory.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-036#73:3>
Drat!

<ICE-SIN:W2B-036#74:3>
For a company thought to be run by pretty smart people, you wonder
why Microsoft gives you the dumb 640K limit, leaving out those millions of
bytes you still have in the rest of your RAM chips.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-036#75:3>
In MS-DOS 5, Microsoft tried to redeem itself by creating upper
memory segments, expanded memory and extended memory.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-036#76:3>
All those bits of memory needed for your mouse, disk-cache, sound
card and other devices can be taken from upper memory which is something
above the 640K conventional memory.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-036#77:3>
With odd commands like DEVICEHIGH and LOADHIGH, you now have 610K,
which is just adequate to fly your F-15 simulated jet over Baghdad, complete
with the roar of the after-burners and the whistling of the wind over your
Plexiglass cockpit.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-036#78:3>
The new MS-DOS 6 offers more of the same memory juggling feature
which now goes by the fancy name of MemMaker.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-036#79:3>
Already in the past week since a review in Singapore, power users are
name-dropping MemMaker in their conversation the way you toss ketchup on
stale spaghetti.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-036#80:3>
Personally, I do not see much difference in what Memmaker can do
compared with what MS-DOS 5 has already accomplished.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-036#81:3>
<h> Hard-Disk Capacity </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-036#82:3>
It is an iron-clad law that data and application programmes expand
faster than the hard disk can store them.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-036#83:3>
Three years back, a 40MB hard disk was quite capacious; now a 200MB
disk ( at
&dollar;900) is barely enough.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-036#84:3>
Now Microsoft says that with MS-DOS 6, you can temporarily halt this
madness of changing your hard disk every year.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-036#85:3>
It offers a feature, called DoubleSpace, which squeezes the data
inside the hard disk to half their normal size, in effect doubling the
storage.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-036#86:3>
So a 200MB disk becomes a virtual 400MB, using DoubleSpace.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-036#87:3>
The squeeze on your data is safe and you need not bother how it
works.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-036#88:3>
Now you can throw away Stacker 3.0 ( if you are using a pirated copy
bought for
&dollar;5 at Katong Shopping Center), a special software from Stac Electronics that
does basically the same thing.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-036#89:3>
There is something not quite right here: originally Microsoft wanted
to use the Stacker technique for its DoubleSpace.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-036#90:3>
It discussed this with Stac Electronics, then said it could do it
without Stac's assistance.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-036#91:3>
Stac has since sued Microsoft in a Los Angeles court for alleged
stealing of its patented techniques and using them in DoubleSpace.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-036#92:3>
Microsoft officials in Singapore say what is employed inside
DoubleSpace has nothing to do with Stac's patents.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-036#93:3>
But they declined to comment further.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-036#94:3>
<h> Other features </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-036#95:3>
DOS 6 throws in lots of extras to make your daily housekeeping chores
less tedious.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-036#96:3>
* Backup facility ( in a DOS and Windows version) for fast backup of
data from the hard disk to floppies and tapes.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-036#97:3>
* Anti-virus protection scheme to scan, detect and destroy viruses.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-036#98:3>
* Undelete to bring back to life the file you have deleted.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-036#99:3>
* Defrag for " unfragmentising" files and data that are scattered in
a mess on the hard disk.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-036#100:3>
* Three new commands for the C prompt - - MOVE, DELTREE and CHOICE.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-036#101:3>
<h> Prices </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-036#102:3>
The DOS 6 package that you can buy off the shelf is for upgrading
only.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-036#103:3>
This means that your computer must have already been running any
earlier version of DOS.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-036#104:3>
The installation of DOS 6 will overwrite the old systems files.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-036#105:3>
DOS 6 is priced at
&dollar;99.95. 

<ICE-SIN:W2B-036#106:3>
Microsoft Corporation says all major PC manufacturers are
expected to pre-install DOS 6 in their new machines.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-036#107:3>
So, should you move to DOS 6?

<ICE-SIN:W2B-036#108:3>
If you have just bought a PC, definitely.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-036#109:3>
If you are already using DOS 5 plus pirated versions of utility
software like PC tools, Norton Desktop and Stacker, definitely.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-036#110:3>
But if you have bought original copies of the above utilities (
which can total over
&dollar;500), do not make the switch just yet.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-036#111:3>
Wait and see. </I>

<h> 3Com Palm III: Death of the Filofax? </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-036#113:4>
Palm Computing, Inc., a 3Com company has produced the third
generation of its award-winning and highly popular Palmpilot: the Palm III.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-036#114:4>
With more than a million units of its predecessor the PalmPilot sold
worldwide, this latest gadget looks set to become the preferred product for
digital organiser users here and abroad.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-036#115:4>
The new palm III looks much sleeker, with softer edges all around
and even a protective flip cover to make this essential gadget look like a
Star Trek Tricoder only slimmer. <X>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-036#X116:4>
Weighing in at just 6 ounces, this " can-do" machine comes with 2
megabytes of memory, stores 6,000 addresses, 1,500 " to-do" items, 1,500
memos, 200 e-mail messages, and 3,000 appointments.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-036#X117:4>
what's more, it features improved handwriting recognition and
infra-red capabilities for easy data transferral.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-036#X118:4>
The Palm III's organiser applications include a date book, address
book, mail, " to do" list, memo pad, expense, calculator, games, and a
HotSync feature for easy exchange of data to and from your desktop computer.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-036#X119:4>
Now all you need is a teleport device to beam you from the
thousands of places you have to be today.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-036#X120:4>
I've thought of enquiring with 3Com but I don't think they are
working on it yet.
