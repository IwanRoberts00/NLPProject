<ICE-SIN:W2B-033#3:1>
The Anglo-Chinese School's 'smart' card is a versatile piece of
plastic.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-033#4:1>
It has a magnetic strip that stores up to
&dollar;50 in credit and is bar-coded so that it can be used as a library card.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-033#5:1>
It also serves as a school identity card.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-033#6:1>
" We use it everywhere; in the canteen to buy food, in the bookshop
and library, for photocopying.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-033#7:1>
I can't imagine doing without it", enthused Shon Mathew, 12, a Sec 1
student.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-033#8:1>
When the card was introduced last June, students bowled over by its
usefulness, dubbed it 'smart' even though it lacked the one essential
prerequisite of its truly 'smart' counterpart - a computer chip.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-033#9:1>
According to property manager Mr Wong Wei Li, the school decided to
introduce the card because it wanted to give students a taste of the future.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-033#10:1>
" We thought it would give students hands-on experience of a cashless
society.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-033#11:1>
A cashless school seemed the best way". The GiroVend system installed
in the school is imported from Britain while the cards are manufactured
locally.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-033#12:1>
The system consists of an 'organisation unit' - its brain.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-033#13:1>
The unit's hardware components include a standard keyboard, a desktop
processor and printer that can display up to 24 characters and a magnetic
card reader and writer.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-033#14:1>
All cards originate from this unit which encodes the card holder's
number and the monetary value.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-033#15:1>
Mini portable tills, each with a keyboard, microprocessor and reader
are plugged into electrical outlets at all stalls in the canteen, in the
library and the bookshop.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-033#16:1>
When the card is swiped through the reader the available balance
appears on the display screen.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-033#17:1>
The operator then keys in the purchase amount which is deducted and
the new balance appears on top.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-033#18:1>
The system also includes a top-up machine called a loader which
accepts cash and adds to the card's value.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-033#19:1>
According to the card's manufacturer, Computer-Forms Toppan Moore,
the organisation unit costs about
&dollar;10,000 while a mini till costs
&dollar;7,00l. 

<ICE-SIN:W2B-033#20:1>
There is no doubting that the card has scored points within
the school for various reasons.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-033#21:1>
It has stilled boys' complaints about lost money or about being
shortchanged at the canteen.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-033#22:1>
When a card is reported lost, it is 'blacklisted' to render it
useless.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-033#23:1>
Canteen operator Miss Goh Ming Keow is happy because she does not
have to count coins at the end of each day.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-033#24:1>
For librarian Mrs Vadevaloo Sushila, the card is a time-saver: "
Earlier, we had to keep written records of all files.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-033#25:1>
Now, students just use the card".

<ICE-SIN:W2B-033#26:1>
According to Mr Wong, parents have added their praise.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-033#27:1>
" Previously, when the boys brought cash to school, parents were
never sure about how the money was spent.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-033#28:1>
Now, they don't have to worry about their kids bingeing at fast food
joints".

<ICE-SIN:W2B-033#29:1>
He says that the next step is to capture identity details of each
student and employee on the magnetic strip: If it is feasible, we will go
ahead".

<h> Variations on a computer </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-033#31:1>
<h> Composer Yan Hui-Chiang creates while his Atari system takes it
down </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-033#32:1>
By EVA WONG

<ICE-SIN:W2B-033#33:1>
Composer Mr Yan Hui-Chang used to agonise over a moment of
inspiration and its long journey to paper - until he found his bridge over
troubled water in a computer.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-033#34:1>
" In the past, I would get this inspiration, a tune or a feeling in
me.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-033#35:1>
I'd try to write the notes down, but that took longer than what was
going through my head, so some of it was lost," Mr Yan, 39, said in Mandarin.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-033#36:1>
And if I was at a piano, I could play what's in my head, but when I
was through, there's nothing to show for it.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-033#37:1>
It was frustrating!"

<ICE-SIN:W2B-033#38:1>
Then two years ago, he discovered computer-generated music.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-033#39:1>
The composer was then the principal conductor and artistic director
of the Beijing Central Chinese Orchestra, conductor of the Beijing Concert
Hall Philharmonic, guest professor of the China Music Conservatory and
composer of several award-winning orchestral compositions in China.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-033#40:1>
Beijing Stone, a Chinese computer company, invited him to be its
music director, to test its new computer products and software which helped
create music.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-033#41:1>
" Many of the older composers and conductors were suspicious of
computers," he said.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-033#42:1>
" But I saw its virtues when they demonstrated to me what it could
do".

<ICE-SIN:W2B-033#43:1>
Mr Yan, who is now music director at KK productions, a recording
company here, has cut two albums of his own compositions in the past year.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-033#44:1>
The albums " The Moon" and the " Clouds", unlike his previous
classical works, combine orchestral and synthetic sound.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-033#45:1>
They demonstrate how closely the system can imitate the sound of
nature and musical instruments, and how new sounds can be created by
modifying the computer's sound modules.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-033#46:1>
" The sound modules put so many sounds and variations at my
fingertips," said Mr Yan, who can play virtually every instrument in a
Chinese orchestra, and some Western ones as well.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-033#47:1>
The system's ease of use means music composition is put into the
hands of the non-musician.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-033#48:1>
" But I would like to think you need some musical ability before the
music gains acceptance," he said.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-033#49:1>
<h> How the system works </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-033#50:1>
Mr Yan Hui-Chang uses an Atari system in his recording studio.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-033#51:1>
The system is installed with the Sealab Notator software which
translates digitally what he plays on a synthesiser into a music score which
can be read on the computer screen.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-033#52:1>
The system also captures the pressure on each key, the volume, tempo
and timing, so when played back, the song sounds exactly as when it was
recorded.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-033#53:1>
Linked to the system are five programs which imitate the different
notes made by musical instruments, voices, noises and sounds of nature.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-033#54:1>
The system lets him play all the instruments on a score by himself
which gives him more control, said Mr Yan.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-033#55:1>
" I don't have to worry that a musician doesn't play the way I want.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-033#56:1>
I can be both composer and musician".

<ICE-SIN:W2B-033#57:1>
There are 128 musicians in a Chinese classical orchestra.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-033#58:1>
Through the keyboard synthesiser, Mr Yan plays the score of each
instrument, assigning each score a track.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-033#59:1>
The computer can capture more than 120 tracks per composition, and
when they are played together, a symphony is born.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-033#60:1>
But the true beauty of the system, Mr Yan contends, lies in the ease
of editing a score.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-033#61:1>
With manual editing, the composer has to erase notes by hand.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-033#62:1>
And adding bars in the middle of a score is a composer's nightmare.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-033#63:1>
On the computer screen, that is all done at the click of a mouse.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-033#64:1>
He can transpose a score from key to key, or change its tempo,
volume, instrument and expression.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-033#65:1>
The entire system, with a mixer, speakers and tape deck, costs about
&dollar;16,000. 

<ICE-SIN:W2B-033#66:1>
<h> Brace yourself for digital future </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-033#67:1>
<h> The progress of multimedia has so far been mediocre at best, but
is it here to stay?

<ICE-SIN:W2B-033#68:1>
Yes, says IBM's multimedia expert Lucie Fjeldstad <h>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-033#69:1>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-033#70:1>
The song " Unforgettable" was a piece of technological wizardry.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-033#71:1>
Natalie Cole sang the song with her crooner father, the late Nat King
Cole in the song and the video.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-033#72:1>
Digital technology made this possible.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-033#73:1>
Nat King Cole's original recording was electronically joined with
Natalie Cole's version.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-033#74:1>
The result: a haunting duet which when shown during last year's
Grammy awards presentation touched the hearts of millions of viewers
throughout the world.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-033#75:1>
" We are in the digital world.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-033#76:1>
What was once impossible is now possible.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-033#77:1>
You cannot imagine what is 'do-able' today," said Mrs Lucie J
Fjeldstad, IBM Vice-President and General Manager, Multimedia Application
Solutions.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-033#78:1>
Mrs Fjeldstad is responsible for the company's global strategy in
multimedia and high performance computing.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-033#79:1>
She was here in early March on a business visit.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-033#80:1>
Mrs Fjeldstad defines multimedia as the " marriage of the
entertainment capabilities of television with the programming possibilities
of the personal computer".

<ICE-SIN:W2B-033#81:1>
" And what it does is it energises the senses - sight, sound, touch,
and one of these days, smell," she said.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-033#82:1>
But its progress has been mediocre at best.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-033#83:1>
To this, Mrs Fjeldstad emphatically argues that multimedia is already
invading our lives.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-033#84:1>
That one cannot feel and touch them, does not mean that multimedia
applications are not available.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-033#85:1>
In the United States, she says, IBM has been working with several
customers who want multimedia to " augment their business, by making
information available to them ( their customers) on a 24-hour basis".

<ICE-SIN:W2B-033#86:1>
The challenge was to " bring information to people through touch,
sight and hearing, because that's the way people think".

<ICE-SIN:W2B-033#87:1>
One application was an information kiosk in California that, among
other things, helps a driver renew his or her driving licence and find out
what jobs are available.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-033#88:1>
The ATM-like machine comprises a computer and a touch-screen that
allows you to instruct the computer with your fingers instead of using the
conventional keyboard.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-033#89:1>
Future information kiosks can do more things, predicts Mrs Fjeldstad,
including dispensing marriage and driver's licenses, stamps and air and
railway tickets, providing weather information and allowing the people to pay
government bills.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-033#90:1>
Since the key word is convenience, new businesses have sprung up
using multimedia to offer their services.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-033#91:1>
Mrs Fjeldstad recounts the case of a specialty carpet store in the US
that was able to do away with its costly warehouses-cum-showrooms after
installing several information kiosks in its 40-odd branches.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-033#92:1>
Users respond to several questions that appear on the touch screen of
the information kiosk to decide the type, colour, pattern and cost of the
flooring they want.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-033#93:1>
" You push with your finger and go through everything they have and
you look at it as if you are looking at your own room.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-033#94:1>
After you decide what you want, you push a button to tell them how
much you want and the computer will respond with the price.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-033#95:1>
You put in your credit card and they give you a date when it would be
delivered".

<ICE-SIN:W2B-033#96:1>
The key point of multimedia is its interactiveness and connectivity
which allows people located in different areas to come together to do
something.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-033#97:1>
" If I went to the doctor to have a cat scan and the result shows a
spot ( on my body) and he doesn't know what it is but he knows a specialist
in the next city who could tell me.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-033#98:1>
He calls the expert and electronically sends him the scan.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-033#99:1>
The specialist calls up the scan.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-033#100:1>
So all three of us are looking at the scan simultaneously and then
the specialist gives me an opinion".

<ICE-SIN:W2B-033#101:1>
When this finally happens - and it is not too far away, Mrs
Fjeldstad feels the whole medical industry will dramatically change".

<ICE-SIN:W2B-033#102:1>
Working at home, too, can be enhanced through a process Mr Fjeldstad
calls collaborative work.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-033#103:1>
IBM has a customer who is a soft drink bottler in Atlanta, US.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-033#104:1>
The customer wants to create an advertisement which will also be
used in Singapore.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-033#105:1>
" If the US guy and his Singapore counterpart can create the
advertisement together, that is, they are on-line to each other and they each
can see the same image on their computer screens, they can work faster and be
more productive".

<ICE-SIN:W2B-033#106:1>
Work habits will then be dramatically changed.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-033#107:1>
Because of the time difference between Singapore and the US, one
person will be working from home.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-033#108:1>
When this happens, multimedia will begin to appear in homes, said
Mrs Fjeldstad.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-033#109:1>
As an extension to this idea, she said it could be possible for a
departmental store to start direct marketing on a computer.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-033#110:1>
She would for example, be able to buy clothes without having to go
to the store herself.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-033#111:1>
She can specify to the computer the types of clothes she normally
would buy.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-033#112:1>
And the computer would pop these up for her to see on a regular
basis.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-033#113:1>
She would be able to select them and have a hologram of herself "
try" the clothes out for her to see.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-033#114:1>
If she wants to buy it, she would key in her credit card number and
the clothes would be delivered to her doorstep.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-033#115:1>
For all these applications Mrs Fjeldstad talked about, there must be
fast electronic highways capable of carrying gigabits of information quickly
so that data can be ferried from point to point without any loss of time. <X>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-033#X116:1>
High capacity data networks capable of carrying 45MB of data per
second has been installed in an American research and development network
called NSFNet. </X> </I>
