<h> Asian countries 'showing more boldness at forums' </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2C-011#3:1>
By Chiang Yin Pheng

<ICE-SIN:W2C-011#4:1>
ASIAN nations are now " talking back" to the West and expressing their
world views with greater confidence at international forums, said Professor
Chan Heng Chee yesterday.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-011#5:1>
Their newly-felt presence at conferences, such as the current one on
human rights in Vienna springs from the confidence of having robust
economies.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-011#6:1>
" Going with the economic power is that sense of Asian pride that has
Asian countries telling Western ones: 'Look, I am going to have a dialogue
with you, " she said.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-011#7:1>
World forums are therefore seeing more evenly-matched debates between
Western and Third World nations, said the head of the Singapore International
Foundation and the Institute of Southeast Asian Studies.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-011#8:1>
She made these observations while fielding questions from students at
the Pre-University Seminar, held at the National University of Singapore.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-011#9:1>
Asked whether the economic power and influence of Asia would
overshadow that of the Western powers, she said that the issue had to he seen
in perspective.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-011#10:1>
While Western nations were in a general state of recession, they were
certainly " not in a state of rot".

<ICE-SIN:W2C-011#11:1>
Germany, for example, was expected to bounce back from its
unification problems in five years or so; and although America was in a
slump, its store of creativity, capital and energy would pull it through, she
said.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-011#12:1>
For now, however, Asian economies were picking up economic strength -
and the confidence to tell Western nations, at the human rights conference in
Vienna for example, that the rights to safe homes and good jobs were more
vital than the right to free elections.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-011#13:1>
In her speech earlier, she urged her young audience to look outwards
and deepen their knowledge of the region.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-011#14:1>
It was not enough for them to know the hard facts about these
countries, she said.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-011#15:1>
They should also know the " soft-ware" - the language and the
culture - to be able to function abroad.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-011#16:1>
During question time, 24 students raised issues, ranging from
business opportunities in Russia to the devaluation of the Chinese renminbi.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-011#17:1>
Several posed specific scenarios and asked how they could affect
Singapore's go-regional drive.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-011#18:1>
Such was the diversity of questions that Prof Chan remarked later: "
When I accepted the invitation to speak on 'Looking beyond Singapore', I
didn't think that I would be discussing every country under the sun." To a
question on the Cambodian election results, she said if order could reign,
Singapore and other businessmen would do well there.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-011#19:1>
But the country must wipe out corruption and build its
infrastructure.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-011#20:1>
What if the Chinese economy overheated, one student asked.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-011#21:1>
She said there could be a worst-case or best-case scenario but
stressed that China's long-term-prospects were good as its economy was big.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-011#22:1>
On whether Japan could become a world power on par with the United
States, she said that it would take time.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-011#23:1>
" Whether it should become a military power is still being debated
but I think it is hard for a country to assert its status if it is not a
military power.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-011#24:1>
" Japan was now trying to come up with a new concept of world power
that excluded the military dimension.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-011#25:1>
This was a kind of " soft " power, she said.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-011#26:1>
To questions on the media's role in pointing out where overseas
business opportunities were, she said that the best fallback was still the
investors' instincts to go where money could be made: " It is no use telling
them to go here or there.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-011#27:1>
Entrepreneurs - the good ones - know it even before analysts put the
figures down on charts".

<ICE-SIN:W2C-011#28:1>
Prof Chan made such an impact on the youngsters that at the end of
the session, they gave her a standing ovation.

EDB chief cites Michael Jackson concert as example

<ICE-SIN:W2C-011#32:1>
by Chiang Yin Pheng

<ICE-SIN:W2C-011#33:1>
THE go-regional drive has another dimension - in addition to taking
Singapore into the region, the region could be brought into Singapore.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-011#34:1>
For example, the Michael Jackson concert and the Les Miserables
musical were events which would draw in audiences and resources from outside
the country, said Economic Development Board's managing director Tan Chin Nam
yesterday.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-011#35:1>
With " borrowed resources" in the form of foreign talents being
watched by " borrowed audiences", Singapore would become a cultural and
entertainment hub for the region.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-011#36:1>
Speaking to 500 students attending the Pre-U Seminar at the National
University of Singapore campus, he gave an overview of how Singapore was
marshalling its resources for the " go regional" drive.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-011#37:1>
Referring to the forums and workshops being held and the various
national plans to entrench information technology, biotechnology and
automation, Mr Tan said that they were all part of the " total national
response" to the call.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-011#38:1>
To illustrate his points more vividly to the 17- and 18-year-olds,
he produced graphics, video clips set to pop music and a segment of a
Broadway musical.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-011#39:1>
He said that the Michael Jackson and Pavarotti concerts, as well as
the musicals Cats and Les Miserables, were steps in bringing a piece of the
world into Singapore.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-011#40:1>
For the Michael Jackson show, he noted that telephone calls for
tickets were coming from as far as Sri Lanka.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-011#41:1>
Such events, which bring regional audiences here, would generate
economic spin-offs for the hotels and strengthen the economy, he added.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-011#42:1>
As for Singapore going into the region, Mr Tan gave the example of
home-grown entrepreneur Ong Beng Seng.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-011#43:1>
As holder of the Asian franchise for the Hard Rock Cafe string of
restaurants, Mr Ong has opened outlets in Jakarta, Kuala Lumpur and Bangkok
and will do so in Bali, Taipei and Beijing soon.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-011#44:1>
In his hour-long speech he urged the students to think Singapore
Unlimited.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-011#45:1>
Singapore's small size meant it could be quick to respond to changes
in economic conditions.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-011#46:1>
And think of the world as a borderless one.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-011#47:1>
" In this new age, cities will compete, but they will also
collaborate, drawing on each other's strengths," he said, adding that wealth
was now measured in how productive a country could be, not how much resources
it had.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-011#48:1>
The EDB chief also noted that the public and private sectors still
had some way to go in pooling their efforts to build Singapore's external
economy.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-011#49:1>
Disclosing the findings of a Government survey on cooperation between
the private and public sectors, he said that four in l0 respondents thought
that current efforts were not enough.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-011#50:1>
But three quarters of the respondents agreed strongly that the two
sectors should work together to exploit economic openings outside Singapore.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-011#51:1>
The gap between reality and the ideal meant that more work still
remained to be done, he said.

<h> Youthful spirit prevails at 65th anniversary reunion of Raffles
College </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2C-011#53:1>
By Chua Mui Hoong

<ICE-SIN:W2C-011#54:1>
THEY came, some limping with canes in hand, some supported by spouses
and friends, nursing arthritic joints and ageing bodies.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-011#55:1>
But tongues wagged furiously to reveal their youthful spirits when
the 250 Raffles College alumni and their spouses got together last night for
their 65th anniversary celebration dinner at the Mandarin Hotel.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-011#56:1>
As Mrs Lily Padman, 65, said of her husband of 40 years, Stanley 74,
and his cronies from the batch of 1940: " When they met up, they behaved like
boys." Not surprisingly these " boys" - whose ages range from about 65 to 86
 - recalled the ragging that took place with chuckles.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-011#57:1>
Mr Padman said that he got off relatively mildly - he only had to
sing.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-011#58:1>
" Mr Lee Kuan Yew had to push a mothball with his forehead," he
recounted.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-011#59:1>
Senior Minister Lee and his wife, both Raffles College alumni, were
also at the dinner, as were former Cabinet ministers Howe Yoon Chong, Lim Kim
San and E.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-011#60:1>
W.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-011#61:1>
Barker, and from Malaysia, the Governor of Penang, Tun Dato Seri Dr
Hamdan Sheikh Tahir.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-011#62:1>
Mr Paul Chang, 74, said he was almost drowned in the bathtub every
day for a week.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-011#63:1>
But it was all good, clean fun, he added.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-011#64:1>
On a more serious note, he said reflectively: " I was 17 when I
entered Raffles College.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-011#65:1>
At the end of it, I was transformed from a raw, diffident timid boy
to a self-assured young man." He is the former chief inspector GE schools in
Malaysia.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-011#66:1>
These boys grew into confident men, many taking up illustrious
positions in government and commerce.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-011#67:1>
The college has produced at least two heads of government, three
heads of state, 11 Cabinet ministers, two attorney-generals, five judges,
and 23 high commissioners and ambassadors from among its 573 alumni produced
from 1928 to 1949.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-011#68:1>
After that, the college was reinstituted to become the University of
Malaya.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-011#69:1>
They came back for the three-day anniversary get-together beginning
on Friday, from as far away as Canada.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-011#70:1>
It was an historic occasion, and at least one man was aware of it.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-011#71:1>
" Look at this, the original college crest," said Mr M.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-011#72:1>
S.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-011#73:1>
Selvamamy, 67, pointing to his breast pocket where his wife had
painstakingly sewn the college crest cut from his old college blazer.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-011#74:1>
" It's a part of history, I can tell you.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-011#75:1>
I will donate it to the alumni office." Many remembered fondly the
close ties forged during their college days, when the student population was
small and camaraderie strong.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-011#76:1>
" It was like an extended family," said Mr Selvamamy mistily.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-011#77:1>
" There was no distinction in race, religion, class.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-011#78:1>
We knew everybody," he added, proving the truth of this by naming in
an undertone those who were walking into the hotel's Belvedere Room for a
seafood dinner.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-011#79:1>
Last night's fare of garoupa, prawn and lobster were a far cry from
college grub served in the post-war years when food was scarce and what there
was, was so badly cooked students reportedly threw eggs at the cook.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-011#80:1>
As Mr Siew Nim Wah, 66, said " The food was so bad when we wrote home
we used to say we were given yesterday's bread and tomorrow's bananas."
Yesterday's programme included a tour of the old Raffles College campus at
Bukit Timah, now the National Institute of Education.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-011#81:1>
Madam Tay Kheng Eng, 82, who was among the pioneer batch of 43
enrolled in 1928, liked the way the modern additions blended in with the
colonial-style buildings.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-011#82:1>
But Mr Khoo Seang Hoe 70, did not.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-011#83:1>
" They have murdered our dormitories," he grumbled.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-011#84:1>
Last night, the men came dressed in dark batik shirts or coat and
tie, the women wearing pearls and cheongsams.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-011#85:1>
Murmurs of " you look the same", alternated with puzzled stares and
embarrassed laughs as old classmates failed to recognise each other after not
meeting for over half a century. As old boy and now university pro-chancellor
Maurice Baker put it: " Some have turned into blondes and some have lost
their hair altogether, but this is a good way to crown the anniversary
celebrations." </I>

THE STRAITS TIMES SATURDAY JUNE 26, 1993

<ICE-SIN:W2C-011#87:2>
<h> Pre-U Seminar </h> <h> Passion, not profits alone, drives the
entrepreneur, say bosses </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2C-011#88:2>
By Chiang Yin Pheng

<ICE-SIN:W2C-011#89:2>
A MAGNIFICENT obsession - not just the search for profits - is what
makes an entrepreneur.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-011#90:2>
He takes risks in a field he is passionate about and picks himself up
when he fails.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-011#91:2>
This composite sketch of the entrepreneur emerged yesterday when four
corporate chieftains shared their insights with students on the last day of
the Pre-U seminar on the theme " Growing the Second Wing: Our External
Economy".

<ICE-SIN:W2C-011#92:2>
They were Wuthelam's executive chairman Koh Boon Hwee, Heshe
Holdings' managing director Chia Shi Teck, Scotts Holdings' managing director
Rafiq Jumabhoy and Wah-Chang International's president Ho Kwon Ping.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-011#93:2>
Mr Koh and Mr Chia saw entrepreneurs as more than just businessmen
out to make money.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-011#94:2>
Mr Koh said an entrepreneur had to start a business which provided
jobs and had growth potential, and which was a fresh, value-added idea.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-011#95:2>
" Mr Ho Kwon Ping is an entrepreneur.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-011#96:2>
He brought Wah-Chang into the holiday resort business.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-011#97:2>
Of course, the company's acquisition of many more resorts don't count
as entrepreneurial moves anymore.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-011#98:2>
Those are business expansions," said Mr Koh, to laughter from his
fellow panelists and the audience Mr Ho, however, argued that entrepreneurs
often did not start out knowing the growth potential of their ventures. <X>

<ICE-SIN:W2C-011#X99:2>
This was because their businesses were extensions of their "
magnificent obsessions", activities which they enjoyed for their own sake.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-011#X100:2>
People did not " decide" to become entrepreneurs or receive
training for it, he said, citing Steve Job and Bill Gates of the computer
industry and fashion designer Liz Claiborne as those whose businesses grew
out of their passions.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-011#X101:2>
To the 500 seminar participants, he added: " Your thought process
should be 'Is there anything in life I want to pursue' rather than 'How do I
become an entrepreneur?' " The panelists agreed that the Government could,
however, nurture entrepreneurial qualities through an education system which
rewarded creativity, not mere technical competence.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-011#X102:2>
Mr Jumabhoy noted that the spirit of entrepreneurship often came
out when individuals were driven to carve out niches for themselves, or to
prove that they could succeed.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-011#X103:2>
They were people who believed in their chances for success,
mobilised their resources to grab opportunities and who were in touch with
what their customers wanted.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-011#X104:2>
" The entrepreneur should not take on the image of a glorified
Tarzan, steering his company from the top," he said.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-011#X105:2>
All agreed that entrepreneurship had a risk element and on the need
to accept failure and move on.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-011#X106:2>
Mr Koh revealed how a million-dollar joint venture he started with
a friend became a
&dollar;1.4-million loss in six months.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-011#X107:2>
" But we persevered and turned the business around.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-011#X108:2>
It's doing well now," he said, declining to say what it was.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-011#X109:2>
The panelists also agreed that Government incentives were not the
crucial factor in deciding whether an individual took the plunge into
business here or abroad.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-011#X110:2>
Perks were only the frosting on the cake, said Mr Koh, agreeing
with Mr Chia that Singaporeans had been going abroad to do business for a
long time - without Government support.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-011#X111:2>
Perhaps the entrepreneur has been scrutinised too closely,
suggested Mr Ho:

<ICE-SIN:W2C-011#X112:2>
" All this talk about entrepreneurs is making those who are
supposed to be entrepreneurs feel a little like panda bears: Not only are we
supposed to be an endangered species, with so many people watching, we can't
actually reproduce in public." </X> </I>
