<h> It's Job Week, so give us work, not money: Scouts </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2C-010#3:1>
WHEN Paul Cheak went knocking on doors last year during the Boy
Scouts' annual Job Week, half the households he approached gave him money
without asking him to do any work.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-010#4:1>
A scout's dream come true?

<ICE-SIN:W2C-010#5:1>
Hardly.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-010#6:1>
Paul and his friends would rather work for their money .

<ICE-SIN:W2C-010#7:1>
But many Singaporeans with busy schedules and hired help have no time
to supervise the scouts who come knocking on their doors.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-010#8:1>
Others say they cannot find odd jobs at a moment's notice.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-010#9:1>
That is not good news to the scouts.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-010#10:1>
Said Chua I-Min, 17: " It's more meaningful for us to work - it's
called Job Week, not Donation Week." I-Min, Paul and eight other scouts spent
yesterday morning at the Istana, sweeping, polishing and cleaning to launch
Job Week.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-010#11:1>
From today till Sunday, ll,000 scouts carrying pledge cards will ring
door-bells and look for work.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-010#12:1>
Last year, they raised
&dollar;280,000. 

<ICE-SIN:W2C-010#13:1>
This year, their target is
&dollar;350,000. 

<ICE-SIN:W2C-010#14:1>
Mr Peter Joe Chia, Financial Resources Commissioner of the
Singapore Scout Association, said: " I know people are busy, but they can
still get the boys to do jobs like sweeping the floor.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-010#15:1>
" The point is to teach them that honest work is worth emulating and
that there is honour in labour - yes, money is important, but that's not the
be-all and end-all of the job." Some people mean well when they send the
scouts away with a few dollars.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-010#16:1>
Said Ms Wee Lee Fung, an accountant in her 30s: " I already have a
maid who does the housework, so I just give the scouts a bit of money.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-010#17:1>
This way they won't feel discouraged."

<ICE-SIN:W2C-010#18:1>
Some people feel the scouts cannot do a thorough enough job without
supervision - and to sit and direct them would be too inconvenient.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-010#19:1>
Several companies feel that theirs would be the wrong place to do odd
jobs - factories, for example, could be dangerous, while others say their
staff do everything.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-010#20:1>
For example, Ms Dinger Leong, assistant manager of advertising and
public relations at the Holiday Inn Parkview, said that there are no jobs
available for such a short time frame.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-010#21:1>
Even jobs such as cleaning are done on a set schedule and are handled
by trained staff.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-010#22:1>
However, Mr Albert Toh, general manager of the Hard Rock Cafe, feels
that work can always be found.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-010#23:1>
The boys he said, could do odd jobs such as mending and cleaning
furniture, with some staff supervision.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-010#24:1>
He would then get his staff to pitch in and pay the scouts.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-010#25:1>
Money is not all that the boys get - they also do work they would not
do otherwise and learn to negotiate and deal with rejection.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-010#26:1>
Paul, for instance, has worked as a baby-sitter, cleaned tennis
courts and polished cars.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-010#27:1>
At home, his housework is confined to washing dishes.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-010#28:1>
Persuasive skills are also honed.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-010#29:1>
Said I - Min: " Sometimes, people get quite hostile - but you just keep
calm and explain your purpose." Some have picked up a tip or two on where to
get work.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-010#30:1>
Zhuang Tian Wei, 18, for instance, knows that jobs come easier at
housing estates rather than affluent neighbourhoods with landed property - -
the latter are more likely to have maids, he explained.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-010#31:1>
President Wee Kim Wee, who offered cakes and drinks to the 10 scouts
who spent the morning sprucing up the Istana, said: " It helps for the boys
to know they can raise money with their own hands." </I>

<h> S'pore to hold first major art fair in September </h> <h>
Original works by Picasso and Salvador Dali to be featured </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2C-010#33:2>
By Geraldine Kan

<ICE-SIN:W2C-010#34:2>
SINGAPORE'S first major art fair, to be held in September, will
feature more than US&dollar;50 million ( S&dollar;80 million) worth of art for sale under
one roof - including original works by Pablo Picasso, Marc Chagall, Salvador
Dali and David Hockney.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-010#35:2>
Called Tresors 1993, the exhibition, to be held at the World Trade
Centre from Sept 29 to Oct 3, will be the first on such a large scale in the
region.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-010#36:2>
It will bring together 100 of the world's leading dealers from
Europe, North America and Asia.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-010#37:2>
Mr William Burris, president of Bradbury Ltd, the UK-based company
managing the fair, said: " Tresors' ambition is to establish the Singapore
fair as one of the five great international ones within five years so that
the top fine art and antique dealers and galleries will have a major fair in
the largest potential market in the world." The event, which will be open to
the public, targets buyers from Hongkong, Taiwan and Malaysia as well as
other countries in the region.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-010#38:2>
It will be an annual event for the next few years.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-010#39:2>
Apart from Singapore's location and the region's projected growth, Mr
Burris also cited government support for the arts as a reason the company
picked the Republic as the venue over other contenders like Seoul and
Hongkong.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-010#40:2>
He said he sees Singapore as the ideal place for Tresors because of
its potential, despite its fledgling art scene.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-010#41:2>
" You can only put so much water in a glass.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-010#42:2>
In a country like Hongkong, the glass is full.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-010#43:2>
But in Singapore and South-east Asia, no one knows how big the glass
is or how much water there is in it."

<ICE-SIN:W2C-010#44:2>
He said although European and American art dealers had been eyeing
Asian buyers, they had only been using Hongkong and Japan as a base.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-010#45:2>
The fair, he said, will be a way for dealers to reach buyers in this
region.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-010#46:2>
Said Mr Yeo Seng Teck, the chief executive officer of the Trade
Development Board ( TDB) and chairman of the Empress Place Museum:

<ICE-SIN:W2C-010#47:2>
" It will give a boost to the Singapore arts scene - both artists and
the public will be exposed to some of the best works in the world.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-010#48:2>
" The Government regards this fair as an important pioneering event
in our efforts to promote Singapore as an international arts centre, not only
for the development of arts and culture, but also as an important new
economic activity."

<ICE-SIN:W2C-010#49:2>
At a briefing yesterday, dealers from cities including New York,
Paris and Zurich previewed about a dozen pieces that will be shown at the
exhibition.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-010#50:2>
These include Picasso's Bearded Man, Chagall's Clown on a White Horse
and Hockney's Seascape.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-010#51:2>
The event is supported by the TDB, Empress Place Museum and the
Economic Development Board, which is helping with the logistics.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-010#52:2>
Ms Sarina Tang, an art consultant with Sarina Tang Fine Arts in New
York, said she is attending the exhibition because the region is on the verge
of putting much more emphasis on the arts and also because of Singapore's
link to the East and West.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-010#53:2>
" Once countries achieve a certain amount of economic success, they
turn to finer things," said Ms Tang, who brought in Hockney's Seascape, which
is worth about US&dollar;225,000.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-010#54:2>
In September, she will bring in works by artists such as Jackson
Pollock, Fernando Botero and Willem de Kooning.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-010#55:2>
A
&dollar;10,000 PRIZE for the best original local artwork is being offered in
conjunctlon wlth the art exhibition Tresors.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-010#56:2>
The multi-media competition, which is open to all professional
artists living in Singapore, is divided into two groups: painting and three
dimensional art.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-010#57:2>
The two top works in each category of the Philip Morris Group of
Companies Singapore Art Awards 1993 will be shown at the Roy Miles Gallery in
London.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-010#58:2>
The panel of local and foreign judges include Mr Ng Eng Teng, Thomas
Yeo, both local artists, as well as Mr Roy Miles, owner of the London gallery
in which the winning entries will be put on display.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-010#59:2>
The top five entries in the painting category and the top three in
three-dimensional art will receive cash awards amounting to
&dollar;43,000. 

<ICE-SIN:W2C-010#60:2>
All winning entries will also be exhibited at the Philip
Morris Group of Companies Pavilion at Tresors. </I>

<h> More singles over 35 seeking help from matchmaking agencies </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2C-010#62:3>
But people are urged to be realistic about their future Spouses

<ICE-SIN:W2C-010#63:3>
By Geraldine Kan

<ICE-SIN:W2C-010#64:3>
MORE men and women over 35 years old are turning to matchmaking
agencies to help find a partner, but traditional expectations of spouses are
still hampering a successful match.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-010#65:3>
Matchmakers say women still prefer men their age or slightly older.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-010#66:3>
The men must also match their educational and financial status.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-010#67:3>
Men are less fussy about a woman's status, but they are still choosy
about her looks and age.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-010#68:3>
Dates have to be about five years younger.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-010#69:3>
Matchmaking agencies have had to resort to counselling to persuade
both men and women to be more realistic - and even to advertising for older
men.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-010#70:3>
The government matchmakers, the Social Development Unit ( SDU) and
Social Development Section ( SDS), have reported a near-doubling in the
number of singles over 35 joining them since 1990.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-010#71:3>
At the same time, private matchmaking agencies have reported a
one-third increase in the number of singles registered with them.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-010#72:3>
On Sunday, Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong said that the proportion of
unmarried women above 35 years old had increased between 1980 and 1990.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-010#73:3>
If not corrected, he said the trend would weaken family building
blocks.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-010#74:3>
He also said that there was a growing number of single men.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-010#75:3>
But while most single women had secondary and post-secondary
qualifications, single men mostly did not have secondary school education.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-010#76:3>
The SDU and SDS have also seen the number of older members rise
faster than those of other age groups.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-010#77:3>
" Both sides are looking for spouses, but perhaps they are
concentrating on careers first," said Dr Ang Wai Hoong, SDU's director.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-010#78:3>
Mrs Jean Lim, head of SDS, said that it has several activities every
month, ranging from talks to outdoor trips, open only to those over 30.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-010#79:3>
She added that there are more marriages every year since 1990,
although there are no figures on the rates between the different age groups.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-010#80:3>
Some private agencies have even resorted to advertising for potential
mates to meet their clients' needs.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-010#81:3>
Mr Horatio Lee, manager of the 1-year-old Goodluck Friends Centre,
targets car owners, leaving brochures under their windscreen wipers to draw
affluent, older single men to meet the demands of older single women.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-010#82:3>
The matchmakers' persuasive powers - getting clients to lower their
expectations - are also being tested.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-010#83:3>
Mrs K.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-010#84:3>
Saroja, a consultant with Introducer, said that some of her male
clients are becoming status conscious when looking for a spouse, though men
in general are not as concerned about status as women.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-010#85:3>
She also noted that grooming and manners have become more important
to both sexes, as well as how partners spend their free time.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-010#86:3>
Generally, they prefer someone who likes outdoor activities such as
racquet games and cycling, or who share their own leisure activities.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-010#87:3>
Ms Angela Raju of matchmaking agency Icebreakers said: " I foresee my
job becoming more and more difficult.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-010#88:3>
If neither side wants to change their thinking, it will be harder for
us to find someone for them." </I>

<h> Win Olympic medal, PM challenges sailors </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2C-010#90:4>
By Tay Cheng Khoon

<ICE-SIN:W2C-010#91:4>
Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong has thrown a challenge to Singapore's
yachting fraternity:

<ICE-SIN:W2C-010#92:4>
Win a medal at the 2008 Olympic Games.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-010#93:4>
Speaking at the official opening of the National Sailing Centre at
the East Coast Parkway yesterday, he said that Singapore's sportsmen should
aim not only for regional recognition, but also strive to be world beaters.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-010#94:4>
" I therefore want to throw out a challenge to you.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-010#95:4>
Win an Olympic medal for Singapore at the 2008 Games. '

<ICE-SIN:W2C-010#96:4>
" This is an ambitious goal, he admitted, but one within reach."

<ICE-SIN:W2C-010#97:4>
Then, to the applause of the 400-strong audience, he added:

<ICE-SIN:W2C-010#98:4>
" You can be the little giant who succeeds in an Olympian task."

<ICE-SIN:W2C-010#99:4>
He then praised the Republic's sailors who, in recent years, have
performed well in various regional and international competitions.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-010#100:4>
" More importantly, their discipline, commitment and spirit of
sacrifice have been exemplary.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-010#101:4>
" You need more athletes like them to keep the Singapore flag flying
high in international competitions."

<ICE-SIN:W2C-010#102:4>
Such successes, he said, help nation-building.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-010#103:4>
Sports can entertain,excite, bond the people and bind a nation. <X>

<ICE-SIN:W2C-010#X104:4>
Earlier on, he disclosed that the Singapore Sports Council is keen
on making sailing as popular as swimming.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-010#X105:4>
This, he said, makes a lot of sense.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-010#X106:4>
" We are an island-state surrounded by the sea.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-010#X107:4>
Sailing is a sport that all Singaporeans can enjoy."

<ICE-SIN:W2C-010#X108:4>
" It helps develop self-discipline and mental and physical
stamina."

<ICE-SIN:W2C-010#X109:4>
" It brings us closer to the great outdoors and helps us to better
appreciate our environment."

<ICE-SIN:W2C-010#X110:4>
He would encourage more schools, community centres and clubs to
include sailing in their activities.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-010#X111:4>
Mr Goh, a keen golfer and tennis player, later told The Sunday
Times that he " never had a chance" to try sailing, although he lived near
the sea when he was young.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-010#X112:4>
It was just swimming and " rowing the sampans."

<ICE-SIN:W2C-010#X113:4>
The 2.4-hectare National Sailing Centre costs
&dollar;8 million.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-010#X114:4>
It caters for all classes of sailors - from schoolchildren to
adults and national team members. The Straits Times, June 27 1999. </X> </I>
