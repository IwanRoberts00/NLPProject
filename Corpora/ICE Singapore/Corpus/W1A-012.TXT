Q1 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-012#2:1>
Modern day psychology has
been dominated by empirical research at the expense of conceptual
investigation. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-012#3:1>
Psychology, especially clinical
psychology, is characterised by research for empirical data.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-012#4:1>
It will be argued that empirical concerns and
conceptual issues play equally important roles in the psychological
explanation of human behaviour. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-012#5:1>
A psychological
investigation using empirical research is concerned with studying actual
cases of phenomenon. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-012#6:1>
It is in this yield that
psychologists observed real cases of human behaviour or mental states and
then, proceed by making generalizations about the regularities observed.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-012#7:1>
However, Ryau claims that when researchers fail to
obtain results in their studies, they tend to examine the conceptual issues
involved. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-012#8:1>
In a qualified sense, all empirical research
is dependent upon conceptual clarification. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-012#9:1>
Before
empirical research can be conducted, the researchers have to conceptualize
the problem they intend to study. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-012#10:1>
Without meticulous
conceptualization, one may not even know what one is looking for in the
empirical study. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-012#11:1>
Hence, conceptualization takes place
first. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-012#12:1>
This is where the researchers define the
problem, state what exactly they are looking for and determine the criteria
by which they use words. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-012#13:1>
Having done
conceptualization, the researchers can then go on to operationalize these
concepts and use them for the empirical study. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-012#14:1>

Conceptual issues in psychology serve to set the logical limits of
possibility or impossibility. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-012#15:1>
Empirical concerns look
within these limits to observe regularities which may then be generalized.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-012#16:1>
Conceptual questions are not factual questions; they
are second-order questions about a discipline. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-012#17:1>

Conceptual questions ask " How is this possible?" 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-012#18:1>

Empirical questions ask " How does this happen?" 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-012#19:1>

Conceptual clarification may lead to conceptual illumination.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-012#20:1>
Examining concepts within psychology and the criteria
by which we use terms and concepts may result in a radical new way we look at
old problems. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-012#21:1>
it has been claimed that scientific
progress was possible only because of the solving of many conceptual puzzles.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-012#22:1>
Physics and other natural sciences have advanced
greatly because of the concomitant advances made in the conceptual
clarification of their respective fields. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-012#23:1>
However, the
concepts of psychology have not advanced as much as those in the natural
sciences. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-012#24:1>
Hence, philosophers, who are trained to
think at a level of abstractness not required in empirical psychology, feel
that they can make an important contribution to the field of psychology.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-012#25:1>
The result of philosophical investigation and inquiry
into the conceptual issues of psychology may be extremely fruitful.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-012#26:1>
Gilbert Ryle has claimed that there is no need for
empirical research in studying human behaviour. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-012#27:1>
All we
need to do is to do philosophical investigation. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-012#28:1>
This
however, is quite a radical view. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-012#29:1>
I would like to
argue that just as psychology would be impoverished by lack of concern for
conceptual issues, it would be equally impoverished by lack of empirical
data. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-012#30:1>
What then, is the role of empirical data?

<ICE-SIN:W1A-012#31:1>
Some researchers start their research by empirical
observation. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-012#32:1>
Having observed regularities in the
phenomena, they generalise the regularities and then, generate theories.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-012#33:1>
This form of research can be fruitful because it may
bring to light previously unknown regularities. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-012#34:1>
The
generation of theory is based on empirical concerns. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-012#35:1>

However, even if research is based on priori conceptualization, empirical
concerns do play a major role. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-012#36:1>
Having clarified
concepts and set logical possibilities and impossibilities, researchers can
use empirical data to verify their theories or hypotheses.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-012#37:1>
Empirical data can prove or disprove hypotheses.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-012#38:1>
A philosopher acquainted with empirical data from
psychology would be able to develop a richer and more substantive
understanding of the issues involved. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-012#39:1>
One could say
that empirical concerns and conceptual issues can have mutual interaction.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-012#40:1>
A combination of both empirical concerns of conceptual
issues would result in a more substantive and comprehensive psychology.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-012#41:1>
Conceptual issues or empirical concerns alone may be
able to explain only limited domains. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-012#42:1>
However, a
combination and interaction of both results in greater progress.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-012#43:1>
Conceptual issues may tell us what to look for and
what is possible or not. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-012#44:1>
Empirical concerns would then
verify or disprove conceptual hypotheses. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-012#45:1>
This would
force one to reexamine the conceptual issues and so on.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-012#46:1>
In this manner, the interaction between empirical
concerns and conceptual issues is a dynamic one which may result in a richer
psychology. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-012#47:1>
The explanatory powers of conceptual
issues and empirical concerns on their own is limited. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-012#48:1>

A synthesis of both would be more enriched. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-012#49:1>
In the
field of psychology, it is not the case of " old wine in new bottles", as has
been claimed by Ned Block. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-012#50:1>
Perhaps this is most
evident in the study of emotions. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-012#51:1>
In the study of
emotions, conceptual issues and empirical concerns can be used to develop
greater understanding. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-012#52:1>
BY its own nature, the study of
emotions lends itself to the mutual interaction between the conceptual and
the empirical. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-012#53:1>
This is because physiology and
cognition etc. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-012#54:1>
can be studied either conceptually or
empirically; even both. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-012#55:1>
Perhaps with greater
interaction between conceptual issues and empirical concerns, we may be able
to see the discipline of psychology making greater progress.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-012#56:1>
Psychological studies are such that they are so
closely related to the " heartland" of folk psychology and issues of the mind
studied by philosophers. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-012#57:1>
Psychology and philosophy are
intimately related; the issues examined are relatively similar.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-012#58:1>
Hence, there should not be a bias towards either
conceptual or empirical research, a combination of both would be more
enriching. </I>

<ICE-SIN:W1A-012#59:2>
Q2 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-012#60:2>
Lyons' cognitive theory
of emotions comprise the cognitive, evaluative and appetitive aspects.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-012#61:2>
Generally, a cognitive theory is one which makes some
aspect of thought, usually a belief, central to emotions.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-012#62:2>
According to Lyons, cognitions or judgement are first
made before we undergo an emotion. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-012#63:2>
Cognition is
therefore, a judgement or belief about something or some property of the
object of thought. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-012#64:2>
Lyons points out that even a false
belief or judgement may give rise to an emotion. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-012#65:2>
For
example, I may have stepped into a room and felt fear when I saw a coil of
rope because I had mistakenly believed that the coil of rope was a huge
snake. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-012#66:2>
Besides, cognition may not even be beliefs or
judgements about unique properties of the object of thought.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-012#67:2>
However, Lyons claims that cognition alone does not
give rise to emotions, we need the evaluative aspect. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-012#68:2>

Seeing a bomb in the room does not make me afraid. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-012#69:2>

What makes me afraid is my evaluation that the bomb is harmful and could
possibly kill me. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-012#70:2>
Lyons asserted that physiological
changes cannot differentiate between emotions. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-012#71:2>
By a
process of elimination, he endorses the view that it is the evaluative aspect
that distinguishes one emotion from another. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-012#72:2>
Having
eliminated physiology, Lyons claims that cognition does not fit the bill
either. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-012#73:2>
The reason being that different cognitions may
give rise to the same emotion and different emotions can be generated by the
same cognition. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-012#74:2>
Furthermore, the appetitive apect of
emotions is derivative from the evaluative aspect. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-012#75:2>

Hence, I desire or want something because I evaluate the situation og having
that something as good. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-012#76:2>
Lyons concludes then, that we
are left with the evaluative aspect to distinguish between emotions.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-012#77:2>
According to Lyons, the evaluative aspect may take the
form of either an objective evaluation or a subjective appraisal.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-012#78:2>
Lyons also claimed that although some emotions may
have no appetitive aspect, in some cases we may have to appeal to the
appetitive aspect to distinguish between emotions. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-012#79:2>

Hence, Lyons' main thesis is that the cognitive theory of emotions, which
include the cognitive, evaluative and appetitive aspects, provides a coherent
account of emotions in general. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-012#80:2>
Lyons' theory of
emotions can be criticised on several counts. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-012#81:2>
One of
the main criticisms is that the cognitive theory cannot explain " objectless"
emotions. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-012#82:2>
For example, when I step into a dark room, I
feel fear, but there is no object of fear. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-012#83:2>
I believe
that Lyons can explain this type of emotion. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-012#84:2>
Lyons
asserts that in this case, the object may not be properly formulated or
expressed. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-012#85:2>
I feel fear simply because I have a vague
sense of foreboding. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-012#86:2>
Hence, the object of my fear may
be the lack of knowledge that I possess about the situation or even the
situation itself. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-012#87:2>
Hence, in a certain sense, my fear
is directed towards an " object", however vague, unformulated or unexpressed.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-012#88:2>
The second criticism against Lyons is that he cannot
expalin pre-reflexive, instantaneous or Pavlovian emotions.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-012#89:2>
These emotions seem to occur without the evaluation
taking place. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-012#90:2>
Lyons' reply to this criticism would be
that occurent emotions do not stand in need of occurent evaluations.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-012#91:2>
In the context of emotions, evaluations can be given a
dispositional analysis. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-012#92:2>
The first time I undergo an
emotion, I make the evaluation that is required. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-012#93:2>
As I
continue to undergo the same emotion, the same evaluation becomes reinforced.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-012#94:2>
Eventually, the evaluations once made, become
reinforced and then embedded. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-012#95:2>
This would result in my
having a tendency or disposition to act in a certain manner and undergo a
certain emotion when similar circumstances arise. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-012#96:2>
In
this sense, occurent emotions need not involve occurent evaluations.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-012#97:2>
The third criticism against Lyons' theory is that it
cannot explain emotions that are based on wishes and desires.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-012#98:2>
Lyons may be able to explain this.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-012#99:2>
He asserted that desires and wishes are derivative of
evaluations. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-012#100:2>
Hence, whatever I desire seems to be
dependent on how I evaluate it. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-012#101:2>
A critic may claim
that grief over the loss of a loved one occurs even though we know that the
dead cannot be brought back to life. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-012#102:2>
This is a case
of an emotion that arose of out conflicting beliefs; or rather, out of a
belief even though we know that the situation can not be attained.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-012#103:2>
In reply, Lyons can claim that the evaluation that I
wish the dead person was alive does not fully capture everything.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-012#104:2>
The reason why I desire or want/wish that the dead
person was not dead is because I evaluate the situation of the person' death
as a bad situation. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-012#105:2>
There is nothing irrational or
illogical about this. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-012#106:2>
Besides, wishing that the dead
person was alive does not entail doing anything to bring it about that the
person is alive. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-012#107:2>
The final criticism I would like to
examine is irrational emotions. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-012#108:2>
For example, someone
may fear lizards even though she believes that lizards are not harmful.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-012#109:2>
According to Picher, we cannot criticise this sort of
emotion as irrational. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-012#110:2>
Lyons' theory allow not only
for objective evaluation but for subjective apparaisals as well.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-012#111:2>
Pitcher claims that subjective emotions such as fear
or hate are basically a matter of taste. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-012#112:2>
We cannot
criticise this as being irrational because a subjective appraisal, being
subjective, is not subjected to norms and is traws or a-rational.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-012#113:2>
Hence, there is no question of irrationality here.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-012#114:2>
In conclusion, Lyons' cognitive theory of occurent
emotions seems quite comprehensive. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-012#115:2>
It is able to
answer the criticisms mentioned. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-012#116:2>
However, if the
theory were to be combined with a physiological theory, it would be more
powerful. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-012#117:2>
The cognitive-evaluative-appetitive
aspects of this theory captures the essence of the theory.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-012#118:2>
It is mainly the evaluative aspect and sometimes the
appetitive aspect that distinguishes one emotion from another. </I>

<ICE-SIN:W1A-012#119:3>
Q6 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-012#120:3>
( i)In his work A
Project for a Scientific Psychology, Freud endorses a view of type-type
identity between mental a physical states. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-012#121:3>
Later on,
Freud asserted that mental entities cannot be reduced to mere physical
entities. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-012#122:3>
Perhaps he was influenced by Brentano who
claimed that all mental entities were intentional entities.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-012#123:3>
Hence, Freud recognized that mental states cannot be
reduced to physical ones. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-012#124:3>
An eliminative
reductionist's stand is an incoherent one. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-012#125:3>
If we ask
an eliminationist whether he believed in reductionism, he cannot give an
answer. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-012#126:3>
If he says " Yes", then we can point out that
he still has to appeal to the notion of a belief. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-012#127:3>
If
he says " No", then we do not have to take him seriously.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-012#128:3>
It has been claimed that Freud held a neutral
position with regard to psycho-physical parralellism. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-012#129:3>

I believe that Freud had to be some sort of dualist; and believe in the
interaction between the mental and the physical. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-012#130:3>
If
Freud was not a dualist in some sense, how is it possible that mental states
can affect physical behaviour? </I>
