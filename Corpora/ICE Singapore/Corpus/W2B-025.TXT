<ICE-SIN:W2B-025#3:1>
The Silvered-leaf Monkey or Silvered Langur, Presbytis cristata (
Raffles), also known as Lotong Kelabu in Malay, is found in southern Myanmar,
Indo-China, Thailand, Peninsular Malaysia, south to Sumatra, Java and Borneo.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-025#4:1>
It frequents mangrove and freshwater swamp forests where its natural
diet consists of fruit, leaves and shoots of many plants, including that of
mangrove species.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-025#5:1>
The adult monkey is generally dull grey with pale silver tips to the
longer hairs.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-025#6:1>
The hands, feet, crown and tail are somewhat darker.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-025#7:1>
A distinctive feature, is the ragged crest of erect hairs on the top
of the head.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-025#8:1>
The monkeys can be divided into a few age groups.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-025#9:1>
The infants are covered with bright orange fur until 3-5 months old,
after which the fur gradually changes to a dull grey, starting with the fur
on the head, face, hands and feet.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-025#10:1>
The older infants thus have grey-coloured heads with pale orange
bodies.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-025#11:1>
The juveniles have the adult coloration but are smaller.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-025#12:1>
Adults are sexually mature and larger, a full grown male may reach
560 mm excluding the tail or 686 mm including the tail.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-025#13:1>
Adult females can be distinguished from males by their having
irregular patches of white on the inner portion of the upper thighs.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-025#14:1>
We had an opportunity to study the monkeys in June 1991 during a
field trip to Kuala Selangor Nature Park.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-025#15:1>
Bukit Melawati is a rocky outcrop rising 40 metres above the town of
Kuala Selangor and is the site of an ancient fortress.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-025#16:1>
It subtends the Kuala Selangor Nature Park to the west.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-025#17:1>
The organisation amongst primate societies may be complex and a
detailed analysis of the social organisation in the Silvered-leaf Monkeys of
Bukit Melawati could not be made due to our short period of study.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-025#18:1>
However, some interesting behaviour within and between troops were
observed, including food choice, social interaction, infant care, inter-troop
behaviour and interactions with man.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-025#19:1>
The Silvered-leaf Monkeys at Bukit Melawati Park are fairly tame,
ranging freely through their territories, including over available rooftops
and pylons.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-025#20:1>
They frequently come down to the ground to feed on food thrown to
them by visitors.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-025#21:1>
This behaviour is quite unlike that of their shy counterparts
inhabiting the nearby mangrove forests of Kuala Selangor Nature Park.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-025#22:1>
Their tameness allowed us to observe them at play, at rest, feeding
and interacting within and outside the troop.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-025#23:1>
The group we observed was a large one, comprising three troops, each
with about 30 members.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-025#24:1>
A researcher, Irwin Bernstein, studied these monkeys in the mid-60s.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-025#25:1>
Interestingly, judging from the troop movements and territories of
the troops we observed, these three troops could well be the same three
troops Bernstein had studied on Bukit Melawati, which he labelled as troops
M, W and E.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-025#26:1>
Though the borders of the territories of the three troops might have
shifted somewhat, they still corresponded roughly to those reported by
Bernstein.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-025#27:1>
If this is true, then we can compare the population sizes of the
three troops to their population thirty years ago.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-025#28:1>
In 1968, the troop size of M was 42-51, that of W was 26-31 and E
20-23.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-025#29:1>
In 1991, we have tentatively designated troops E, M and W as
corresponding to our troops 1, 2 and 3, which comprise 27, 20 and 26
individuals respectively.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-025#30:1>
It can be seen that the population sizes of troops 1 and 3 have
changed little while that of troop 2 has decreased.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-025#31:1>
Troops of monkeys have been reported to occupy territories of 20
hectares on average.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-025#32:1>
Each troop is led by a dominant male, known as the control male.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-025#33:1>
When two or more of the troops we were studying met, there were
frequent displays of territorial aggression towards one another.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-025#34:1>
This usually occurred on the boundaries of adjacent territories where
there were a few disputed trees.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-025#35:1>
A food patch set up to observe their feeding behaviour.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-025#36:1>
Peanuts are one of their favourite foods.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-025#37:1>
<h> Food choice and feeding behaviour </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-025#38:1>
We chose this disputed area to lay down our food patches to study the
feeding behaviour of the monkeys.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-025#39:1>
Altogether nine types of food were presented and the feeding choice
of the monkeys recorded.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-025#40:1>
The monkeys fed most frequently and readily on food items like
peanuts, banana and watermelon, but jackfruit and green apple were taken last
and in small quantities.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-025#41:1>
Raisin, dates, melon seeds and grasshoppers were avoided completely.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-025#42:1>
The monkey's choice of food may be partly a reflection of their
habituation to humans.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-025#43:1>
Peanuts and banana are often regarded by humans as standard 'monkey
food' and would be the food items most likely offered to the monkeys.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-025#44:1>
They would thus have learned to eat these foods.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-025#45:1>
Watermelon may be taken readily because it is relatively easy to
process, being soft and fleshy.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-025#46:1>
Jackfruit and apples are perhaps less 'familiar' food to the monkeys
and thus were taken less readily; or they may require more effort to eat.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-025#47:1>
The monkeys seemed to be deterred from eating apples by their
hardness - - one monkey was seen to spend more than three minutes eating an
apple, compared to the one minute spent on softer fruit like banana and
watermelon.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-025#48:1>
Eating jackfruit involved prying open the chambers to get at the
edible parts inside.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-025#49:1>
We also found that they ate the seeds of the jackfruit as well.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-025#50:1>
A troop of Silvered-leaf Monkeys amongst the branches of an Angsana
tree at Bukit Melawati Park.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-025#51:1>
Leaves remain the staple diet of the monkeys.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-025#52:1>
They choose the youngest leaves or leaf buds.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-025#53:1>
One reason why raisins and dates were avoided may be due to their
high sugar content.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-025#54:1>
Being herbivores the monkeys depend on microorganisms in the gut to
help digest the cellulose in their food.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-025#55:1>
It is possible that a high sugar diet may lead to the microorganisms
fermenting the excess sugar and eventually causing the animal to become ill.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-025#56:1>
If so, they may associate the sweet taste or the sight of such foods
with illness and thus avoid these foods.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-025#57:1>
On the other hand, it could be that they have not formed a search
image for these items, not having been offered any before.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-025#58:1>
Such might be the case for the melon seeds as well.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-025#59:1>
The grasshoppers with their hind-wings and legs removed, were not
noticed by the monkeys, who were more intent on the fruit.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-025#60:1>
The insects thus managed to crawl away from the food patch.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-025#61:1>
When the food had been eaten, the troops moved away from the food
patches and engaged in other activities like grooming, playing, etc.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-025#62:1>
In the later part of the afternoon, some disturbance was noticed
amongst members of troop 2 and vocalizations like low squeaks and squeals
were heard.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-025#63:1>
A few juveniles started running over the grass towards a stand of
large Angsana ( Pterocarpus indicus) trees, pausing now and then to call.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-025#64:1>
Eventually, one juvenile clambered up a tree, to be followed very
shortly by the whole troop.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-025#65:1>
The troop then proceeded to eat the leaves of the Angsana,
apparently, selecting the lighter-green, young leaves and leaf-buds.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-025#66:1>
<h> Intra-troop behaviour </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-025#67:1>
Before we laid down the food patches in the early afternoon, troops 1
and 3 were observed to be resting.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-025#68:1>
Members of the troops sat quietly in the trees, some scanning the
surroundings, grooming, or sleeping on their stomachs, with legs and tails
draped over the branches.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-025#69:1>
With the laying down of the food patches, a few adult males clambered
down almost immediately and started eating before we had finished laying out
the food.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-025#70:1>
Other members of the troop followed shortly but there were always a
few remaining in the trees.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-025#71:1>
Assertion of dominance was sometimes displayed at the food patches
that were set up.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-025#72:1>
One or two males were seen to monopolize the food patch, sometimes
preventing others from taking the food.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-025#73:1>
Some other adults stayed near the food and ate without being
disturbed.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-025#74:1>
Most older infants and juveniles snatched a handful of food and then
ran off somewhere, like up a tree and ate it slowly.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-025#75:1>
The dominance hierarchy seemed fairly established, since all-out
challenges involving pulling or slapping were not observed.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-025#76:1>
No threat displays were observed either.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-025#77:1>
Females with infants were allowed to feed freely at the food patches
and were seldom chased away.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-025#78:1>
A dominance hierarchy can be observed at the food patch where
dominant individuals get to feed first.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-025#79:1>
The greeting display of the monkeys was interesting.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-025#80:1>
One individual would walk up to another and sniff at its thigh.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-025#81:1>
Sniffing and hugging were observed frequently.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-025#82:1>
It has also been recorded that embracing of the flanks is performed
during periods of apparent distress.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-025#83:1>
At play, the monkeys pulled at each other's faces, executed light
punches, engaged in wrestling or chased each other up the trees.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-025#84:1>
Most play behaviour involved immature animals but animals of all ages
and both sexes sometimes participated.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-025#85:1>
Juveniles and infants were most active.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-025#86:1>
They were quite destructive to the surrounding vegetation.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-025#87:1>
One troop was observed to charge up an Allamanda shrub creating a
commotion and then scampering off leaving behind broken branches, fallen
leaves, flowers and stems.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-025#88:1>
Grooming usually involved two animals, and was most frequently
observed between females and infants.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-025#89:1>
One male was observed to move alone, often sitting by himself while
watching others at play, but never taking part in any of the activities.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-025#90:1>
He received some grooming from another adult male, but did not
reciprocate the action.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-025#91:1>
He was also observed to attempt to join another troop but was chased
away by the juveniles and adults of that group.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-025#92:1>
This suggests that the male may be left alone within his troop, but
is unwelcome in another, unlike the juveniles which were seen to move freely
from one troop to another.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-025#93:1>
In contrast to the juveniles, infants were rarely left alone.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-025#94:1>
There was nearly always an adult female within an arm's length away
that kept an eye on the infant as it moved around amongst the branches or on
the ground.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-025#95:1>
As soon as an alarm call was given by any member of the troop, the
adult female would pull the infant towards her and scramble off to safety
with the infant clinging to her chest.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-025#96:1>
It was also observed that an infant does not always stay with just
one adult female, but may be looked after by other adult females, juvenile
females and even adult males.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-025#97:1>
This is known as allomaternal behaviour.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-025#98:1>
One infant was transferred between five 'baby-sitters' during the two
hours it was followed, and it was seen to suckle from two of the females.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-025#99:1>
When danger approaches, or when the troop is on the move, the infant
is carried under its guardian's chest.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-025#100:1>
The transfer of an infant usually occurred when a female approached
the playing infant and its female baby-sitter and tried to pull the infant
towards her.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-025#101:1>
Usually the transfer took place smoothly without any aggression
between them.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-025#102:1>
However, such transfers can occasionally lead to a fight between the
two females with the loser backing off from the infant.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-025#103:1>
In the case of transfer of infants between males, it was usually the
infant which initiated the interaction and the males were the passive
participants.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-025#104:1>
Many theories have been suggested to explain this allomaternal
behaviour or infant transfer in primates, particularly in terms of the social
advantages to the females.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-025#105:1>
For instance, through the interactions with infants, females learn
parental care.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-025#106:1>
When the mother of an infant dies, the frequent interactions between
the infant and its baby-sitter may allow the infant to be adopted by another
female or even an older sibling.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-025#107:1>
Whilst troop 2 was feeding on the leaves of the Angsana tree, we
noticed a persistent squealing from one of the infants.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-025#108:1>
On closer inspection, we discovered that this individual did not
have a left hand.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-025#109:1>
The forelimb was broken off at the middle of the forearm.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-025#110:1>
Unlike other infants, this individual was not tended to despite its
squeals.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-025#111:1>
The adults continued to feed on the leaves and only after a few
minutes did one female drew this individual into her arms. <X>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-025#X112:1>
Infant transfer between two adults.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-025#X113:1>
Such allomaternal behaviour may benefit both infant and adult - -
the former gaining extra protection and care; the latter a lesson in looking
after young. </X> </I>
