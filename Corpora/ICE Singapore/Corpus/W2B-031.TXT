<h> Windows 3.1: Is it Worth Waiting for? </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-031#4:1>
Vicki Ching

<ICE-SIN:W2B-031#5:1>
Microsoft made a whirlwind in the world of personal computers when
they launched Windows 3.0.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-031#6:1>
It creates such an ingenious interface platform for advanced users, it
has spurred their imaginations wild in working towards that " perfect" system
environment of high efficiency and great power; with no crashing, no hanging,
and no UAE ( Unrecoverable Application Error).

<ICE-SIN:W2B-031#7:1>
Word Perfect for Windows, Harvard Graphics for Windows, Pagemaker for
Windows, Superbase 4 for Windows...nobody dares to doubt Microsoft Windows is
going to be the most recognised and widely used Graphical User Interface (
GUI) for the PC.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-031#8:1>
Though news of Windows 3.1's release may bring plenty of Windows
enthusiasts together for some hearty discussion, but your ranking of this
product over version 3.0 is really very much dependent upon the individual's
requirements, needs and computing environment.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-031#9:1>
I shall hereby provide a brief discussion on some of Windows 3.1's new
and enhanced features, as well as how far it stands with respect to its
predecessors.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-031#10:1>
Well then, let's just start right from the beginning with a simple
question: Have you scratched your head enough trying to verify the many
questions when you installed Windows 3.0; then Express setup is for you.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-031#11:1>
There is automatic detection of your hardware and configuration is
done to optimise performance.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-031#12:1>
Microsoft claims this to be one of the most dramatic additions: the
use of TrueType fonts.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-031#13:1>
TrueType fonts are scalable to any point size, and what you see on
the screen is what you will get when you print with any Windows-
applications.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-031#14:1>
If you are tired of Cut and Paste between different Windows
applications; this new powerful feature: OLE, Object Linking and Embedding,
can be an enough and sufficient reason for upgrading.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-031#15:1>
Create an object with an application, and embed or dump it in the
destination document which can be in a different application.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-031#16:1>
And when you need to make any changes to this embedded object, just
call up the application which created it, within the destination document!

<ICE-SIN:W2B-031#17:1>
You can link several documents to a source document; and change the
object from within any one of them.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-031#18:1>
The updated version is reflected in all the documents that have a
link to that object!

<ICE-SIN:W2B-031#19:1>
The only limitation: Not all Windows applications support OLE!

<ICE-SIN:W2B-031#20:1>
File Manager in Windows 3.0 wasn't a hit with DOS-command experts.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-031#21:1>
Version 3.1 retains its basic features, but a new look with added
powerful features may change some DOS buffs' minds.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-031#22:1>
This time, the directory window is split, with the left hand portion
showing the directory tree, and the right hand side displaying the current
directory contents.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-031#23:1>
You can choose to display the names of files and directories with
your favourite font; or print a file by dragging its file icon to the
minimised Print Manager window or icon, but this does not work with all types
of files.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-031#24:1>
Forget about Windows 3.1 if you have only 640K memory; since Windows
3.1 does not run on anything less than 1 MB.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-031#25:1>
So upgrade your memory board and be prepared for smoother and faster
switching between Windows and non-Windows applications; faster printing; new
multimedia features; enhanced serial-port support; context-sensitive help
system; screensavers that can be password-protected and many many more.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-031#26:1>
Just look at the number of forums that have been set up all over the
world on Windows and that of magazines' editorial comments on the same
subject; there is no question on the level of interest and enthusiasm among
Windows gurus; but it also proves one thing: that Windows can be a difficult
and frustrating thing to deal with.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-031#27:1>
So whether the young Windows 3.1 can solve the seemingly unsolvable
and intractable problems Windows 3.0 regrettably offers; or whether it will
stop Windows users and programmers from crossing their fingers hoping that
their systems won't hang again; or whether it will meet up to the
expectations of not just those who wish for a more trustworthy interface, but
those who have been panting for those " extra things" that Windows 3.0
lacks...well, only time and the individual can tell.

<h> Why PostScript Printers? </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-031#30:1>
Chong Chiang Seng

<ICE-SIN:W2B-031#31:1>
In the market today, there are mainly two kinds of printers: HP
LaserJet compatibles, and Postscript printers.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-031#32:1>
In this article, I will examine the reasons why PostScript printers
are preferred.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-031#33:1>
<h> PostScript compared with PCL </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-031#34:1>
There are various reasons for using the PostScript printers:

<ICE-SIN:W2B-031#35:1>
- one printer driver for all variety of PostScript printers.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-031#36:1>
- all software that are used in the departments are able to print to
the PostScript printers.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-031#37:1>
This makes installation of software easy and simplifies the
complexity of choosing fonts and cartridges for the users.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-031#38:1>
- PostScript printer is more economical as compared to the HP
LaserJet III.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-031#39:1>
The cartridges and replaceable items are cheaper.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-031#40:1>
Under the university's tender, the PostScript printers cost slightly
more but also offer more.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-031#41:1>
You have 35 built-in fonts as compared to 8 built-in fonts for the
LaserJet III.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-031#42:1>
You have a 16 page-per-minute engine for the PostScript printer
compared to an 8 page-per-minute engine.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-031#43:1>
Printing speed will be discussed later.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-031#44:1>
Suffice to mention that speed is a factor of more than just the
engine speed.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-031#45:1>
But an engine that is built for higher speed would last longer than a
lower speed given the same load.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-031#46:1>
- PostScript offers greater flexibility and ease of use.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-031#47:1>
- PostScript provides more features.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-031#48:1>
- PostScript for compatibility and connectivity.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-031#49:1>
<h> Greater Flexibility and Ease of Use </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-031#50:1>
PostScript is a device and resolution independent printer language,
unlike the PCL5.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-031#51:1>
PCL5 ( Hewlett Packard Printer Control Language 5) like its
predecessors, was designed for a 300 dot-per-inch laser printer.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-031#52:1>
PostScript documents can be printed at any resolution on any printing
technology.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-031#53:1>
PostScript printers range in resolution from 300 to 4000
dots-per-inch, and PostScript is available in laser, color, thermal, inkjet,
typesetter, and film recorder technologies.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-031#54:1>
PCL is available only with a single marking technology at a single
resolution.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-031#55:1>
- Most applications provide a generic PostScript driver that will
drive most PostScript printers.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-031#56:1>
With PostScript printers, there is no need to go in search of the
latest driver to support a new printer.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-031#57:1>
HP requires different drivers for each class in its family.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-031#58:1>
For example, there are at least four different types: LaserJet,
LaserJet Plus, LaserJet II, LaserJet III.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-031#59:1>
- PostScript is supported on many computer systems.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-031#60:1>
PostScript printers easily connect to Macintoshes, PC's, UNIX
workstations and IBM mainframes and provide a broad range of print
technologies for cross-platform support.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-031#61:1>
In fact, the PostScript printer driver comes standard on every
Macintosh.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-031#62:1>
PostScript delivers professional output.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-031#63:1>
For users who need sophisticated requirements and special effects,
PostScript is a necessity.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-031#64:1>
<h> More Features with PostScript </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-031#65:1>
- PostScript provides color and greyscale support.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-031#66:1>
PostScript printers are available with support for color and up to
256 shades of grey.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-031#67:1>
PCL5 does not support color and has very limited greyscale support.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-031#68:1>
- There is more internal font support for PostScript.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-031#69:1>
PostScript printers come standard with at least 35 built-in scalable
outline fonts.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-031#70:1>
The LaserJet III comes with only 8 scalable typefaces.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-031#71:1>
- There is an extensive selection of additional PostScript fonts.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-031#72:1>
The Adobe Type Library has over 550 PostScript typefaces in 120
packages, with more shipping every day.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-031#73:1>
At present, there are more typefaces available for the PostScript
printers than for LaserJet III.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-031#74:1>
<h> PostScript for Compatibility and Connectivity </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-031#75:1>
- One file fits all - file format is portable to any PostScript
device.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-031#76:1>
This means you can print the same files on a laser printer, color
printer, typesetter or film recorder and not have to spend time and effort
recreating, reformatting or modifying a document in order to print on another
device.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-031#77:1>
- One font fits all - font format portability to any PostScript
device.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-031#78:1>
PostScript can generate high quality fonts on any device from a
single representation.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-031#79:1>
Purchase a type package ( eg Helvetica, Times, etc) only once and use
it with any PostScript printer regardless of vendor, resolution, or printing
technology.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-031#80:1>
- Easy connectivity for increased printer sharing.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-031#81:1>
PostScript printers are easy to network.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-031#82:1>
They can be shared among many users thereby greatly reducing the cost
per use.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-031#83:1>
Most PostScript printers come with networking capabilities built-in
or as an option.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-031#84:1>
Therefore, you can easily share one printer among many users.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-031#85:1>
<h> How fast are PostScript printers? </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-031#86:1>
- It is fast enough for any printing and publishing application you
may have.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-031#87:1>
PostScript printers are available today at rated speeds ranging from
four to 40 pages per minute.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-031#88:1>
How fast a specific document prints depends on the design of the
printer, how efficiently the application you're using communicates with the
printer, and how complex the document is.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-031#89:1>
- For 300 dot-per-inch resolution, a text-only document will print
out faster using a LaserJet III than a PostScript printer.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-031#90:1>
As more processing is involved in printing a PostScript document, a
PostScript printer's speed is generally slower than a LaserJet III.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-031#91:1>
However, recent development of RISC processors specifically designed
for graphics processing and PostScript has helped to overcome this problem.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-031#92:1>
And Adobe is developing new controllers based on these latest RISC
technology.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-031#93:1>
In fact, these new controllers are already appearing in the market
now.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-031#94:1>
<h> Conclusion </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-031#95:1>
- In an environment where you have to support Macintosh and PCs, or
where you want to standardize on one printer type, it is good to purchase a
PostScript printer.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-031#96:1>
This will eliminate the fact of managing so many printer drivers for
your applications.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-031#97:1>
And at the same time, you are assured of future support from the
applications you are using.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-031#98:1>
<h> Microsoft's Disk Operating System Version 5.0 </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-031#99:1>
by Ravi Chandran and Tommy Hor

<ICE-SIN:W2B-031#100:1>
Microsoft's Disk Operating System Version 5.0 ( DOS 5.0) was
introduced in late 1991.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-031#101:1>
Though most of the major magazines have already summarized the major
features of DOS 5.0, I was requested by my editor to highlight the more
interesting features and to address the compatibility of this new version
with our current hardware and network environment.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-031#102:1>
<h> DOS 5.0 uses less memory than DOS 4.0 </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-031#103:1>
On a 80286-class ( or higher) systems with at least 1 mega-byte of
memory, DOS 5.0 can load itself in the first 64 kilo-byte of extended memory
( High Memory Area - HMA), leaving more conventional memory available for DOS
applications.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-031#104:1>
To load DOS into the HMA area, you will need these two statements in
your CONFIG.SYS file:

<ICE-SIN:W2B-031#105:1>
DEVICE = HIMEM.SYS

<ICE-SIN:W2B-031#106:1>
DOS = HIGH

<ICE-SIN:W2B-031#107:1>
On a 80386-class ( or higher) systems certain device drivers and
memoryresident programs ( TSRs) can now be loaded to the upper memory blocks
( UMBs) without the need for third party memory managers.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-031#108:1>
This again might free up more conventional memory depending on
whether the device drivers and TSRs work when loaded in the UMBs.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-031#109:1>
Say you wanted to load the ANSI.SYS device driver into the UMBs,
these lines are required: DEVICE = HIMEM.SYS DEVICE = EMM386.EXE DOS = HIGH,
UMB DEVICEHIGH = ANSI.SYS If you wish to load a TSR into UMBs through your
AUTOEXEC.BAT file, simply add " LOADHIGH MOUSE.COM" in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file

<ICE-SIN:W2B-031#110:1>
<h> DOS 5.0 Shell. </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-031#111:1>
With the DOS 5.0 Shell program you can now switch from running one
DOS application program to another without exiting the first program.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-031#112:1>
You can thus switch from the current program to the one you were
working on previously and continue from where you left off.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-031#113:1>
Only one single program can be used at any one time.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-031#114:1>
<h> New and Improved Utilities </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-031#115:1>
DOS 5.0 has added new commands, as well as improvements to existing
commands.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-031#116:1>
New and useful commands include the DOSKEY command which can recall,
edit, and carry out commands that you have already used.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-031#117:1>
UNFORMAT and UNDELETE allow you to undo a format or delete
operation, restoring your disk or file to its original state.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-031#118:1>
<h> On-line Help </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-031#119:1>
On-line help is now available for all MS-DOS 5.0 commands by typing
the command name followed by / ? , or by typing help followed by the command
name.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-031#120:1>
<h> Full Screen Editor </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-031#121:1>
A new full-screen editor to create and modify text files has now
being included with DOS 5.0. <X>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-031#X122:1>
The full-screen editor which can be invoked by the EDIT command
requires QBASIC which comes with DOS 5.0. </X> </I>
