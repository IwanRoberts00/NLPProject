<ICE-SIN:W2D-016#3:1>
<h> High-Rise Orchid Growing </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2D-016#4:1>
Growing orchids as balcony plants or as roof plants has always been
attempted by inveterate enthusiasts lacking a garden.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-016#5:1>
Many an elder pot of Cymbidium or straggly Arachnis can still be
found, along with scanty bougainvilleas and leathery Kheng Wah plants, in the
most unpropitious city sites.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-016#6:1>
However, making orchids flourish under high-rise living conditions
requires some care and attention to the pros and cons of the particular site
and which plants will grow there.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-016#7:1>
The potential for successful balcony growing is actually quite high,
especially given the increasing availability of more or less miniature
plants.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-016#8:1>
Somebody who rents or buys a flat does not usually do so with orchid
growing in mind.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-016#9:1>
Rather, he or she is already living in a flat and wants to know how to
grow orchids on the balcony or other available space.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-016#10:1>
So the emphasis has to be on adapting principles of growing to the
balcony you have, rather than giving a prescription for the ideal balcony
that you will never have.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-016#11:1>
All the basic principles of orchid growing apply on balconies, but
certain difficulties arise in the application of those principles.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-016#12:1>
The main difficulties with balconies relate to shortage of space,
control over sunlight, and drying breezes.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-016#13:1>
<h> SPACE LIMITATIONS </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2D-016#14:1>
Although large plants can be grown, they do take up space, and the
high-rise grower is in effect restricted to smaller plants.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-016#15:1>
But there are other considerations too.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-016#16:1>
Planning use of space is important.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-016#17:1>
You will need to consider how your total balcony area is to be
divided up between laundry drying and other activities requiring space, or
furniture such as a table and chairs.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-016#18:1>
If you do not have a balcony but just a window ledge, consider
whether plants will impede opening and closing windows and so on.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-016#19:1>
Having settled on where you intend to put the plants, bearing in mind
sun and wind ( see below), you will then need to build shelving, benches, or
arrangements for hanging pots.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-016#20:1>
If your balcony is narrow, a single shelf about 15 cm below and
inside the balcony parapet can be considered.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-016#21:1>
This is about waist height, which is convenient for watering,
inspecting the plants and appreciating the blooms.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-016#22:1>
Lowering the shelf 15 cm below the parapet for safety ensures some
extra pot support on the outer side.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-016#23:1>
If the balcony does not have a solid parapet but only railings, it
may be necessary to block the railings so that pots cannot fall through.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-016#24:1>
At this height the plants will be visible from inside the flat
through the window.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-016#25:1>
Bear in mind though that the blooms will tend to grow towards the
light, and thus will tend to grow outwards over the balcony, or through the
railings, if the sprays are long.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-016#26:1>
Only turn the plants around to enjoy the sprays once the flowers are
all opened, otherwise the sprays will bend back to get to the light.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-016#27:1>
Though tempting, do not construct shelving projecting outside the
balcony parapet.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-016#28:1>
Its use would be a hazard to those below and is illegal.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-016#29:1>
If the width of the balcony permits, a second shelf can be built
below and further out, a step down from the top.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-016#30:1>
This shelf will be more shaded.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-016#31:1>
Alternatively, if suitable, the wall dividing the balcony from the
flat can be used to as a site for shelving or to hang pots.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-016#32:1>
Pots can be hung from hooks directly mounted in the wall, or into
battens of hardwood mounted for the purpose, in combination with shelving if
desired.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-016#33:1>
Another decorative alternative is to mount a robust trellis against
the wall, with or without training a creeper on it.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-016#34:1>
Orchid pots can then be hooked on to the trellis.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-016#35:1>
Even more ambitious growers may find it possible to construct a
complete miniature orchid frame with provisions to hang pots or grow them on
benches as desired.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-016#36:1>
Ingenuity and a little thought can lead to very effective use of
limited space, limited only by one's creativity and the restrictions of
relevant regulations.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-016#37:1>
For those not fortunate enough to have balconies, windowsills will
do, but when the plants are watered provision must be made to catch the
surplus, so a suitable trough and a means to drain it are needed.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-016#38:1>
Generous watering is always needed with orchids potted in the
necessary loose potting materials, since 90@c of the water poured on runs
straight through.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-016#39:1>
Attempts to grow orchids on windowsills only using spray misting or
small trickles of water are likely to result in plants that are too dry.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-016#40:1>
If you are tempted to try growing orchids in the office, note that
offices face the problem that many are air-conditioned during the day but
not at night.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-016#41:1>
This reverses the cycle of cooler nights that most orchids prefer.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-016#42:1>
It is not known if any orchids like a combination of cooler days,
warmer nights and limited illumination.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-016#43:1>
<h> SUNLIGHT CONTROL </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2D-016#44:1>
How much sunlight a balcony gets depends on which way it faces and
the architecture of the building.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-016#45:1>
Some balconies are more or less completely shaded.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-016#46:1>
On such balconies it is possible to grow a range of shade orchids.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-016#47:1>
Other balconies are exposed to direct sunlight for at least part of
the day, getting more or less according to their orientation and the season
of the year.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-016#48:1>
Sunlight shows considerable seasonal variation.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-016#49:1>
North- or South-facing balconies will have seasonal differences in
the amount of sunlight.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-016#50:1>
The seasonal shifts in the sun's path may move the shadow on a
balcony a surprising amount, and create great variation in the duration of
direct sunlight.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-016#51:1>
It is common to find that a shady spot has become a sunny one through
the changes in the sun's path.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-016#52:1>
This can have disastrous effects on the plants if it is not
anticipated.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-016#53:1>
It is necessary to provide extra shade or move the plants, possibly
by having pots on a trolley rather than a fixed rack or stand.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-016#54:1>
East- or west-facing balconies are spared this variation, but cannot
have more than about six hours sunlight per day.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-016#55:1>
Even on quite sunny balconies, full sun genera will not usually
flower freely, since the sunlight is almost invariably restricted to some
part of the day, either morning or afternoon, or is seasonal.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-016#56:1>
But this means that shading has to be considered anyway.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-016#57:1>
As was discussed in Chapter Three, it is necessary to provide some
break or shading from direct sun for those plants that cannot take full sun.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-016#58:1>
To repeat the point, a morning of full sun followed by an afternoon
of shade is not the same as 50% sunlight.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-016#59:1>
It is 100% sun followed by 100% shade.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-016#60:1>
So it is necessary to find some means of dappling or breaking the
sunlight during those hours when the sun is shining directly on the plants,
to avoid burning them.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-016#61:1>
Shading on balconies can be achieved in various ways.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-016#62:1>
Hardy foliage pot plants can be used as shading plants, or a
framework to support vertical or horizontal shading nets can be used.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-016#63:1>
Such shade netting when used vertically can also provide a measure of
windbreak.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-016#64:1>
Creepers trained on wires can also be used to provide shade screening
and are attractive in their own right.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-016#65:1>
Grilled balconies provide an easy way of adding netting, but such
balconies are likely to be shaded anyway unless facing more or less east.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-016#66:1>
Windbreaks are especially helpful if you are growing shade-loving
orchids, since they are usually not tolerant of drying conditions, and need
good sun protection.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-016#67:1>
However, in all cases, genera that are tolerant of drying out are
generally better for balconies.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-016#68:1>
In any of these arrangements the grower will have to observe
regulations governing the use of the balcony.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-016#69:1>
<h> DRYING BREEZES </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2D-016#70:1>
High places tend to be windy, and this dehydrates the plants.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-016#71:1>
It can also lead to some damage if plants are hanging and can swing,
or if they have long inflorescences that can sway about when a breeze blows.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-016#72:1>
On the other hand, fungal problems created by stagnant air and damp
conditions are not usually a problem in high-rise growing.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-016#73:1>
<h> Coping with Drying Breezes </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2D-016#74:1>
Use a less open potting mixture, with unperforated pots - for better
moisture retention.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-016#75:1>
Plastic pots also keep the mixture moist longer.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-016#76:1>
Avoid trying to grow plants on fern root slabs or on logs, or other
materials where the roots are mostly exposed.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-016#77:1>
Water more often than in exposed sites.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-016#78:1>
Provide some form of windbreak as mentioned above.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-016#79:1>
Avoid growing species or hybrids which are especially sensitive to
drying out.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-016#80:1>
This includes Jewel Orchids, Paphiopediums, and many Phalaenopsis.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-016#81:1>
Use stakes or wires to provide more rigid support for flower spikes.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-016#82:1>
Try growing ferns or other foliage plants beneath the orchids.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-016#83:1>
They thrive on the surplus fertilizer that runs off the orchids on
them, and they help provide a moister environment for the orchids.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-016#84:1>
Put down wettable mats.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-016#85:1>
<h> WATERING </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2D-016#86:1>
Balconies are usually dry places, since their floors are designed for
quick drainage.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-016#87:1>
Concrete, tile or mosaic flooring can get very hot in direct sun, and
dries very quickly as it does not retain moisture.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-016#88:1>
The more such a floor can be covered by benching or pots the better.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-016#89:1>
Covering such exposed areas with moisture - retaining materials -
artificial grass or other kinds of matting for example - should also be
considered.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-016#90:1>
Real enthusiasts will find it very helpful to have a tap installed on
the balcony.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-016#91:1>
If there is no such convenient supply, water will have to be carried
through from elsewhere, which is troublesome.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-016#92:1>
It is also much better, if possible, to allow water to run through
pots and drain off on to the floor.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-016#93:1>
Few individuals have the time and patience to take the pots to some
place else for watering.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-016#94:1>
Moreover, plants on high-rise sites often need more frequent
watering because of drying breezes.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-016#95:1>
For these reasons anything that enhances humidity on the balcony is
valuable.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-016#96:1>
Orchid plants do not like to 'have their feet wet.'

<ICE-SIN:W2D-016#97:1>
Drainage is important and the pots should never be grown standing in
saucers or pans of water to promote humidity.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-016#98:1>
It is permissible to stand pots on trays of gravel, so long as the
pots are not actually wet.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-016#99:1>
<h> ADVANTAGES OF HIGH-RISE GROWING </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2D-016#100:1>
There are a number of advantages in using balconies.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-016#101:1>
Pests are less of a problem: a collection of orchids on a balcony is
more isolated from other plants, and therefore pests are less likely to visit
the collection.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-016#102:1>
As well as fewer common pests, such as scale insects, this also
means fewer bird dropping or bees pollinating the flowers.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-016#103:1>
Although domestic pests like ants and cockroaches may still be
present, they are much easier to control.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-016#104:1>
As well as reduced pests, diseases are also less of a problem for
balcony growers.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-016#105:1>
In particular, the disadvantages of breezes are also their
advantages in helping to keep the plants free of disease.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-016#106:1>
Restricted space always makes highrise growers careful about adding
to their collections, and it pays off handsomely if such growers only choose
healthy pest-free plants.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-016#107:1>
Similarly, weeds are less of a problem, as the seeds do not get to
the orchid pots so easily.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-016#108:1>
A word should be put in here to stress the potential of miniature
plants for the balcony or indoor grower.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-016#109:1>
Technically a miniature is a plant which is mature at not more than
15 cm high, but in this book the term is used loosely to refer to any orchid
which is small by the standards normally found among orchids of that general
type.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-016#110:1>
Growers in temperate climates, faced with expensive heating bills,
have often specialized in miniature plants to save space, especially plants
that will grow under more temperate conditions.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-016#111:1>
An emphasis on miniatures has not hitherto been a feature of
tropical growing, but there is no reason why it should not be, as the number
of would-be growers with restricted space increases.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-016#112:1>
Anyone whose space is limited, even in a garden, can find great
satisfaction in miniatures or smaller varieties. <X>

<ICE-SIN:W2D-016#X113:1>
These have a great charm of their own and should not at all be
thought of as second rate substitutes for larger plants.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-016#X114:1>
They are well worth growing in their own right.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-016#X115:1>
It is to be hoped that more individuals will be tempted to attempt
growing orchids under high-rise conditions, and will inform OSSlA of their
experience, so that the benefits of their efforts can be passed on.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-016#X116:1>
It is also our hope that trends to miniaturization, especially in
Dendrobiums, Vandas and Oncidiums, will provide the grower with an increasing
range of viable windowsill and balcony plants. </X> </I>
