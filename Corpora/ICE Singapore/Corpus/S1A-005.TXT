<$D> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-005#24:1:D>

<ICE-SIN:S1A-005#232:1:D>
That's in town itself right

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-005#233:1:C>
Yah town itself

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-005#234:1:A>
She didn't want to stay at the beaches uh Malacca or
somewhere

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-005#235:1:C>
One day what

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-005#236:1:A>
Oh one day only

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-005#237:1:C>
One day only

<$D> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-005#238:1:D>
Ha

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-005#239:1:A>
Aiyah

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-005#240:1:C>
Left yesterday morning

<ICE-SIN:S1A-005#241:1:C>
Coming back today

<$D> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-005#242:1:D>
Aiyah

<ICE-SIN:S1A-005#243:1:D>
The way you talk like she went for three four days or one week

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-005#244:1:A>
That's why

<ICE-SIN:S1A-005#245:1:A>
'Thot who was could have such a good morning

<$D> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-005#246:1:D>
That's why he said come back today

<ICE-SIN:S1A-005#247:1:D>
I said A gone so long already

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-005#248:1:A>
Why didn't she go longer

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-005#249:1:B>
Oh

<ICE-SIN:S1A-005#250:1:B>
<O> laughs </O>

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-005#251:1:C>
Well it's only a one-day tour

<$D> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-005#252:1:D>
Did then why don't you go with her

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-005#253:1:C>
Why didn't I go

<ICE-SIN:S1A-005#254:1:C>
Because it was all ladies

<ICE-SIN:S1A-005#255:1:C>
They are going and go and shop and one thing which I don't like to
do is to shop

<$D> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-005#256:1:D>
But you can always go there and do other things what

<ICE-SIN:S1A-005#257:1:D>
You sit auto and watch video

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-005#258:1:A>
Or go to the pool and laze around

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-005#259:1:C>
Stereo I don't know

<ICE-SIN:S1A-005#260:1:C>
Today suddenly we all seem to be so quiet

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-005#261:1:A>
You need you need some key players

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-005#262:1:C>
Yah as though we felt that our voices will be recorded

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-005#263:1:A>
We need Su Lian

<ICE-SIN:S1A-005#264:1:A>
Su Lian will probably say something like 'Oh yes yes lah

<ICE-SIN:S1A-005#265:1:A>
What do you want me to say

<ICE-SIN:S1A-005#266:1:A>
And then she'll go on

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-005#267:1:C>
But these days you never know

<ICE-SIN:S1A-005#268:1:C>
Uh they could be recording your voices anywhere

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-005#269:1:A>
Over the telephone ah

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-005#270:1:C>
Yah even now while we are counting money

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-005#271:1:A>
Ah <unclear> word </unclear> Is it illegal

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-005#272:1:C>
Ss not illegal lah

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-005#273:1:A>
I know the police and all that do that lah

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-005#274:1:C>
Uhm

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-005#275:1:A>
But isn't that illegal

<ICE-SIN:S1A-005#276:1:A>
It's illegal overseas

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-005#277:1:C>
There's no right of privacy here

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-005#278:1:A>
Ha Singapore ah

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-005#279:1:C>
Yah

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-005#280:1:A>
Really ah

<ICE-SIN:S1A-005#281:1:A>
What do you mean no right of privacy at all

<$D> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-005#282:1:D>
You mean in the States they couldn't do that

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-005#283:1:A>
No they they

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-005#284:1:C>
<unclear> word </unclear>

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-005#285:1:A>
Apparently they can tape your phone conversation and use it
as a what evidence in court ah

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-005#286:1:C>
The only thing they can't do is give your IC number your your
address

<ICE-SIN:S1A-005#287:1:C>
If you write to <unclear> word </unclear> because there's a some
uh section in the National Registration Act which says that whatever
information inside there

<$D> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-005#288:1:D>
But they wouldn't know it's

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-005#289:1:C>
is private and confidential except to the authorities

<$D> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-005#290:1:D>
But then they have to prove that it's it was you on the phone
nah

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-005#291:1:A>
Easy what

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-005#292:1:C>
Yah

<$D> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-005#293:1:D>
How

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-005#294:1:A>
Probably get you to talk on the phone again and do a voice
read

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-005#295:1:C>
Uhm

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-005#296:1:A>
Okay could you snore

<ICE-SIN:S1A-005#297:1:A>
I want you to read this sentence

<ICE-SIN:S1A-005#298:1:A>
I want you to read these these same words

<$D> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-005#299:1:D>
But how proof how fool-proof is

<ICE-SIN:S1A-005#300:1:D>
uh how fool-proof is a voice

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-005#301:1:C>
Yes not fool-proof

<ICE-SIN:S1A-005#302:1:C>
You know you can never proof by uh signature yah

<ICE-SIN:S1A-005#303:1:C>
The

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-005#304:1:A>
So forgery all that lah

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-005#305:1:C>
In Singapore at least none of the I mean tech officers will
go down and confirm that that is the writing of someone

<$D> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-005#306:1:D>
But this kind of things they will only do if it's something
real serious like

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-005#307:1:C>
Yah

<$D> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-005#308:1:D>
you you confess that you murdered someone or you posted to
your friends

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-005#309:1:C>
Yah

<ICE-SIN:S1A-005#310:1:C>
No they'll probably send it to England and give someone to
positively confirm

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-005#311:1:A>
As a <unclear> word </unclear>

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-005#312:1:C>
Yah

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-005#313:1:A>
as evidence

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-005#314:1:C>
Yah

<$D> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-005#315:1:D>
So what is actually the amount of tapes they use

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-005#316:1:C>
Yah

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-005#317:1:A>
So if you don't have right of privacy right you mean down
here you don't need a warrant to walk into your house

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-005#318:1:C>
They need

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-005#319:1:A>
So there's still privacy there what

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-005#320:1:C>
I know but privacy in the sense of recording your
conversations

<$D> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-005#321:1:D>
So there's no sanctuary not like in the Old Testament times
where you can run to a village and then nobody can

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-005#322:1:A>
Or run run to a church ah

<$D> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-005#323:1:D>
Then how

<ICE-SIN:S1A-005#324:1:D>
Or run to your room

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-005#325:1:A>
Why

<$D> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-005#326:1:D>
The sanctuary

<ICE-SIN:S1A-005#327:1:D>
Would would they arrest someone in the sanctuary

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-005#328:1:C>
I don't think they want

<ICE-SIN:S1A-005#329:1:C>
They'll probably wait until

<$D> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-005#330:1:D>
So so you go you go there and you just sit there and sit
tight you know

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-005#331:1:A>
'A' in countries uh you are

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-005#332:1:C>
But then you charge uh an embassy they wouldn't go into an
embassy what

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-005#333:1:A>
Yah because neutral ground

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-005#334:1:C>
Because neutral yah it's considered part of the territory of
the other country

<$D> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-005#335:1:D>
the other country

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-005#336:1:A>
So so so would the church be neutral ground

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-005#337:1:C>
No

<$D> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-005#338:1:D>
The land still owns the government still owns the land

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-005#339:1:C>
Yah yah

<$D> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-005#340:1:D>
Embassy

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-005#341:1:C>
Embassy no

<ICE-SIN:S1A-005#342:1:C>
It's part of the

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-005#343:1:A>
But overseas it is isn't it

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-005#344:1:C>
Yeh

<ICE-SIN:S1A-005#345:1:C>
That's why you have certain cases like that <unclear> word
</unclear>

<$D> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-005#346:1:D>
So let's say you rob a bank uh you carry a bundle of money
like that you you know you run and police chasing you and you jump into the

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-005#347:1:C>
Yah

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-005#348:1:A>
embassy F&

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-005#349:1:C>
The embassy

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-005#350:1:A>
The embassy'll probably find out that you are a robber and
throw you out lah

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-005#351:1:C>
Yah

<ICE-SIN:S1A-005#352:1:C>
No they I mean if even in that sort of a situation if the police
run in

<$D> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-005#353:1:D>
They

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-005#354:1:C>
I think they wouldn't

<$D> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-005#355:1:D>
They won't lah

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-005#356:1:C>
raise a fuss about it lah

<ICE-SIN:S1A-005#357:1:C>
So by because at the end of the day you must see what are they
going to do

<ICE-SIN:S1A-005#358:1:C>
Are they going to declare war

<ICE-SIN:S1A-005#359:1:C>
Or cut off diplomatic relations

<$D> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-005#360:1:D>
Over you uh over a bank over a bank robber only

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-005#361:1:C>
Yah

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-005#362:1:A>
We may we may do some diplomatic relations with Russia ah

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-005#363:1:C>
Yah

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-005#364:1:A>
Su Lian is there

<$D> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-005#365:1:D>
Ooh I took it just so that I can donate to to the poor people
in Russia

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-005#366:1:A>
And Russian will probably say something like

<$D> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-005#367:1:D>
Buy food buy food for the poor children

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-005#368:1:A>
The lawyer probably say something like I don't know you know
you don't know I don't know uh

<ICE-SIN:S1A-005#369:1:A>
It probably saves in efforts

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-005#370:1:C>
Yeh

<ICE-SIN:S1A-005#371:1:C>
Well this is the last session of the year

<$D> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-005#372:1:D>
It's very quiet session

<ICE-SIN:S1A-005#373:1:D>
So aren't you going to turn it off </I>
