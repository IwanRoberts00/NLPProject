Q1 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-017#2:1>
Indeed, to explain for the
slow progress in late-Ching's industrialization, two approaches were being
put forward, namely the domestic-limitation approach and the
foreign-intervention approach. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-017#3:1>
The domestic elements in
particular the traditional institution and ideologies had inhibited the
progress of modern enterprises but it was the foreign intrusion that was the
greatest evil of the two. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-017#4:1>
The failure in China's
industrial development can be directly attributed to the negative effects of
foreign intrusion and dominance in the Chinese economic sphere.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-017#5:1>
According to the domestic-limitation approach,
Confucianism and its traditional institution had prohibited China's path to
industrialisation and that China's institutions must be replaced by western
ones before it can industrialise. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-017#6:1>
The theorists had
argued that every movement of westernization had been obstructed at every
turn by the ignorant and prejudiced Confucian literati. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-017#7:1>
The Confucian spirit against scientific research was strong, and they also
discourage general economic growth through a capitalist economy and the
suppression of merchants class. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-017#8:1>
merchants were not
allow to challenge government monopolies as well as the prerogatives of the
government officials. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-017#9:1>
There was an element of truth in
the domestic limitation approach in the account of inhibiting late Ching's
industrialization, I would not fault the Confucian culture.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-017#10:1>
In fact, the Ching government had began to encourage
private enterprises and in 1908, it had also established the new western
style commercial code to give protection to Chinese joint stock company.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-017#11:1>
More importantly, in 1905, the civil service
examinations were abolished. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-017#12:1>
Yet, China had still
failed in its industrialization despite the great effort that government had
put in. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-017#13:1>
As to the point that the elite was ignorant or
prejudice against modern technology, this argument could not hold because the
attitude of this class had changed by the turn of 19th century.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-017#14:1>
This was evident in foremost leaders like Li Hung
change, Chang Chih Tung and Chang Chien who was aware of the need for China
to industrialise and modernise. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-017#15:1>
This was illustrated
in official sponsored modern enterprises such as kuan tu shan pan and kuan tu
ho pan which clearly showed that the elite like the other government
officials and gentry had realized the feasibilities of merchant cooperation.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-017#16:1>
This was further illustrated in Chang Chien's act, who
resigned from government as a scholar-official. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-017#17:1>
In his
attempt to look for financial and managerial backing, he did not turn to
merchants unlike others such as Chou Hsueh Hsu. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-017#18:1>
hence,
from Li Hung Chang, Chang Chien and Chang Chih Tung, it showed that the elite
class do have a positive attitude towards industrialization.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-017#19:1>
Thus, the domestic-limitation approach's argument
that the elite class as a obstacle to industrialization could not really hold
in that sense. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-017#20:1>
In addition, internal succession
problem and court disputes were responsible for inhibiting China's
industrialization. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-017#21:1>
With constant court intrigues and
succession problems, the Chinese Empire fell into the hands of empress Tsu
Xi. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-017#22:1>
The empress using all her energy, intelligence and
cunning scheme had tried to keep all power in her hands.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-017#23:1>
Hence, China in the first half of 20th century was
ruled by central authority who was not able to understand the necessity or
the urgency for China to industrialise. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-017#24:1>
Worst still,
it was not only passive, but was always in opposition to innovation

<ICE-SIN:W1A-017#25:1>
Thus, from the above, one can see that the domestic
environment had indeed served as a hindrance to late Ching's
industrialization progress. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-017#26:1>
However, besides this
approach, one also had to take into consideration of the foreign intervention
approach which I think have generated greater negative effects

<ICE-SIN:W1A-017#27:1>
And constrains in China's slowness in
industrialization. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-017#28:1>
The modernisation approach had
argued that foreign trade and investments were beneficial to China's
development. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-017#29:1>
The theorist of this approach such as Chu
Ming Hsi had argued that the foreign trade and investments were innovative
forces that provided China with whatever modernisation or preconditions she
had before 1937. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-017#30:1>
But, other authors like Murphy,
Stephen Thomas and Gemet had different views. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-017#31:1>
Murphy
had put forward the argument that the Chinese treaty ports had failed to
built up a respectable volume of new trade. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-017#32:1>
The treaty
ports had failed to induce a lasting or self perpetuating variety of
modernisation. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-017#33:1>
it was true that foreign innovations in
the treaty ports, foreign technology and institutional effectiveness had left
an impact on the Chinese intellectuals, but this impact was neither deep nor
widespread. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-017#34:1>
Moreover, the treaty ports main concern
was only with a few commodities with opium and cotton among the imports and
tea and silk among the exports. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-017#35:1>
The overall
contribution of the treaty port was too marginal to have been seen as aspect
of modernisation. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-017#36:1>
In view of this, Murphy had likened
the treaty ports as " a fly on an elephant" with very modest growth and its
effects on other sectors were very low. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-017#37:1>
Both Stephen
Thomas and Gemet subscribed to the imperialist approach.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-017#38:1>
They had the same opinion that it was foreign
intrusion and dominance that prohibited the growth of native industries and
enterprises. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-017#39:1>
Together with this was the unequal
treaties and indemnities imposed upon China that further weakened her ability
in industrialisation. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-017#40:1>
Stephen Thomas had argued that
the failure or slowness of China's attempts in industrialization was due to
the constraints imposed upon it by foreign intrusions and unfair trade
system. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-017#41:1>
Foreign interventionists, in particular, the
British had used its military superiority might to intervene in free market
mechanisms, created artificial advantages for foreign enterprises, and also
prevent the government from assuming even a minimum responsibilities which
were necessary to support successful economic growth and industrialisation.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-017#42:1>
The foreigners also prevented China from enjoying the
benefits of its export of tea and silk by preventing the Chinese government
from banning the hugh import of opium. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-017#43:1>
Stephen Thomas
had felt that if there was no opium import, China would have a considerable
amount of foreign exchange surpluses and could use these surpluses to import
foreign technology as Japan did. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-017#44:1>
Unfortunately, by
forcing China to import opium, the British was able to neutralise China's
trade and kept it almost constantly in the negative balance of trade.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-017#45:1>
Besides the opium trade which was imposed on China
through military coercion, there was also the unequal treaties that deprived
China of her tariff control which was fixed at only 5%.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-017#46:1>
Thus, foreign intrusion had led to limitation of
sovereignty and this limited sovereignty had resulted in diminishing control
of crucial areas of economic planning and support. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-017#47:1>
This will in turn prevent the implementation of important economic policies
necessary for China's industrialisation process. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-017#48:1>
Gemet
had argued that constant acts of aggression by the foreigners in China had
caused China to concentrate its industrialization on military aspects and
thus deprived China from providing herself with infrastructures that was
essential for industrial growth. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-017#49:1>
Gemet had argued that
foreign modest of life, behaviour, their pretensions and wealth and the
humiliation they had inflicted upon China had created in the Chinese a sense
of inferiority complex. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-017#50:1>
This was to harm gravely the
process of adaptation to the great changes occurring in contemporary period.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-017#51:1>
In the matter of modernisation, Gemet augured that
China had rejected it through a xenophobic reflex what she would have
accepted had she been more independent. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-017#52:1>
In addition to
the above, the series of defeats experience by China was worth mentioning.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-017#53:1>
After the defeat of the opium war 1840, a string of
defeats followed such as the Franco-Chinese incident of 1884 and
Sino-Japanese war of 1894 with the harsh conditions imposed by the foreigners
after their victories had greatly weakened China's independence and her
ability to resist. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-017#54:1>
After the signing of Shimonoseki
Treaty and the extraction of hugh indemnities from China after the Boxer
Rebellion, the foreign pressure not only act as incitement in China but also
economically, politically, socially and even a psychological one which had
cause the birth and development of hostility among Chinese which was often
extended to the innovations the foreigners introduced. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-017#55:1>
Compared to Japan, who had succeeded in industrialisation because of an
efficient control government and resources, China had none.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-017#56:1>
The Japanese government was able to extract revenues
from peasants through the taxes levied on them. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-017#57:1>
China's because it had always preferred a low-cost government was thus unable
to extract much revenues from the provinces and hence suffered the lack of
capital that was essential for industrialisation purposes.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-017#58:1>
In conclusion, though the country's domestic
environment had played a part in prohibiting late Ching's industrialisation,
the foreign intrusion had a part to play too. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-017#59:1>
it was,
in my opinion, that foreign intrusion and dominance more responsible for the
slow progress in China industrialisation. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-017#60:1>
This was
because with the defeats in war, the foreigners demanded unequal treaties and
huge indemnities which China as a defeater could not bargain but to submit
quietly, such treaties had given foreigners more privileges in China and was
hence able to control China's economic sphere and manipulate it to their
advantage. </I>

<ICE-SIN:W1A-017#61:2>
Q3 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-017#62:2>
Prior to the 20th
century, the Chinese economy was largely agrarian. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-017#63:2>
Agriculture was the main occupation of a large part of the population.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-017#64:2>
Between mid 18th century and mid 19th century, China's
population had surpassed the 400 million mark and thus created population
pressures. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-017#65:2>
However, the traditional agriculture was
able to expand and adjust itself to meet the overpopulation challenge and
prevented massive unemployment, and at the same time maintaining the living
standards of the populace. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-017#66:2>
China's cultivated land was
small in comparison to the population. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-017#67:2>
Hence, it
created a very competitive environment which influenced and was reflect in
various Chinese way of life. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-017#68:2>
Socially, it had led to
the establishment of class and lineage groupings. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-017#69:2>
Economically, it had its impacts on farming institutions and the choice of
farming technology. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-017#70:2>
Overpopulation had laid its impact
on technological preference of the producers which was to delay China in the
adoption of modern technology. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-017#71:2>
By technological
preference, Chao Kang meant that traditional labour-intensive method was
preferred, rather than labour-saving methods. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-017#72:2>
This
backward trend in technological preference was manifested in various ways.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-017#73:2>
The fact that Chinese after 12th century had stopped
inventing new labour-saving implements and the abandonment of those that were
invented before 12th century was one such example. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-017#74:2>
After, the ability of Chinese to invent new labour-saving implements before
12th century had proved that the Chinese was not conservative to change
neither were they backward to invent. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-017#75:2>
Rather, the
change was due to a change in technological preference as labour-intensive
technology will help to absorb the large population and prevent large-scale
unemployment. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-017#76:2>
Although traditional technology was
preferred, it does not mean that traditional technology was static.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-017#77:2>
The combination of a rising population with an
institution framework that did not discourage improvements had resulted in an
increase in grain output. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-017#78:2>
This meant that there was an
definite quantitative increase in total grain production.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-017#79:2>
This was made possible because of the opening up of
lands previously deem suitable for uncultivation. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-017#80:2>
Since the beginning of Sung, many Chinese had migrated to Kwantung, Kweichou,
Yunnan and Szechuan. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-017#81:2>
This was continued into the Ming-
Ching period. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-017#82:2>
The Chinese also moved to Manchuria
homeland in the north east and north west. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-017#83:2>
They opened
hilly and low-lying lands and terraced the fields in the mountains.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-017#84:2>
This was made possible by the technological
advancement. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-017#85:2>
This was especially true in terracing the
fields because only with new technological advance could water be carried up
to the mountain slopes. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-017#86:2>
By the 20th century, the
cultivated lands were four times of that in the 14-century.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-017#87:2>
This had led to the in increase in half of acreage
output and other half was from grain yields per unit. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-017#88:2>
The Rural households was able to cope with rising population pressure was due
to several factors. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-017#89:2>
This factors also helped to
explain why the traditional technology was able to expand and adjust itself
to meet the population pressure while at the same time maintain the living
standard of the populace. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-017#90:2>
One of the factor was the
expansion of double-cropped areas or the transformation of the
double-cropping system. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-017#91:2>
Population growth and water
control ? 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-017#92:2>
played a great role in this expansion and
change. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-017#93:2>
The double-cropping of rice and wheat, wheat
and barley or even two rice crops in a year was practised. <X>

<ICE-SIN:W1A-017#X94:2>
Thus, in these activities, large amount of labour was
required. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-017#X95:2>
Especially in rice cultivation, water
supply was of major importance. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-017#X96:2>
Thus, the operation
of this system was able to absorb the large population especially during the
time when the first crop was harvested and land prepared and the planting of
second crop. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-017#X97:2>
All these had to be done in a very short
period, hence heavy labour consumption was a requirement.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-017#X98:2>
Thus, the expansion and change of this system had
made overpopulation unobservable rather it had instead created a misleading
sense of labour shortages among the cultivation. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-017#X99:2>
Thus, the traditional technology was able to absorb the overpopulation
pressure through its labour intensive technology, which in turn had also lead
to further population growth. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-017#X100:2>
In other words, the
labour-intensive technology was paradoxically the solution to overpopulation
while it also the cause of further population growth.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-017#X101:2>
Another factor was the importation of new improved
seeds and new crops from America. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-017#X102:2>
This had the
effect of increasing yields, reduction in crop failures and enhanced double
cropping. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-017#X103:2>
New crops such as corns and potatoes were
two major ones. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-017#X104:2>
With new improved seeds and new
corps, it was able to lead to expansion of the cultivated land, increased the
yields and hence able to support the population. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-017#X105:2>
Contribution also cane from the capital imputs of water works construction.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-017#X106:2>
Such construction had made possible the cultivation
of rice in land where otherwise dry-land crops had to be cultivated.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-017#X107:2>
Besides, enhancing the process of doublecropping,
water works had also made way rice cultivation possible and it had left a
great impact on the productivity of land in any given area.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-017#X108:2>
Moreover, the construction of water works was able
to absorb a great deal of labour hence absorbing the overpopulation pressure,
while enhancing the output of grain. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-017#X109:2>
Increased in
fertilizer was important too. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-017#X110:2>
The most common form
of fertilizer was nightsoil and with the increased in the population, more
fertilizer was made available for agriculture. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-017#X111:2>
Thus,
from the above, one can see that the traditional agriculture sector was able
to expand and adjust itself to meet the challenge of the overpopulation
pressure. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-017#X112:2>
By the 19th and 20th century, the changes
in the cropping system and the increased in traditional capital imputs per
unit had succeeded in increasing the national grain yields per month with all
the grains taken together. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-017#X113:2>
This was closely tied up
with population growth and the further expansion of labour.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-017#X114:2>
Thus, a vicious cycle was created, whereby the
changes were meant to absorb the overpopulation pressure had simultaneously
led to further expansion of the population. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-017#X115:2>
However,
the preference for traditional techniques or technology had resulted in the
delayed of adoption of modern technology in imperial China.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-017#X116:2>
Labour-intensive method was preferred because it was
the only way that the rural households can cope with rising population
pressure. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-017#X117:2>
Hence, labour-saving method was not much
useful. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-017#X118:2>
Rather if adopted would lead to an abundant
of labour and unemployment of large-scale with the consequence of social and
political instability. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-017#X119:2>
Thus, the labour-intensive
method was adopted because of practical reasons with regard to socio-economic
environment. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-017#X120:2>
In conclusion, China had reached a
population trap with institutional flexibility had worsened the situation.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-017#X121:2>
The institutional flexibility was able to absorb the
overpopulation pressure by it had also caused further population growth.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-017#X122:2>
If this was to continue on, China will reach the
high level equilibrium trap whereby more outputs can only be attained with
the aid of modern technology. </X> </I>
