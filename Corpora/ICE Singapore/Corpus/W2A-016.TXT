<h> Introduction </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-016#4:1>
Factors contributing to migration decision making in modern times are
much more complex than in the early days when the primary motive to emigrate
was essentially economic.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-016#5:1>
This motive of improving on one's life chances can be expressed in
terms of finding a job that would earn one a subjectively better living.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-016#6:1>
The formation, change, and persistence of the occupational patterns of
immigrants have naturally been a great concern in many studies on early
immigrants.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-016#7:1>
Enquiries into Chinese immigration are no exception.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-016#8:1>
Early Chinese immigrants in North America exhibited a universal
occupational pattern, because they were mainly slotted into residual
categories of occupations which were deemed menial and undesirable.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-016#9:1>
While capitalism, imperialism, and colonialism well account for Asian
migratory movements before the Second World War, the host countries' work
environment, which was regulated by both labour market forces and immigration
laws, determined the type of job an immigrant held.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-016#10:1>
Contract labourers were left with no choice as to type of work and
location of worksites.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-016#11:1>
The majority of Chinese contract workers recruited during 1861-70
worked in gold mines, railroad construction, and later in plantation and
farming.2 Early voluntary immigrants and freed contract labourers were also
not gien any better range of occupational choice in North America.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-016#12:1>
Research findings consistently portray them as operators in
businesses such as restaurants, laundry shops, and grocery stores.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-016#13:1>
A Chinese immigrant's occupation was thus highly predictable, because
of the limited range of occupational categories that were available to him.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-016#14:1>
Chinese immigrants to the British Straits Settlements were by and
large of the same two categories: contract labourers and voluntary
immigrants.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-016#15:1>
The range of occupational choices for contract labourers did not seem
to be much wider than that of their counterparts in North America, partly
because the nature of capitalism, imperialism, and colonialism varied very
little within a specific time period.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-016#16:1>
They were recruited chiefly as labourers to work in mining sites and
plantations of many kinds as in North America where the immigrants' former
settlements later developed into towns and cities, environs of worksites of
the Chinese immigrants were also transformed into urban areas.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-016#17:1>
Voluntary Chinese immigrants and freed contract labourers in the
Settlements differed considerably from their North American counterparts in
two important aspects of occupational choice.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-016#18:1>
First, except for the professional class of occupations which very
few of them were qualified to hold, the early Chinese immigrants were
reported to be in the other four major occupational classes, namely,
domestic, commercial, industrial, and agricultural.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-016#19:1>
The type of vocations in these four classes spanned a wide spectrum,
ranging from hawking to financing.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-016#20:1>
The degree of internal constraint on the immigrants is the second
point of departure.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-016#21:1>
For the Chinese immigrants as a whole in the Settlements, external
constraints were manageable, but internally self-created constraints as a
result of rigid group boundary were relatively imposing.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-016#22:1>
The constraints created therefrom naturally reduced the immigrants'
choice on a group basis.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-016#23:1>
Such internal constraints were not felt among the North American
Chinese immigrants, because of their relatively monolithic composition in
dialect/locality origins: most of them were from siyi, or the four districts
Xinning/Taishan, Xinhui, Kaiping, and Enping) and sanyi, or the three
districts Nanhai, Panyu, and Shunde.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-016#24:1>
Given the two conditions, namely externally imposed constraints and
internally created group constraints, four models of occupational choice are
possible.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-016#25:1>
The two extreme models are each characterized by " externally
free-internally free" ( EF/IF) and " externally constrained-internally
constrained" ( EC/IC) conditions.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-016#26:1>
The other two may be seen as conditions that are " externally
constrained-internally free" ( EC/IF) and " externally free-internally
constrained" ( EF/IC).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-016#27:1>
The EC/IF model may be illustrated by the North American experience
and the EF/IC model by the Chinese immigrants in the early Straits
Settlements.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-016#28:1>
That Chinese immigrants in the early Straits Settlements were dialect
bound is well documented.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-016#29:1>
The effects of this binding permeated not only into residential
settlements and social organization, but also occupational structure.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-016#30:1>
A number of early observations associated some trades and occupations
with certain dialect groups.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-016#31:1>
An ecological perspective stressing the role of secret organizations
has been offered to account for such a relationship between contract
labourers and their types of job.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-016#32:1>
But, Yen suggests clan ties, or its extended territorial connections,
as an explanatory factor.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-016#33:1>
This suggestion is plausible, insofar as the level of gener-
alisation is confined to only voluntary/freed contract labourers.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-016#34:1>
One has yet to be convinced as to how hundreds of thousands of
workers could congregate to work in deserted areas like tin mining sites and
plantations of various kinds if formal organization of labourers was
inefficient.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-016#35:1>
It certainly makes sense to see these workers as bonded through their
dialect origins, but clan network may be more readily employed in explaining
the occupation-dialect group affinity of the voluntary immigrants and the
freed contract labourers.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-016#36:1>
And yet this occupational snowballing effect operated primarily on
the later immigrants, and the occupational choice of the first immigrants was
believed to be a historical accident.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-016#37:1>
Shortly, we shall present some observations on such an occupational
pattern.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-016#38:1>
<h> Source of Data </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-016#39:1>
Information on trades and occupations of the Chinese in the Straits
Settlements is available from both direct and indirect sources.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-016#40:1>
The former includes Census of Population reports and, to some extent
literature on occupational guilds and news reports in the Chinese newspapers,
while the latter consists of inscriptional data and documented observations
made by contemporary local residents.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-016#41:1>
The first-scientific census of population in the Straits Settlements
was conducted In 1871; thence there was one almost every decade.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-016#42:1>
Unfortunately, occupational category for that issue was only
subclassified according to three ethnic types, namely, Europeans, Eurasians,
and Natives.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-016#43:1>
The 1891 and 1901 censuses removed the occupation entry, because the
return of occupation was said to be of little value owing to " the constant
changes of occupation that occur among the Native Population, especially
among the Chinese".

<ICE-SIN:W2A-016#44:1>
The category on occupation was resumed in 1911, but was then
subclassified according to sex, and was geographically confined to Penang,
Malacca, and Singapore.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-016#45:1>
The three censuses that contain some information about the Chinese
and their occupations were those taken in 1881, 1921, and 1931.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-016#46:1>
Remarks by the Superintendent of Census on the association between
Chinese dialect groups and their occupations are available in the latter two
reports.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-016#47:1>
The formation of Chinese occupational guilds provides another direct
source useful in delineating the broader categories of trade among the
dialect groups.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-016#48:1>
The information is contained mainly in Wu Hua's Handbook on Chinese
Occupational Guilds.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-016#49:1>
Two Chinese newspapers, namely, Lat Pao and Thiam Nam Shian Pao,
which were circulated in Singapore in the late 1890s, customarily reported
the occupational status of people in the news.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-016#50:1>
Contemporary residents living in the Settlements also made remarks on
the relationship between type of occupations and Chinese dialect groups.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-016#51:1>
Yet another important source for the topic can be found in
inscriptional data which were released intermittently between 1972 and 1987.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-016#52:1>
The construction of occupationdialect group relationships from the
epigraphic materials entailed a series of steps, beginning with a thorough
scrutiny of the tens of thousands of inscribed names of donors that appeared
in the temples, huiguans, burial grounds, and such like, founded between the
1700s and 1941.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-016#53:1>
Next, general names that are supposedly related to any trade/
occupation with unambiguous nature were processed.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-016#54:1>
These names which indicate a definite kind of trade or occupation
include the following: dang ( pawnbroking}, lou ( restaurant), tang ( Chinese
herbal medical store), yao ( quarrying,lbrickworking), guan/xuan ( tea/coffee
or beverage shop) chuang ( tailoring/clothing), banchang ( saw-mill), and
chuan/zhou ( shipping).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-016#55:1>
In processing the occupational data, the dialect origins of the
shops/shopowners had first to be established, prior to assigning a particular
occupation to a dialect group.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-016#56:1>
This has been done elsewhere.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-016#57:1>
We then excluded shopnames that are associated with any businesses
that are considered to be of an integrative nature i.e., those that show no
dialect distinctiveness for they do not fulfill our present purpose.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-016#58:1>
Because of the nature of the data given for the analysis, the concept
of dialect groups is too embracing to be able to take care of internal
segmentations.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-016#59:1>
What complicates the issue further are situations where some dialect
groups' structural and organizational characteristics did not always match in
the early days.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-016#60:1>
For example, although structurally the peranakans or babas were
assigned a specific category known as " Straits Born Chinese" in some issues
of the Census of Population, they were treated as Minan people in the
analysis for two important reasons.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-016#61:1>
Traditionally, most babas were of Minan origins.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-016#62:1>
Socially, the babas in the early times were very much involved in the
affairs of the Chinese, especially the Hokkien community.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-016#63:1>
They held offices in some of the more prominent subcommunal
organisations; this is indicated in several minutes of the management
committee meetings of the Malacca Cheng Hoon Teng, and also in inscriptional
data.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-016#64:1>
The range of coverage of the Census category for Hokkiens was not
well defined.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-016#65:1>
lt is however rather clear that people from Xinghua, Fuqing and
Fuzhou were not included.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-016#66:1>
This exclusion suggests that Southern Hokkiens or Minan people may
have been composed primarily of people from Zhangzhou, Quanzhou, and
Yongchun.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-016#67:1>
Dialect Group and Occupation Table 1 which is extracted from various
sources shows the relationship between dialect group and trade/occupation for
forty occupations and six dialect groups.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-016#68:1>
The list of occupations is by no means exhaustive.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-016#69:1>
It is unnecessary to be so, for as it is, it suffices to suggest the
existence of a relationship between dialect group and occupation among the
early Chinese immigrants in Singapore.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-016#70:1>
As can be seen from Table 1, businesses related to commerce,
international trading, finance, and manufacturing were closely associated
with the Hokkiens ( mainly Southern Hokkiens), whereas the Hakkas and
Cantonese were mainly engaged in traditional occupations such as carpentry,
smiting, and herbal medicine.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-016#71:1>
The Hainanese were mostly attracted to service-oriented occupations.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-016#72:1>
A very distinct cluster of transportation-related occupations were
dominated by the Henghwa ( Xinghua) and Hokchia ( Fuqing) people.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-016#73:1>
The Teochius were more inclined towards primary production
occupations such as planting, poultry rearing, and fishing.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-016#74:1>
While there were Cantonese boat-builders, Hokchia seamen, Hokkien
longshoremen, and Teochiu fishermen, the Hakkas did not seem to like work in
or near the sea.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-016#75:1>
Remarks given by the Superintendent responsible for both the 1921 and
1931 censuses, contained in Table 2, confirm the information given in Table
1, except that the former's coverage extended beyond Singapore to the Malay
Peninsula.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-016#76:1>
Table 2 confirms that the Hokkiens were extensively engaged in
farming, trading, and common shopkeeping, while the other dialect groups were
active in occupations not featured in Table 1.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-016#77:1>
Amongst the planters, the Hakkas specialized in cultivating cloves,
nutmegs, and, later, rubber in confined areas such as Balik Pulau in Penang
and Bukit Mertajam in Province Wellesley.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-016#78:1>
On the other hand, a large number of Hainanese had also worked in
rubber plantations in some rural areas in Malacca, Negri Sembilan, and
Johore.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-016#79:1>
Working in a rubber plantation was never a special occupational
feature of any particular dialect group, except for its ecological
significance indicating the residential settlement of the group.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-016#80:1>
The Hainanese were noted for their occupational competence in
housekeeping, embracing services/skills in hotel keeping, Western cuisines,
and beverage preparation.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-016#81:1>
As domestic servants, they serve mostly European households and
establishments.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-016#82:1>
The movement of these employers therefore determined the trend of
this Hainanese occupation.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-016#83:1>
Exodus of the Europeans and their families, foreshadowing the decline
of the Hainanese role in domestic services, took place only when Malaya and
Singapore became independent

<ICE-SIN:W2A-016#84:1>
Since most European families lived in town areas instead of the then
vastly uncultivated rural districts, most Hainanese were urban residents.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-016#85:1>
Remarks made by the Superintendent of Census that most prostitutes
were of Cantonese origin are in effect only a re-confirmation of an earlier
report in newspapers of that period.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-016#86:1>
It was reported that in Singapore's Kreta Ayer area alone there were,
in the late nineteenth century, already a few thousand prostitutes.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-016#87:1>
Presumably they were Cantonese, because the residents there were
predominantly of this dialect group.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-016#88:1>
This stereotyping was also echoed 1950s in Muar, Johore in a
cross-dialect group reference. <X>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-016#X89:1>
The reference goes as follows: " The Teochius were reputed for their
kuayteow, Hokkiens their mee; Hainanese for their coffee, and the Cantonese
for their pee".

<ICE-SIN:W2A-016#X90:1>
Kuayteow is a special kind of rice noodle, and pee which is rhymed
with mee, is phonetical slang for a lady's private parts.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-016#X91:1>
The Hokchia and Hokchiu ( Fuzhou) people were demographically
insignificant minorities, whose main occupations in the early days were in
transport-related works such as rickshaw pulling and bus driving.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-016#X92:1>
Doubtlessly, they were urbanites.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-016#X93:1>
Dialect Group, Occupation and Location What has thus been revealed
is that there is an occupational pattern formed along the lines of dialect
origin, with reference to very specific locational distribution.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-016#X94:1>
Data are available for such a relationship to be juxtaposed against
the following locations: Malacca, Penang, Singapore, Matang, Taiping, Teluk
Anson, and Ipoh.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-016#X95:1>
The occupations/businesses to be referred to are mostly traditional
and include pawnbroking, restaurant, Chinese medicine, shipping, bookstore,
quarrying/brickmaking, tea/coffee shop, tailoring, and sawmill.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-016#X96:1>
It can be seen from Table 3 that the particular dialect groups
tended to operate sawmills ( the Cantonese in Taiping), and bookshops ( the
Hakkas in Penang), and predominate in the shipping industry ( the Hokkiens in
Singapore).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-016#X97:1>
While information on Cantonese/sawmill and Hakkas/bookshop is new,
that on Hokkien/shipping is a reconfirmation of the data in Table 1.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-016#X98:1>
Since the Hokkiens had been extensively engaged in the import and
export business in Singapore, which was an important port in the region
during the nineteenth century, it is therefore of no surprise to find that
they were also in the shipping venture.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-016#X99:1>
As indicated in Table 3, certain dialect groups practised a
particular kind of trade in ( or not in) a particular location.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-016#X100:1>
Below we shall go through some of those occupations.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-016#X101:1>
Pawnbroking: The pawnbrokers during the period 1795 to 1910
included Hakkas, Hokkiens, Cantonese, and the category of either Cantonese or
Hakkas at different locations.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-016#X102:1>
The case of the Hokkiens being involved in pawnbroking requires
some explanation.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-016#X103:1>
There were two temples which received donations from the five
pawnbroking shops in British Malaya.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-016#X104:1>
The temples were in fact integrative by nature, and hence, the
dialect origins of the donors were assigned on the basis of demographic
dominance.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-016#X105:1>
During 1881 and 1911, the census indicated that the population of
the Hokkien and Straitsborn Chinese in Malacca were over 50 per cent of the
total contemporary Chinese population.'

<ICE-SIN:W2A-016#X106:1>
The occupation-dialect group affinity may also be expressed in
terms of location.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-016#X107:1>
The Hakkas who operated a few pawnshops in Malacca were then only
the second largest minority goup there, making up 12 per cent of the town's
population.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-016#X108:1>
Demographic dominance thus did not seem to have exerted much effect
on occupation-dialect group affinity for all types of occupation.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-016#X109:1>
Restaurant: The location effect also applied to the restaurant
business.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-016#X110:1>
While there were only six Hokkien-operated restaurants ( i.e.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-016#X111:1>
restaurants whose operators had donated to Hokkien voluntary
associations) in Malacca in 1795, a total of 263 Cantonese and/or Hakka
restaurant proprietors had their businesses in Singapore rather than in
Malacca.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-016#X112:1>
From the large number of restaurants owned by the Cantonese, it is
almost certain that the Cantonese had an edge in the business over other
dialect groups.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-016#X113:1>
Herbal Medical Store: The Hainanese had only a few Chinese drug
stores in Malacca, Penang, and Singapore.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-016#X114:1>
The Hokkiens were comparatively keener than the Hainanese in the
trade which extended beyond the three Straits Settlements to Matang/Taiping
and Teluk Anson.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-016#X115:1>
The Cantonese in Malacca during 1880-1909 were not found to be
interested in the Chinese medicine business, but their counterparts in
Singapore opened 117 such stores there.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-016#X116:1>
The Hakkas appear to have been less interested in the trade,
judging by the confirmed cases shown in Table 3.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-016#X117:1>
Their interest would appear to be stronger, if half the cases
included in the category " Cantonese and/or Hakkas" are assigned to them.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-016#X118:1>
Tea/Coffee Shops: The Hainanese have usually been associated with
the coffee shop business.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-016#X119:1>
The Hainanese in Penang in the 1870s contributed to such a
stereotype, but this was not so in other locations.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-016#X120:1>
In inscriptional data, there was no evidence that the Hainanese
operated any restaurant which in some cases could have functioned as a coffee
shop.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-016#X121:1>
Their extensive involvement in domestic services in the early days
had perhaps kept them fully occupied.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-016#X122:1>
The high proportion of European residents in both Singapore and
Malacca created such a high demand for domestic servants that the Hainanese
were not inclined to enter the coffee shop business in the two locations
around 1870.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-016#X123:1>
Tailoring/Clothing: The Hainanese were more active in the tailoring
business in the 1870s in Penang.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-016#X124:1>
The Cantonese and/or Hakkas were also involved in this type of work
around the same time.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-016#X125:1>
No shop belonging to any of these three dialect groups have been
found in either Singapore or Malacca Inscriptions.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-016#X126:1>
Brickmaking.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-016#X127:1>
The Cantonese and Hakkas were found to have engaged in brickmaking
in Singapore in 1855 ( Table 1).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-016#X128:1>
Twenty-five years later in 1880, the Cantonese were still in the
trade ( Table 3).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-016#X129:1>
They had seven brick quarries in Singapore.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-016#X130:1>
The Hokkiens in Singapore, however, showed no interest in the
business at all.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-016#X131:1>
But their counterparts in Ipoh had set up one brick quarry there
around 1898. </X> </I>
