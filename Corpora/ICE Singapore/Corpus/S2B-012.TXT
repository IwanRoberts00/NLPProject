And now we bring you reports on this evening's campaigning
for the general election

<ICE-SIN:S2B-012#106:1:A>
Four parties are now holding rallies

<ICE-SIN:S2B-012#107:1:A>
The PAP is holding a rally instead of a dialogue session this
evening at Eunos GRC

<ICE-SIN:S2B-012#108:1:A>
The Workers Party is holding two rallies one in Hougang and the
other in Bedok GRC

<ICE-SIN:S2B-012#109:1:A>
The Singapore Democratic Party is campaigning in Braddell Heights
and Nee Soon Central and the PKMS in Ayer Rajah

<ICE-SIN:S2B-012#110:1:A>
At a Workers' Party in Hougang Dr Lee Siew Choh its candidate for
Eunos GRC said there's no democracy in Singapore

<ICE-SIN:S2B-012#111:1:A>
When you talk about democracy you would allow people to hold small
meetings together discuss political issues of the day so that you know they
can exchange views and maybe make suggestions to the government but in
Singapore you are not allowed to do that

<ICE-SIN:S2B-012#112:1:A>
If you speak up and you speak up against the government they may
take action against you

<ICE-SIN:S2B-012#113:1:A>
Therefore it becomes very difficult for people to gather to talk
about things

<ICE-SIN:S2B-012#114:1:A>
Many people have a lot of views they discuss it behind the scene

<ICE-SIN:S2B-012#115:1:A>
They talk it in their rooms in their family circle between friends
in club maybe

<ICE-SIN:S2B-012#116:1:A>
But if you were to ask them to come out openly and identify
themselves with the opposition they have to say they dare not

<ICE-SIN:S2B-012#117:1:A>
Therefore in Singapore today there is an atmosphere of fear and
this atmosphere of fear we must try and get rid of

<ICE-SIN:S2B-012#118:1:A>
Everybody must help to get rid of this fear

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S2B-012#119:1:B>
At the SDP rally its candidate for Braddell Heights said the
PAP has been lucky so far

<ICE-SIN:S2B-012#120:1:B>
In nineteen sixty three the PAP dominant dominating the whole of
the political environment of Singapore

<ICE-SIN:S2B-012#121:1:B>
Now there are such reason there there were reason for that where
we know we understand because at that time it's a turbulent world

<ICE-SIN:S2B-012#122:1:B>
Not only that Singapore is in trouble where poverty unemployment
but the whole world is such

<ICE-SIN:S2B-012#123:1:B>
You look and recall in nineteen sixty in India in China they are
not as good as today

<ICE-SIN:S2B-012#124:1:B>
So the whole world has progressed progressed over the thirty years

<ICE-SIN:S2B-012#125:1:B>
So the PAP they are in a way very lucky that they are in power for
the last thirty years and when they talk about the achievement of today in
Singapore they said this is achievement by us by PAP not by you

<ICE-SIN:S2B-012#126:1:B>
I think that is absolutely wrong

<ICE-SIN:S2B-012#127:1:B>
Without the support without the hardworking of the people no
government can success

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S2B-012#128:1:B>
Speaking later the same rally the party Secretary-General Mr
Chiam See Tong says it is wrong to believe that the opposition does not
support the good efforts of the PAP

<ICE-SIN:S2B-012#129:1:B>
The PAP has always try to make it a bad picture of the opposition
<X>

<ICE-SIN:S2B-012#X130:1:B>
They want to always make it as if the opposition wants to stop
progress It is absolutely not true We are Singaporeans We are in the
opposition Why? Because we are concerned for our country Therefore it is
wrong to say that we want to hold back progress It's absolutely not true In
fact if the government does good things we will say yes please do more for
the people We should not say because it is done by PAP no no no good we don't
want If the PAP wants to build hospital here we said okay please go ahead
build one more We don't mind if they get the name for it because it's good
for Singapore It does not mean that because it is done by the PAP we say it's
bad We are constructive we are supportive of all good cause and in fact it is
our duty to make sure the PAP do only good for Singapore

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S2B-012#X131:1:B>
The Singapore Malay National Organisation PKMS held their
first rally this evening in Ayer Rajah Candidates touched on the racial
harmony the rising cost of living and criticise the Next Lap Its candidate
for Jurong Mr <unclear> word </unclear> said the publication did not have
what he called soul It's in the Next Lap You must <unclear> word </unclear>
scrutinise it and understand it then you will see some thing emerging a
monster and a Frankenstein So that is why we demand that uh if the PAP are
sincere we demand to know who are the office of the Next Lap and we demand to
know what books of references they referred to when they compile this book
and we demand to know the sources of that knowledge Name your books the PAP
name your books of reference and you will be rest assured that we dare probe
into the sources of their knowledge but with the caution of our soul

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S2B-012#X132:1:A>
At the PAP rally in Eunos the Prime Minister Mr Goh Chok
Tong took to task the Workers' Party Mr Jufrie Mahmood for mixing religion
with politics He said Mr Jufrie's been making communal and religious
insinuations and <unclear> word </unclear> definitely agitating the Malay
ground by speaking only in Malay in the hope that Chinese voters won't know
what he's saying Mr Goh cited several instances when this was done At
Workers' Party rally last week Mr Jufrie accused his PAP opponent Mr Sidek
Saniff of selling out the Malays and of attempts to buy the Malays Mr Goh
said in the last election Mr Jufrie also attacked PAP Malay MPs repeatedly
for taking a moderate line and working in co-operation with the PAP
government to improve the lot of the Malays instead of taking a
confrontational stance I'm happy that Jufrie has come up openly with his
position Yes Sidek Saniff supported the tertiary scheme proposal He was in
the forefront persuading Malays those Malays who can afford it to give up the
privilege of free university education he wants them to pay and he wants the
money to be given to Mendaki to help the poorer Malays and this policy is not
Sidek's policy It is my policy I suggested it Our policy is right because our
policy is aimed at making the Malays help themselves so that they can compete
with the Chinese and Indians and at the end of the road they can do well and
they can claim that it is through their own merit and ability that they are
able to stand tall Now as for separation of religion and politics Sidek
Saniff believes that politics and religion must not mix It is too potent a
mixture if you mix politics with Islam you allow Buddhism to be mixed with
politics you mix politics with Christianity then that spells for trouble So
he's speaking out of his heart when he supports the separation of politics
from religion But Jufrie says that is wrong he wants to mix religion with
politics Well you try and do that in Singapore you are going to end up with a
big fire right away Just look at India look at Sri Lanka where politics are
mixed with religion What has happened in India what has happened in Sri Lanka
will happen very quickly in Singapore if we mix religion with politics
January nineteen eighty-five I was appointed Deputy Prime Minister You can
trace the record between nineteen eight-five and now to see what we have done
to fulfill a promise in that document <unclear> word </unclear> nineteen
ninety-nine MRT we've got it today Indoor Stadium we said we we would build
it we have built it Town councils we have got them HDB refurbishing on the
way Pilot projects are now being done in six areas So that program is on the
way Mendaki formed Mendaki one Mendaki two I said we should form a special
committee to help the Malays Mendaki two has been formed and now we are going
in for Sinda to help the Indians And after we have helped the lower income
Indians after we have formed Sinda we are going to form a development
assistance committee for the Chinese There are also poor Chinese don't think
all Chinese are rich In fact there are more poor Chinese than poor Malays and
Indians put together So we will focus our attention to help the lower income
Chinese If I succeed in forcing a bond with you I meet you at dialogue
sessions once in two weeks after election I go down I give the meet the
people face to face there is no need for opposition and if PAP leaders become
arrogant please give us a knock on the head No it it is possible that
sometimes ideas get to get into our head if there are very few opposition
members in parliament it is possible that we become complacent we become a
little swell-headed I say it is possible for myself I don't think that is
possible I cannot change but assuming that it is possible you will be our
safeguard you will be the people who will check us The PAP the government are
now big enough to accommodate a range of views In our early days we would not
tolerate dissenting viewpoints we were like a samphan and we believe like a
samphan you cannot allow people to tussle to quarrel on a samphan because the
samphan will capsize but today I believe we are more like a big boat the
bottom is flatter it is very flatter very like a ferry you see like a ferry
correct like a ferry Thank you That's what I meant by participation of the
people I did not have the right word or the right metaphor but the idea grew
forth ferry Yes on a ferry we can we can accommodate a range of opinions and
I have allowed encouraged people to air their opinions Now you read the
Straits Times You read SBC you watch SBC People now criticise the government
they come up with alternative ideas Opposition are free to criticise us I
said go ahead so long as we know that certina areas are off limit like
language religion race so long as we keep away from these areas it is alright
You can criticise my program you can criticise my style you can offer a
better style a better program I accept And if ideas are good I co-opt them
Again which is why the opposition has not come up with any ideas First I
think they are incapable of coming up with ideas and if they have to help us
to govern you know what I will do I will co-opt their ideas So in parliament
if in parliament or outside they do come up with an idea to help me govern
Singapore better I will say thank you very much Mr Chiam I'm going to
implement it and if I do that my government will become better say My
government becomes better by nineteen ninety-six there'll be no chance for
Mr Chiam
