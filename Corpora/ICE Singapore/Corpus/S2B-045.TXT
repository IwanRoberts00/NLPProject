I'm going to use what Kirpal Singh used yesterday and
unfortunately he's not here to see this to hear this

<ICE-SIN:S2B-045#2:1:A>
He's a friend and and an old classmate

<ICE-SIN:S2B-045#3:1:A>
I'm I'm going to use this thing if ever it exists called a
publisher's licence

<ICE-SIN:S2B-045#4:1:A>
Which was what Kirpal Singh used yesterday when he referred
everything to poetic licence

<ICE-SIN:S2B-045#5:1:A>
Uhm I have the unadulterated unqualified luxury this morning of
making a vote as a publisher on whether you know you could produce a book of
standard Singapore English as a dictionary

<ICE-SIN:S2B-045#6:1:A>
Ah and without uh having to ask whether you would like to find exit
or not or whether you would like to work as part of it

<ICE-SIN:S2B-045#7:1:A>
But first of all my vote and then what I'd like to do is after I've
told you what I ah how we feel as a house in respect of uhm the existence of
us a dictionary of standard Singapore English

<ICE-SIN:S2B-045#8:1:A>
I'd like very much uhm to consider its usage

<ICE-SIN:S2B-045#9:1:A>
How it would be done

<ICE-SIN:S2B-045#10:1:A>
How it could contribute or not contribute to I think it would
contribute to the development of fiction Singapore fiction Singapore creative
writing and in a wider scope South-East Asian writing

<ICE-SIN:S2B-045#11:1:A>
Which is the field that we are particularly interested in

<ICE-SIN:S2B-045#12:1:A>
And how it would uhm uh play its role in the creativity and the
originality as a development of such writing

<ICE-SIN:S2B-045#13:1:A>
And eventually whether it would assist this kind of writing

<ICE-SIN:S2B-045#14:1:A>
Travel it's over and good to say that I would like to use a word
shiok but it's not much good if your word shiok is not as understood as the
word

<ICE-SIN:S2B-045#15:1:A>
In Jewish writing uh you know I think you would all of us who want
to write or who are publishers writing

<ICE-SIN:S2B-045#16:1:A>
One type of writing to export and to travel

<ICE-SIN:S2B-045#17:1:A>
Can you hear me at the back

<ICE-SIN:S2B-045#18:1:A>
And then finally what I would like to say is I'd like to say I'd
like to postulate and uhm if I can within the 10 minutes Susan has allocated
uh I ask you if you feel that this notion of Singapore writing can itself in
itself take its place amongst some very large movements of writing that has
hit that has its it's absorbing the minds of English language uhm publishing
and English language writing in in the western world particularly in English
language writing in America and in English language writing in UK and
continental Europe and in Australia and New Zealand

<ICE-SIN:S2B-045#19:1:A>
But first my vote and of course we would like to see the existence
of a dictionary of Singapore English

<ICE-SIN:S2B-045#20:1:A>
Secondly what we would particularly interested in is the fact that
it would act if it were produced in the same original size of the Marquarie
dictionary as a standard or a touchstone

<ICE-SIN:S2B-045#21:1:A>
And a comparative one we hope against British English and American
English

<ICE-SIN:S2B-045#22:1:A>
And oh what I would like to see is but it would act as a touchstone
for us uh uh a basis of comparison uhm a use of measure

<ICE-SIN:S2B-045#23:1:A>
And in many ways if a kind of standard or or albeit whether it has
to be updated or not of how English has been used in this region

<ICE-SIN:S2B-045#24:1:A>
And I wouldn't entirely like to confine that to Singapore because a
large amount of the writing as some of the researches have noted have come
from Malaysia and South-East Asia in the region

<ICE-SIN:S2B-045#25:1:A>
In particular in English language writing or English language
translations of Dutch or Indonesian writing in the early days

<ICE-SIN:S2B-045#26:1:A>
But I think an unqualified yes because we would like to see for
example its etymology as Simon so rightly pointed out

<ICE-SIN:S2B-045#27:1:A>
And we'd like very much for it to be part and parcel of the
cultural identity and something that is absorbing the minds of many people in
the government

<ICE-SIN:S2B-045#28:1:A>
But this dictionary we feel uh would contribute in great extent to
that identity and uhm that notion of what kind of what I'm a Singaporean but
what is a Singaporean

<ICE-SIN:S2B-045#29:1:A>
And we feel that that would go a long way towards contributing to
that in the development of fiction writing in Singapore would the last ten or
fifteen years

<ICE-SIN:S2B-045#30:1:A>
Early English language writing began with the British

<ICE-SIN:S2B-045#31:1:A>
Of course you know and with a large amount of their impressions
their nostalgia their their feelings about uh South-East Asia the Chinese and
the Singaporeans here now though in the last eight or ten years

<ICE-SIN:S2B-045#32:1:A>
We ourselves you know in the pursuit of Singapore writing and
South-east Asian writing have been publishing

<ICE-SIN:S2B-045#33:1:A>
And we have within our editorial ru uhm room will tell have had
great disagreements about what we can publish what we will publish what we
can and will not accept

<ICE-SIN:S2B-045#34:1:A>
And we've uh we have ourselves seen us change our points of view
haven't we

<ICE-SIN:S2B-045#35:1:A>
Our opinions on the use of

<ICE-SIN:S2B-045#36:1:A>
Uhm what I've learnt yesterday was called a borrowing and I'm all
for the usage of borrowing

<ICE-SIN:S2B-045#37:1:A>
Uhm we have borrowed from Malay and Chinese

<ICE-SIN:S2B-045#38:1:A>
What I'd loved to see is to see us borrow from the Dutch to a great
extent like a word like or even from Mandarin

<ICE-SIN:S2B-045#39:1:A>
Which uhm which I think in the longer run would be a language that
would give you a uh greater amount of degree of sensibility and uhm and and
sensuousness and a greater length of poetic language that you can use

<ICE-SIN:S2B-045#40:1:A>
Uhm much more than say Malay

<ICE-SIN:S2B-045#41:1:A>
Could you know down the road but I think a a dictionary if produced
would lend itself and uhm would be a useful tool and a useful touchstone in
that particular area

<ICE-SIN:S2B-045#42:1:A>
The next question really to ask ourselves is uh whether words like
or words like sayang which was used yesterday uh would enter in the English
language

<ICE-SIN:S2B-045#43:1:A>
The way a word like serendipid uh serendipity does uh we're hoping
that would happen

<ICE-SIN:S2B-045#44:1:A>
But down the road if that is to happen uh your book your story your
fiction your writing your Singapore writing has to travel has to export uhm

<ICE-SIN:S2B-045#45:1:A>
It has to would be exported and be backed by either a publisher or
a house or an institution in in the national market that is not our own

<ICE-SIN:S2B-045#46:1:A>
I'm not sure if that would work at the moment

<ICE-SIN:S2B-045#47:1:A>
I uhm I see some positive signs although I think it would be
gradual and it will grow in concentric circles from the region

<ICE-SIN:S2B-045#48:1:A>
But I hope that Singapore would be the nucleus of this sort of of
idea

<ICE-SIN:S2B-045#49:1:A>
Finally the important thing to think to think about is uhm
Singapore writing using standard Singapore English

<ICE-SIN:S2B-045#50:1:A>
Whether it would be whether we would could consider that down the
road it could be a corpus

<ICE-SIN:S2B-045#51:1:A>
I'm not immediately now but could it the kind of corpus that
African writing is the Jewish writing is in America or indeed that overseas
American born Chinese writing is grabbing America

<ICE-SIN:S2B-045#52:1:A>
Now I think those were the issues uhm that I would consider and
within me and us in particular uhm as a fiction house </I>

<ICE-SIN:S2B-045#53:2:B>
Now thank you Anne

<ICE-SIN:S2B-045#54:2:B>
I think that you know when the time comes to organise WICC2 uh you
may consider an additional question to the list of things to ponder and I
would like to suggest this question

<ICE-SIN:S2B-045#55:2:B>
Do you want the anti-climax of a standard closing address at the
end of the workshop

<ICE-SIN:S2B-045#56:2:B>
And if the answer is a resounding no I think it will come as a
great relief to me

<ICE-SIN:S2B-045#57:2:B>
<O> laughs </O>

<ICE-SIN:S2B-045#58:2:B>
But since I have uh receive your marching orders so to speak I
shall have to press on somehow uh in my Singaporean fashion

<ICE-SIN:S2B-045#59:2:B>
Now ladies and gentlemen you may recall that at the opening of this
workshop uh Dr Ban Kah Choon began by referring to the movie The Terminator
and its science fiction terminology

<ICE-SIN:S2B-045#60:2:B>
Well now at this final session I find myself playing terminator to
this workshop

<ICE-SIN:S2B-045#61:2:B>
Perhaps I should say Terminator 2 since I'm only a stand-in for the
Director A/P Ong Jin Hui who is uh presently out of town

<ICE-SIN:S2B-045#62:2:B>
Which explains why a political scientist has been called upon to
make the closing speech at a workshop on lexicography

<ICE-SIN:S2B-045#63:2:B>
Well the day before the start to this workshop I was actually on
the Borneo side now of the South China Sea Basin coordinating

<ICE-SIN:S2B-045#64:2:B>
Or rather helping to wind down a workshop on regional security in
the post cold war concept

<ICE-SIN:S2B-045#65:2:B>
It seemed to me at the time that a lexicography workshop couldn't
have been more distant from our preoccupation with great power politics

<ICE-SIN:S2B-045#66:2:B>
But having sat through some very interesting and fascinating
sessions of this workshop I must say that I have learned a lot uh from the
remarkable similarity between the underlying issues

<ICE-SIN:S2B-045#67:2:B>
And uh I am beginning to hope that more of my colleagues in
Political Science could have been here

<ICE-SIN:S2B-045#68:2:B>
At one level we at this workshop have been reflecting on the
fragmentation of empire

<ICE-SIN:S2B-045#69:2:B>
In this case the fragmentation of the language of an empire

<ICE-SIN:S2B-045#70:2:B>
Without making it too explicit we have touched on the international
phenomenon of pluralization and the drift towards regionalization and
multiplurality

<ICE-SIN:S2B-045#71:2:B>
There is also an unmistakable ideological dimension to the
ostensibly simple question of whether there ought to be a dictionary of
Singapore English

<ICE-SIN:S2B-045#72:2:B>
The rhetoric of those who forcibly argue for a change in the ground
rules

<ICE-SIN:S2B-045#73:2:B>
Whether ground rules governing the selection of words for inclusion
or the ground rules of right pronunciation

<ICE-SIN:S2B-045#74:2:B>
All that rhetoric is reminiscent of the rhetoric of the North-South
debate

<ICE-SIN:S2B-045#75:2:B>
And having listened to the comment by Dr this morning I am
intrigued to compare the fate of English with other international languages

<ICE-SIN:S2B-045#76:2:B>
Do other empires strike back to rebind the language that is
increasingly regionalized

<ICE-SIN:S2B-045#77:2:B>
I wonder what would have happened if the French rather than the
British were the colonisers of Singapore

<ICE-SIN:S2B-045#78:2:B>
Will we now be renovating in style our dominant language the way
the Vietnamese are renovating their economy

<ICE-SIN:S2B-045#79:2:B>
A point was made that eight years ago a project such as this would
have been quite unthinkable

<ICE-SIN:S2B-045#80:2:B>
Yet others have observed that this effort at corpora building
reflects an aspect of national assertiveness greater confidence

<ICE-SIN:S2B-045#81:2:B>
Maybe national identification maybe even a growth uh of a
middle-class while agreeing that ideology should not stand in the way of
progress

<ICE-SIN:S2B-045#82:2:B>
I think we should nevertheless be conscious that many of the
questions that revolve around the central issue of a dictionary of standard
Singapore English has political implications or connotations

<ICE-SIN:S2B-045#83:2:B>
Why should we have such a dictionary in the first place

<ICE-SIN:S2B-045#84:2:B>
Perhaps that question has already been overtaken uh by the events
of this very workshop

<ICE-SIN:S2B-045#85:2:B>
But then we shall have to ask who should have a hand in deciding
what should be included

<ICE-SIN:S2B-045#86:2:B>
What is such a dictionary intending to serve

<ICE-SIN:S2B-045#87:2:B>
Is it to be simply a record of regional English within a particular
multi-cultural setting at a particular period of time

<ICE-SIN:S2B-045#88:2:B>
The kind of zoo or supermarket situation that we were reflecting
about

<ICE-SIN:S2B-045#89:2:B>
Or is it to be the final arbiter of what is acceptable Singapore
English

<ICE-SIN:S2B-045#90:2:B>
Here in lies the issues of official status respectability and
legitimacy things that political scientists are very fond of talking about

<ICE-SIN:S2B-045#91:2:B>
Then again we can ask what other implications of such an enterprise
for those in other disciplines who have the great essays written in English
to be sure

<ICE-SIN:S2B-045#92:2:B>
Ideology must not stand in the way of progress but I am also
reminded that those who cannot read the writing on the wall must pay for
their political illiteracy

<ICE-SIN:S2B-045#93:2:B>
Whichever way we go from here the fact remains that there is a wide
spectum of interests in the subject of this workshop

<ICE-SIN:S2B-045#94:2:B>
And this is clearly indicated by the very strong representation of
the government sector

<ICE-SIN:S2B-045#95:2:B>
In particular the Ministry of Education the private publishing
sector our sister institutions of higher learning NTU NIE RELC Ngee Ann Poly
and so forth <X>

<ICE-SIN:S2B-045#X96:2:B>
And also of course that bastion or outpost depending on how you
look at it of English the British Council of course one can say that this is
the kind of subject that everyone in the Arts and Social Sciences and beyond
should be interested in language afterall is the indispensable currency of
social interaction but it takes a specialist and a particular kind of
specialist to tell us how to structure dictionary entries for discourse
particles like what and lah and lor and nei and in the course of an afternoon
we were also exposed to transitivity structures we considered mood adjuncts
and delve into the meaning of finite verbal operators side by side by other
exotica like theme rheme and mood residue fortunately we were told though in
a quite different context don't be concerned by the complicated appearnace of
these terms however simple words can also be rendered ambiguous by the social
cultural context I think and this can be particularly maddening in the
language of intra-ASEAN diplomacy a colleague of mine who was here this
morning but uh who is no longer here is fond of recounting a recet incident
in which the Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir attempted to solicited to
solicit support for his EastAsia Economic Group idea from President Suharto
the reply from the Indonesian President I will look into it which in the
Javanese cultural context was as good as saying no perhaps we can reflect on
this kind of cross-cultural perception in our next dictionary of ASEAN
English but whether we go on to bigger things or settle for a dictionary of
standard Singapore English or one covering Malaysian-Singapore English the
important thing is that with this workshop we have at least taken a tentative
first step and here I am pleased that the CAS has in some very modest way
been able to support a very useful project I should also uh acknowledge in
this connection the financial contribution given by John Wiley & Sons I would
like to thank Susan Butler for sharing her Marquarie experiences with uh with
us and for her very active contributions uh to the department of English
language & literature special thanks uh for its consistent and strong support
and also of course I should acknowledge the untiring work uh of our
co-ordinator Anne Pakir I think after this workshop she should at least have
the confidence that when she goes back to the CAS for furhter support and we
say we will look into it she needs only interprst that in the Singapore
cultural context thank you ladies and gentlemen </X> </I>
