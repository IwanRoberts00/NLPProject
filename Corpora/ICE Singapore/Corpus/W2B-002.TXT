<h> WAYS OF THE LAW - THE MAINTENANCE ISSUE </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-002#8:1>
Any married woman, whether Muslim or non-Muslim, is entitled to apply
under the Women's Charter for reasonable maintenance from her husband for
herself and their children.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-002#9:1>
Children include any illegitimate children and any children who have
been accepted by him as a member of the family.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-002#10:1>
A maintenance order may be made before, during and after a divorce.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-002#11:1>
The Court may order the husband to pay a lump sum or make a monthly
allowance as maintenance.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-002#12:1>
The Court will take the following circumstances into account when
making a maintenance order:

<ICE-SIN:W2B-002#13:1>
1) the financial needs of the wife or child/children;

<ICE-SIN:W2B-002#14:1>
2) the income earning capacity, if any, property and other financial
resources of the wife or child;

<ICE-SIN:W2B-002#15:1>
3) any physical or mental disability of the wife or child; and

<ICE-SIN:W2B-002#16:1>
4) the standard of living enjoyed by the wife before the
husband/father neglected or refused to provide reasonable maintenance for the
wife or child.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-002#17:1>
<h> How to make a complaint </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-002#18:1>
A complaint is first made to the Magistrate Court.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-002#19:1>
In the complaint, the wife must state the husband's earnings, the
number of dependent children, the amount of maintenance they need and the
circumstances under which the husband failed to provide for them.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-002#20:1>
The Magistrate will order a Summons to be sent to the husband and a
day will be fixed for a Court hearing.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-002#21:1>
The Magistrate will make a maintenance order against the husband
after hearing all the evidence.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-002#22:1>
But the husband can always appeal if he thinks the maintenance order
is unfair.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-002#23:1>
Later, if circumstances change, for instance, the husband earns more,
and the wife finds the maintenance order is inadequate, either party may
return to Court for a Variation Order.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-002#24:1>
If the husband fails to make one or more payments, he can be fined or
imprisoned for each month he is in arrears.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-002#25:1>
If the husband is in a salaried job, the wife can ask the Court for
an attachment of earning order.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-002#26:1>
This is an Order to the husband's employer to pay the amount of
maintenance to a court officer every month before paying the husband his
salary.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-002#27:1>
The wife then collects the maintenance from this officer every month.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-002#28:1>
When an attachment order is in force, the husband must inform the
court when he resigns from his job and when he gets re-employed .

<ICE-SIN:W2B-002#29:1>
When making a maintenance order, the Court will try to enable the
wife and children to enjoy the same lifestyle that the family had been used
to before the marriage broke down.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-002#30:1>
You cannot sue for an arrears of maintenance if they have accrued for
more than three years before you decided to take legal action.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-002#31:1>
<h> Question 1 </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-002#32:1>
I bought a can of drink from a shop near my home.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-002#33:1>
I drank a little and realised that the drink tasted bad.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-002#34:1>
I then poured the contents out of the can into a glass and I found
some decomposed worms in the drink.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-002#35:1>
I was ill for a few days.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-002#36:1>
Please advise me on my legal rights? <h> Answer: </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-002#37:1>
The manufacturer is responsible for taking all reasonable care to
avoid acts or omissions which he can reasonably foresee would injure his
neighbour.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-002#38:1>
Neighours are persons so closely and directly affected he should be
mindful of his acts or omissions.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-002#39:1>
In your case, the manufacturer of the can of drink owes you a duty of
care so you have a right of action against the manufacturer for negligence.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-002#40:1>
Alternatively, you could sue the seller of the can of drink since
there was a contract for the sale of the drink between you and the seller.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-002#41:1>
The ground of action would be breach of merchantable quality under
the Sale of Goods Act.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-002#42:1>
<h> Question 2 </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-002#43:1>
Last month my neighbour called me a bastard in the midst of an
argument concerning her pet cat which we were trying to settle.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-002#44:1>
I believe she did it in the heat of the moment.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-002#45:1>
However, a few days ago, when my daughter playfully pulled the tail
of the cat, she shouted, 'Stop it, you daughter of a bastard'.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-002#46:1>
Can I sue her for slander?

<ICE-SIN:W2B-002#47:1>
<h> Answer: </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-002#48:1>
Based on what you said, I do not think that you can take any action
against your neighbour.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-002#49:1>
But if she persists in being abusive, you should report the matter to
the police, who may then be able to warn your neighbour about a breach of the
peace. </I>

<h> WAYS OF THE LAW SEPARATION AGREEMENTS </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-002#51:2>
By Catherine Tay Swee Kian

<ICE-SIN:W2B-002#52:2>
LL B ( Hons) ( London); LL M ( London); of Lincoln's Inn,

<ICE-SIN:W2B-002#53:2>
Barrister-at-law;

<ICE-SIN:W2B-002#54:2>
Advocate & Solicitor of the Supreme Court of Singapore;

<ICE-SIN:W2B-002#55:2>
Senior Lecturer in Law,

<ICE-SIN:W2B-002#56:2>
National University of Singapore

<ICE-SIN:W2B-002#57:2>
A separation is an alternative to a divorce.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-002#58:2>
In a separation, the spouses are free to make binding agreements
between themselves regarding their relationship and how they should, or
should not, live together.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-002#59:2>
There are a number of ways of separating.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-002#60:2>
Firstly, you can make a simple agreement to live apart.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-002#61:2>
Or, you can make a formal agreement, known as a separation deed, to
live apart.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-002#62:2>
Thirdly, you can have a judicial separation.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-002#63:2>
The Court can also order the spouses to live apart.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-002#64:2>


<ICE-SIN:W2B-002#65:2>
<h> Simple Separation Agreement </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-002#66:2>
A couple may simply decide to separate.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-002#67:2>
An agreement made between the spouses to live apart is not contrary
to public policy and is valid and will be enforced by the Court.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-002#68:2>
<h> Formal Separation Deed </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-002#69:2>
A formal separation deed reduces the likelihood of future argument as
to what was exactly agreed.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-002#70:2>
A typical separation deed contains provision for the maintenance of
the spouse, custody of the children and a mutual covenant, one spouse
releasing the other from the marital duty to cohabit.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-002#71:2>
The deed may also touch on the family assets between the spouses.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-002#72:2>
But the Court may vary the terms of the deed if it thinks that it is
just to do so.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-002#73:2>
From a woman's point of view, it is important that a separation deed
entitles her to maintenance.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-002#74:2>
She may presently not need maintenance from her husband.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-002#75:2>
But she should still protect herself by inserting a nominal sum as
maintenance, so that should she need maintenance later, she can ask the Court
for an increase.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-002#76:2>
If there is no maintenance clause, the wife may later find it
difficult to persuade the court to order that she be paid maintenance.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-002#77:2>
<h> Judicial Separation </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-002#78:2>
The decree of judicial separation is a very suitable proposition for
spouses who are unhappy with their marriage but who cannot obtain a divorce
due to parental pressure or for religious reasons.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-002#79:2>
With a decree of judicial separation, the marriage is terminated even
though it subsists.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-002#80:2>
In other words, upon judicial separation, the spouses no longer need
to cohabit with each other.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-002#81:2>
To obtain a judicial separation you must prove the same facts as in a
divorce petition, such as adultery or desertion.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-002#82:2>
Judicial separation allows you all the rights as in a divorce.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-002#83:2>
But neither spouse is free to remarry because judicial separation
does not end the marriage in the same way that a divorce does.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-002#84:2>
A judicial separation only ends the spouses' obligations to live
together.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-002#85:2>
It also does not prevent the other spouse from getting a divorce if
she/he can.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-002#86:2>
Indeed, a judicial separation can be easily converted into a divorce.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-002#87:2>
<h> Court Order </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-002#88:2>
A Court will order a couple to live apart when there is a real danger
of domestic violence to the wife or children.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-002#89:2>
The court may make an exclusion order whereby the husband is ordered
out of the matrimonial house, thus leaving the wife and children in peace.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-002#90:2>
The court may also make a non-molestation protection order, ie
ordering the husband to stop threatening or assaulting the wife and/or
children.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-002#91:2>
<h> Question 1 </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-002#92:2>
What is the meaning of 'vicarious liability'?

<ICE-SIN:W2B-002#93:2>
I came across the term in a magazine.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-002#94:2>


<ICE-SIN:W2B-002#95:2>
<h> Answer 1 </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-002#96:2>
Vicarious liability means the responsibility of one person for the
torts ( ie wrongful acts) committed by another.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-002#97:2>
Therefore, a principal may be liable for the torts of his agents.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-002#98:2>
Likewise, a master is liable for the torts of his servants.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-002#99:2>
<h> Question 2 </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-002#100:2>
Last month, I agreed to sell my computer to a friend.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-002#101:2>
No price was mentioned in the agreement.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-002#102:2>
Am I bound to sell the computer to her?

<ICE-SIN:W2B-002#103:2>
Please advise.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-002#104:2>
<h> Answer 2 </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-002#105:2>
The contract is valid and binding even if there was no price
mentioned, but not so if you can show that negotiations are still going on.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-002#106:2>
When the price is not fixed in a contract of sale of goods, the
buyer must pay a reasonable price.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-002#107:2>
What is a reasonable price depends on the circumstances of each
case.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-002#108:2>
In other words, if the parties are silent on the price but have
entered into a valid contract, the courts will imply a reasonable price.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-002#109:2>
In your case, your friend will have to pay you a reasonable price
for the computer.

<h> WAYS OF THE LAW THE LEGAL RIGHTS OF WOMEN </h>

Senior Lecturer in Law,

<ICE-SIN:W2B-002#117:3>
National University of Singapore

<ICE-SIN:W2B-002#118:3>
As a woman, you can vote and be voted in all elections.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-002#119:3>
You can hold public office and are entitled to make contracts, sue
and be sued.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-002#120:3>
You can enjoy rights to education, employment, any profession or
carry on any business alone or in partnership.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-002#121:3>
You can own or dispose without leaving a will behind.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-002#122:3>
You can participate in all forms of activities, social, economic or
political.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-002#123:3>
These rights are not lost upon marriage.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-002#124:3>
The Women's Charter was passed in 1961 to protect the status of
women in Singapore.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-002#125:3>
Monogamous marriage has been practised since then, whereby males are
not allowed to have more than one wife.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-002#126:3>
A married woman has the same right as her husband in the running of
the home and the caring of the children.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-002#127:3>
But, if the husband fails to maintain his wife, she can apply to
Court for maintenance.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-002#128:3>
In default, he can be jailed.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-002#129:3>
A married woman may make a will to dispose of her property.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-002#130:3>
If her husband dies without a will, she is entitled to half of his
estate.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-002#131:3>
If her husband leaves all his property to another person, she can
apply under the Inheritance ( Family Provisions) Act for reasonable
maintenance, if she is dependent on him.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-002#132:3>
Upon divorce, a wife is entitled to a share of the matrimonial
property even if she did not contribute to the acquisition of the house in
cash.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-002#133:3>
The law recognises the non-monetary contributions of a housewife.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-002#134:3>
A battered wife can apply to Court for an injunction to stop her
husband from assaulting her or the children.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-002#135:3>
The court may order the husband to leave the matrimonial home even
though he is the owner of the house.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-002#136:3>
In general, all women have equal rights with men to be protected
under the Employment Act.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-002#137:3>
They are entitled to a safe workplace and, with men, have a right to
be protected from mechanical, chemical and other hazards at work.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-002#138:3>
Women also have equal rights under the Workmen Compensation Act.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-002#139:3>
All manual workers ( no matter what their earnings) and all
non-manual workers earning below
&dollar;1250 can claim workmen compensation.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-002#140:3>
But the following are not entitled to workmen compensation:

<ICE-SIN:W2B-002#141:3>
1) casual workers;

<ICE-SIN:W2B-002#142:3>
2) domestic servants;

<ICE-SIN:W2B-002#143:3>
3) non-manual worker earning above
&dollar;1250; 

<ICE-SIN:W2B-002#144:3>
4) police officers;

<ICE-SIN:W2B-002#145:3>
5) outworkers;

<ICE-SIN:W2B-002#146:3>
6) family members of the employer living with the employer; and

<ICE-SIN:W2B-002#147:3>
7) any class of persons declared by the Minister.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-002#148:3>
You can claim against your former employer under the Workmen
Compensation Act even if you contracted an occupational disease ( eg
asbestosis or industrial dermatitis) after you have left their employment.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-002#149:3>
<h> Question </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-002#150:3>
Some time in September ' 89 I paid a beautician for a double eyelid
operation.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-002#151:3>
Her method entails sewing up the upper lids to achieve folds - a
process which she claimed would last ten years. <X>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-002#X152:3>
Since July ' 90 ( barely a year later), my left double eyelid has
started disappearing.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-002#X153:3>
It looks terrible because of the extra folds that appear where the
" sewing" has come loose. </X> </I>
