old lady

<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#78:1:A>

He's under the impression

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#83:1:A>
Ya

<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#84:1:A>
He thought that the aunt wanted uhm him to be on the the same level
<{> <[> same standing </[> as Estella

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#85:1:B>
<[> Ya ya </[> </{>

<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#86:1:B>
So so that so that

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#87:1:A>
They can be together

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#88:1:B>
Uhm so it's all along he's under this impression

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#89:1:A>
Ya

<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#90:1:A>
That's so sad

<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#91:1:A>
Aiyah but I like the first time uh Finn met Estella

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#92:1:B>
Ya

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#93:1:A>
When she was only ten years old and he was seated there

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#94:1:B>
When she was well trained already

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#95:1:A>

<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#105:1:B>

<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#106:1:B>
Every every every frame well it's like a picture itself

<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#107:1:B>
The rustling wind especially the old houses the first part

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#108:1:A>
Okay

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#109:1:B>
Everything <{> <[> looks

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#110:1:A>
<[> so run-down </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#111:1:B>
Ya so run-down but yet so beautiful in a way

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#112:1:A>
Uhm

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#113:1:B>
Everything looks like a picture

<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#114:1:B>
It's print very very nicely

<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#115:1:B>
Even the part where the prisoner the final benefactor he died

<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#116:1:B>
Then the thing roll down on the floor and roll down on the things

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#117:1:A>
<{> <[> One of </[> their bottles

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#118:1:B>
<[> It's too </[> </{> beautiful and ya when he died you see
the screen the windows behind see sunlight the buildings and trees and
everything

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#119:1:A>
Uhm but I didn't understand the part when the three big
fellows

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#120:1:B>
Or bad guys

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#121:1:A>
The bad guys

<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#122:1:A>
Ya

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#123:1:B>
Gangsters

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#124:1:A>
They trying to kill <{> <[> the the </[> benefactor

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#125:1:B>
<[> Ya </[> </{>

<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#126:1:B>
He's trying to kill him

<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#127:1:B>
Correct

<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#128:1:B>
They had something going between them

<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#129:1:B>
He did say uh they when they when when the when Robert DeNiro the
guy was in his was in the his his his painting room

<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#130:1:B>
Then then Robert DeNiro was just saying that oh these guys wanted
to settle a score with me

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#131:1:A>
Uhm

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#132:1:B>
It's an old score

<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#133:1:B>
He didn't say

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#134:1:A>
It's like the past caught up with him

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#135:1:B>
It's just the past lah uhm

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#136:1:A>
Ya lah

<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#137:1:A>
Robert DeNiro did a lot of bad things but he said that there's few
good things he did

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#138:1:B>
One good thing he did

<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#139:1:B>
Ya <{> <[> which is </[> very very nice

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#140:1:A>
<[> Which was </[> </{> to help Finn realize uh his talent

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#141:1:B>
Ya

<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#142:1:B>
I was so confused

<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#143:1:B>
I was like wondering where where he got the notion that he likes
to draw

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#144:1:A>
Uhm

<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#145:1:A>
Oh ya ah

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#146:1:B>
Then I remembered it was the it was the

<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#147:1:A>
Oh yes

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#148:1:B>
book

<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#149:1:B>
It fell out of his hand into the water and he kept it

<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#150:1:B>
Ya

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#151:1:A>
The first part is so important when when Finn was at the
seaside and he just drew the fishes he saw the birds that he saw

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#152:1:B>
Ya

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#153:1:A>
So touching hor

<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#154:1:A>
Robert DeNiro actually kept the book

<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#155:1:A>
Ya

<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#156:1:A>
I thought it fell into the sea

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#157:1:B>
Ya he was so rough then

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#158:1:A>

<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#165:1:A>
The books tells more ya uses the that so called different kind of
English

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#166:1:B>
Ya and that ah you see in the book does it talk about the
upper class and the lower class <{> <[> of society </[> hor

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#167:1:A>
<[> Oh yes </[> </{>

<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#168:1:A>
Oh yes

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#169:1:B>
So pretentious ah the higher class

<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#170:1:B>
The buildings look so monotonous right

<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#171:1:B>
You get the feeling

<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#172:1:B>
The art gallery the buildings that you walk through the subway
everything look so monotonous

<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#173:1:B>
It's only when it's in the open

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#174:1:A>
Oh yeah like the

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#175:1:B>
The it looks like the the water run down the leaves rush
everywhere stuff like that uhm

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#176:1:A>
And how it comes

<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#177:1:A>
It went one full circle when when Finn comes back to his <{> <[>
house again </[> to visit his uncle Joe

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#178:1:B>
<[> Ya correct </[> </{>

<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#179:1:B>
Correct

<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#180:1:B>
And how the benefactor appear in the first and the last part
everything like a sandwich like that lah

<$A  < 

<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#181:1:A>
Ya sandwich ah

<$B>

I like the part so touching the Joe came back his uncle came came
to visit his art <{> <[> gallery </[>

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#186:1:A>

<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#187:1:B>
Ya and he didn't know how to behave and

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#188:1:A>
Ya <O> laughs </O>

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#189:1:B>
He was confused already

<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#190:1:B>
He was like part of the upper class but

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#191:1:A>
Uhm

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#192:1:B>
At the brink of it

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#193:1:A>
Ya

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#194:1:B>
Just ya

<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#195:1:B>
It's very sad

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#196:1:A>
So although he realized Finn realises his dream of bring an
artist and and being so-called rich to match uhm Estella's status you know

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#197:1:B>
Uhm

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#198:1:A>
Estella whom he loved very much

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#199:1:B>
Right

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#200:1:A>
Here he felt very empty

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#201:1:B>
Uhm

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#202:1:A>
Ya he felt very empty and he he he lost himself I thought

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#203:1:B>
Ya ya

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#204:1:A>

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#206:1:B>
<[> Ya ya </[> </{>

<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#207:1:B>
But why did tell me in the book why why did Estella I thought they
like

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#208:1:A>
Can't remember <O> laughs </O>

<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#209:1:B>
They came to but why I thought they like professed their love
for each other and then the next moment she left to get married with the <{>
<[> other guy </[>

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#210:1:A>

<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#211:1:A>
Maybe it's like what you say loh uhm

<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#212:1:A>
She's just so Estella is just so well trained by the auntie you
know

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#213:1:B>

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#217:1:B>
Right right

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#218:1:A>
Estella I mean the auntie became mad because you know she was
left alone by the <{> <[> by the fiancé </[> at the altar

<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#220:1:B>
Ya </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#221:1:A>

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#225:1:B>
Ya I get it

<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#226:1:B>

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#228:1:B>

<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#230:1:B>
<[> Don't know leh </[> </{>

<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#231:1:B>
Remember the wo the lady says Men are the bad things in life

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#232:1:A>
Because she had a bad experience you know

<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#233:1:A>
She was left at the altar but we don't know why

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#234:1:B>
Ya

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#235:1:A>
But it's beautiful in that how I mean Finn got got a chance
to realise himself right

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#236:1:B>
He's quite innocent lah

<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#237:1:B>
Hor innocent

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#238:1:A>
Do you think it's a love story also

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#239:1:B>
It is a love story lah

<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#240:1:B>
To me to me it's a love story lor

<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#241:1:B>
Uhm what is it to you

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#242:1:A>
Ya in a way it is

<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#243:1:A>
It's about men

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#244:1:B>
Men again

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#245:1:A>
<O> laughter </O>

<$B>

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#248:1:B>
Ah

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#249:1:A>
Okay but it is also about the prisoner you know

<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#250:1:A>
So so called low-class you know did a lot of bad things

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#251:1:B>
Uhm uhm

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#252:1:A>
And yet so although he's bad he can still do one good thing
you know

<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#253:1:A>
You know he help he helps Finn to you know become who he is you
know

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#254:1:B>
Uhm uhm

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#255:1:A>
And yet the upper class supposedly to have everything but
then they <{> <[> what good did </[> they do

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#256:1:B>
<[> Ya </[> </{>

<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#257:1:B>
Ya they're so pretentious

<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#258:1:B>
Everyone dressed up in their black tie and like the <{> <[> coat
and everything </[>

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#259:1:A>
<[> Ya uhm </[> </{>

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#260:1:B>
And they make their stupid jokes you remember

<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#261:1:B>
The part they asked asked uh Finn how much do you charge your
paintings

<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#262:1:B>
By

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#263:1:A>
Oh ya

<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#264:1:A>
<O> laughter </O>

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#265:1:B>
By the inch or by the

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#266:1:A>
How long it takes

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#267:1:B>
How long it takes or by <{> <[> and stuff like that </[>

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#268:1:A>
<[> Uhm ya </[> </{>

<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#269:1:A>
So it says bad things about the upper class in a way

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#270:1:B>
Ya

<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#271:1:B>
It's pretty clear

<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#272:1:B>
It's pretty clear

<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#273:1:B>
Ya clear

<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#274:1:B>
Nice lah

<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#275:1:B>
Very

<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#276:1:B>
I find it very nice

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#277:1:A>
Uhm

<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#278:1:A>
Quite empty right

<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#279:1:A>
The lives they have <{> <[> the upper class </[>

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#280:1:B>
<[> Very ya very </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#281:1:A>
They dress up so well but actually I don't know

<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#282:1:A>
I kind of like that kind of life where you just go to seem just be
with nature

<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#283:1:A>
Like what Finn and and and did at the beginning you know

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#284:1:B>
Ya

<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#285:1:B>
In the beginning the narration was beautiful lor

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#286:1:A>
Ya

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#287:1:B>
Some some of the things Finn says but can't really can't
really remember but it says like you know that when benefactor experience uhm
when he says like uhm

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#288:1:A>
Like uh ya when you look from over her a little bit it's a
bit <{> <[> noisy there </[>

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#289:1:B>
<[> Ya right </[> </{>

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#290:1:A>
But I can't hear what he was saying

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#291:1:B>
Oh ya ya

<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#292:1:B>
He was saying something like let me think ah

<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#293:1:B>
Let me think

<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#294:1:B>
Uh oh after that benefactor experience when the small kid he says
something like Sometimes in life uh no not in life sometimes you have a look
just a little brush with real life

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#295:1:A>
Uh ya

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#296:1:B>
And that's when you really experience

<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#297:1:B>
You know what life can really be that tremendous experience that
he has as a kid when Robert DeNiro like captured him and made him made him do
certain things and things like that

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#298:1:A>
Uhm

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#299:1:B>
Ya

<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#300:1:B>
That that

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#301:1:A>
I I I also like that part when uh Finn says I'd like to tell
the story

<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#302:1:A>
Not as it happens

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#303:1:B>
Ah

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#304:1:A>
But <{> <[> as I remember </[>

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#305:1:B>
Ya <[> as you remember </[> </{> ya

<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#306:1:B>
That's beautiful

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#307:1:A>
That's just like you right

<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#308:1:A>
You like to remember things

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#309:1:B>
I mean you you that's how we remember

<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#310:1:B>
Ya

<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#311:1:B>
What we remember is always the assets

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#312:1:A>
Ya the assets

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#313:1:B>
And the beauty of it the feelings

<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#314:1:B>
You don't really remember the actual things hor you know events
and things like that <X>

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#X315:1:A>
Well so finally when he become so called successful he went
back to his his old life and and and I think that's where he finds himself
again you know

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#X316:1:B>
Uhm

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#X317:1:A>
And then he went back to the the run-down house where he's
supposed to do the gardening with the { once years ago

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#X318:1:B>
{ Correct

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#X319:1:A>
And then what did he saw what did he saw Or who did he saw

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#X320:1:B>
Uh huh

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#X321:1:A>
The little girl { again Right

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#X322:1:B>
{ The little girl ya the little girl again

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#X323:1:A>
Don't tell me that's Estella again

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#X324:1:B>
Ya

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#X325:1:A>
But

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#X326:1:B>
But the first thing he said was   I saw her again

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#X327:1:A>
  I saw her again  

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#X328:1:B>
And he thought she was Stella But actually she's a little
girl who looks like 'Stella when she was young Ya

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#X329:1:A>
Some of the lines are very nice ah like uh   I saw her again
 

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#X330:1:B>
Ya

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#X331:1:A>
It set some expectations ya

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#X332:1:B>
Uhm

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#X333:1:A>
And then then the camera like what you like to say ah the
camera pans***

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#X334:1:B>
ah aiyoyo you know your stuff very well You learn
thoroughly

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#X335:1:A>
<O> laughter </O> and the I like that scene ah the steps leading to
the the sea and

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#X336:1:B>
Ya beautiful and then ghost feeling is gone Birds are flying
through the place

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#X337:1:A>
Ya Uhm there was a breakthrough like

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#X338:1:B>
There was a breakthrough like eh eh

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#X339:1:A>
And then Estella and him met again

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#X340:1:B>
Ya

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#X341:1:A>
But that part when he says erm when when something about
understanding each other at the end when they were talking to each other what
is that

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#X342:1:B>
It was like love like love first at first sight

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#X343:1:A>
Mm uhm

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#X344:1:B>
Say that uh like the like Estella say that   Can you ever
forgive me   Say that {   don't you understand me  

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#X345:1:A>
{ orhh

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#X346:1:B>
Then they look at each other without saying a single thing
and the narrator say that she understood all along

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#X347:1:A>
So in just very few words we get the idea it conveys the
message that actually their love is so strong that it can cross class
boundaries

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#X348:1:B>
Class boundaries uh years

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#X349:1:A>
Uhm yes

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#X350:1:B>
Ya

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#X351:1:A>
Many years

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#X352:1:B>
Many many years ya

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#X353:1:A>
Ya more than 10 years

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#X354:1:B>
More than 10 ya

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#X355:1:A>
At first I felt a bit sad because urm how come Estella
always promises to be there and then you know she didn't turn up you
know

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#X356:1:B>
Yeah she never turn up

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#X357:1:A>
For example the opening of his show his you know his
paintings she said   I'll be there   and yet she wasn't there

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#X358:1:B>
Ya it was like the revenge loh

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#X359:1:A>
Orh

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#X360:1:B>
Remember uh 'Stella's grandmother

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#X361:1:A>
Uhm

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#X362:1:B>
Uh forsaken at the altar the guy never turned up so it is
the same thing here

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#X363:1:A>
Uhm

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#X364:1:B>
Art gallery supposed to be there It's a fulfilment of his
dreams everything that he ever wanted But he wasn't { she wasn't there

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#X365:1:A>
{ She wasn't there uhm

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#X366:1:B>
Ya right it was like the ultimate revenge lah

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#X367:1:A>
I see and instead she got married right

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#X368:1:B>
Ya that's worse right

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#X369:1:A>
To a guy whom we can { tell she doesn't really love ya

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#X370:1:B>
 So sickening ya I like the part when give me your
hand and he put the put it on the heart and say  What is what is that 
he said Wah and first thing as a small boy he said it was the boobs <O> 
laughter </O>

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#X371:1:A>
Ya when he was a small boy and everyone touches Estella's
auntie's heart so scared

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#X372:1:B>
Boobs lah

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#X373:1:A>
Boobs <O>  laughter </O> Estella says it's my heart

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#X374:1:B>
Sure

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#X375:1:A>
And it's broken and it went full circle again ah

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#X376:1:B>
Ya ya and she realises how much it hurts and she I
think she was quite regretful also

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#X377:1:A>
Uhm for what she has done to him

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#X378:1:B>
The aunt the aunt ya that's why She knows how what it feels
ya to be the other side

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#X379:1:A>
'Cause ya

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-090#X380:1:B>
