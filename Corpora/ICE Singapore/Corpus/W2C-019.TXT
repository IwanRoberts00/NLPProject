<h> PAP Foundation to cap nursery places at 20,000 for few years </h>

<h> Foundation's top priority is to provide kindergarten education
</h>

<ICE-SIN:W2C-019#4:1>
NURSERIES run by the PAP Community Foundation ( PCF) offered about
9,000 extra places last year to meet the demand from parents in neighbourhood
estates, said Dr Arthur Beng.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-019#5:1>
The chairman of the PCF kindergarten committee told The Straits Times
in an interview that about 21,000 places were provided last year compared
with only about 12,000 places in 1991.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-019#6:1>
But, 20,000 places is the limit, he said.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-019#7:1>
The cap at 20,000 will stay for the next few years and this total will
cater for about half the number of babies expected to be born.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-019#8:1>
This limit will remain until the PCF is able to cope with its No.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-019#9:1>
1 priority to provide kindergarten education.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-019#10:1>
Kindergarten education, he said, is more important as it helps
prepare children for primary education.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-019#11:1>
He said: " We have noticed the surge in demand for nurseries in the
past five years.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-019#12:1>
But, nurseries are not our priority.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-019#13:1>
" Its better that a child looks forward anxiously to going to
kindergarten rather than cry when he goes to nursery," he said.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-019#14:1>
He added: " There is no necessity to generate a demand for nursery
places." The Straits Times asked him to comment on the growing demand for
nursery places at PCF-run kindergartens, and how the foundation, a main
provider of kindergarten places at 240 education centres, is going to cater
to the demand.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-019#15:1>
The centres, spread out in Housing Board estates, charge about
&dollar;30 a month for three-year-olds who attend two-hour nursery classes a day.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-019#16:1>
At kindergarten, five- and six-year-olds attend two- or four-hour
classes daily and, depending on what they study, pay
&dollar;20 to
&dollar;80 a month.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-019#17:1>
Private centres charge about
&dollar;150 for nursery and
&dollar;500 for kindergarten classes.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-019#18:1>
The PCF, Dr Beng said, has seen the demand for nursery places coming,
based on these two developments: THE birth rate has been going up since 1987
and is now about 49,000 a year PCF kindergartens have seen a big jump in the
number of nursery places up from 11,893 in 1991 to 20,825 in 1992.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-019#19:1>
The number should stabilise at around 20,000 a year and hence the
PCF, which runs these classes, has decided to cap them at this figure.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-019#20:1>
The PCF will be able to cope with this target as 3 education centres
have been built in the past two years.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-019#21:1>
Dr Beng had this advice for parents: " Do not be coerced by peer
pressure, otherwise your child is the one who will lose out." Parents
interviewed earlier said that they were sending their children to nurseries
to help them make more friends and study.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-019#22:1>
Many are uncomfortable with the idea of maids teaching their
children.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-019#23:1>
They feel that maids should only wash, feed and look after children.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-019#24:1>
Dr Beng also asked parents to be accommodating as not every child can
be placed at a centre in the block where they live.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-019#25:1>
" We understand that the children are young.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-019#26:1>
" We know that walking three blocks and crossing two streets may be a
problem for them," he said THERE are no tests and homework in PAP Community
Foundation ( PCF) nurseries and parents are wrong if they think that studying
there will help their young to top Primary 1, said Dr Arthur Beng.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-019#27:1>
Instead, the three-year-olds studying at the 174 education centres
are taught through play how to listen, speak, socialise and hold a paint
brush.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-019#28:1>
A structured syllabus to teach language skills and numbers is used
only when the children attend kindergarten classes at age five and six.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-019#29:1>
Dr Beng, who is in charge of the PCF's Kindergarten Committee, was
responding to some parents' views in The Sunday Times.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-019#30:1>
Some parents had said that they were anxious to enrol their chidden
in nurseries so that the toddlers can make friends and study.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-019#31:1>
Many were working parents who did not like the idea of leaving the
maids to teach their children.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-019#32:1>
They felt that maids should only feed and wash their kids.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-019#33:1>
Some said that having children in the PAP-run nurseries would help
them score better when they entered primary school.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-019#34:1>
Dr Beng said: " I would like to stress to parents that they should
not expect a rigid curriculum.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-019#35:1>
" Parents should also not expect their children to write or do
homework.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-019#36:1>
Homework and tests may turn a child off." To help the young minds,
the centres had cut the three-hour sessions to two hours, he said.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-019#37:1>
During these sessions, children are taught language skills, not
through writing but by speaking and listening.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-019#38:1>
Children are taught to sit still and listen during story telling
sessions.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-019#39:1>
" If the child's attention span is short, he will not be adequately
prepared for Primary 1," Dr Beng said.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-019#40:1>
His advice: " I'll not say that if a child misses out on nursery, he
will not go to the university.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-019#41:1>
Each parent has to decide what's best for his child." </I>

<h> Parents rush to enrol toddlers in nursery school </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2C-019#43:2>
<h> More places planned in PCF-run pre-schools </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2C-019#46:2>
KINDERGARTENS run by the PAP Community Foundation ( PCF) are seeing a
rush of toddlers some as young s 18 months being enrolled for classes.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-019#47:2>
This has prompted the kindergartens to plan for more nursery places.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-019#48:2>
Dr Arthur Beng, chairman of PCF's Kindergarten Committee, told The
Straits Times: " We have observed the trend that parents want to send their
children to nurseries." He said that the foundation was trying to provide
nursery places and train nursery teachers.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-019#49:2>
Nursery facilities are now available at about 150 kindergartens out
of the 240 PCF-run kindergartens.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-019#50:2>
But, the foundation's priority, he said, was to build more
kindergarten classes to help prepare pupils for primary education, he said.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-019#51:2>
" Missing a nursery year is not as crucial as missing kindergarten,"
he said.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-019#52:2>
The Punggol ward in Cheng San GRC had a taste of the " nursery rush"
recently at a registration exercise at its education centre in Block 414,
Hougang Avenue 10.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-019#53:2>
When the 45 places available were filled, some angry parents who had
queued overnight started shouting.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-019#54:2>
One mother kicked a door and punched the windows.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-019#55:2>
The police had to be called in.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-019#56:2>
Explaining what happened, the ward's MP, Dr Michael Lim, told The
Sunday Times that several parents refused to switch to a nearby centre which
had vacancies.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-019#57:2>
Dr Lim said: " What happened that day was unfortunate." He and his
staff had seen this new demand for nursery places coming, he said.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-019#58:2>
One kindergarten class was converted into a nursery class, creating
45 more places to prepare for the second registration phase.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-019#59:2>
He said that about 45 parents on the waiting list were later given
places in the four other centres in Punggol.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-019#60:2>
To cater for future demand, Dr Lim said, there are plans to build a
new pre-school centre in 1995, bringing the total in his ward to six centres
offering 2,300 nursery and kindergarten places.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-019#61:2>
Of the six, one is run by the People's Association while the rest are
run by the PCF.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-019#62:2>
Children between 18 months and three years old attend nursery classes
before starting kindergarten classes at the age of four.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-019#63:2>
PCF-run nurseries offer four two-hour nursery sessions a day.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-019#64:2>
Parents pay from
&dollar;360 a year at a PCF-run centre to
&dollar;6,480 at private centres.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-019#65:2>
Dr Lim said that there was more demand for nursery places because
young couples now make up about half of the 19,000 Punggol estate households.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-019#66:2>
The emphasis on education is one reason.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-019#67:2>
" Nobody wants their child to be left behind," he said.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-019#68:2>
Seven private child care centres and nurseries also say they see a
growing demand for nursery places.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-019#69:2>
They could not give figures but said they were receiving more calls
asking specifically about nursery facilities.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-019#70:2>
Mrs Yap Siow Kuan, Head Child Care Operator at Kinderland Educare
Services, said more parents are now asking if nursery places will be offered
in their estates.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-019#71:2>
A spokesman from the NTUC Child Care Co-operative said that feedback
from its 17 child care centres showed that parents wanted music and movement
- a component of a nursery programme to be taught.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-019#72:2>
A Ministry of Community Development spokesman said that some of the
285 child care centres offer nursery facilities.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-019#73:2>
Others could follow suit.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-019#74:2>
They only need to inform the ministry about the nursery facilities
being offered, said the spokesman.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-019#75:2>
Parents opting for shorter hours of nursery schools WITH toddlers
beginning school so early, parents are opting for nursery schools which offer
shorter hours, instead of the usual half- or full-day care at child care
centres.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-019#76:2>
Parents prefer shorter hours because younger children adapt better to
them, said several of the 10 mothers and fathers interviewed.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-019#77:2>
They are also sending them to play school early because tiny tots
with nursery training socialise better and have strong scores when they enter
primary school.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-019#78:2>
The parents' main aim in sending their children to nursery schools
was to help the young ones make friends and learn to be independent.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-019#79:2>
Almost all of them were working parents and did not like the idea of
maids teaching the youngsters.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-019#80:2>
Maids should only help wash, feed and look after the children they
said.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-019#81:2>
Mr Khong Mun Pew, 35, a civil servant, said he pulled his first son
out of a child care centre when the boy started throwing tantrums at the end
of the day.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-019#82:2>
" He didn't have his toys and brothers to play with the whole day, so
he didn't like the full-day programme." His son adjusted well when he went on
a three-hour programme, and Mr Khong plans to put his two other sons aged two
and 16 months old, into a similar programme.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-019#83:2>
Mrs Brenda Yeo, 35, a secretary with two sons, aged two and one, is
another parent who believes in an early start.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-019#84:2>
She said: " When I was six months pregnant, I began calling nurseries
to book a place.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-019#85:2>
They told me to come back after my son turned one."

<ICE-SIN:W2C-019#86:2>
She wants her sons to go first to a nursery school which emphasises
learning through play.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-019#87:2>
After one year, her sons will attend a nursery school where the
syllabus emphasises learning the alphabet, numbers and Mandarin.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-019#88:2>
" This will help them adjust well to a structured syllabus in Primary
One.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-019#89:2>
They will also score well.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-019#90:2>
" People can say I'm kiasu, but as a parent I only want the best for
my children." Are such parents putting too much pressure on their toddlers?

<ICE-SIN:W2C-019#91:2>
All the parents agreed with Mrs Bertilla Watanabe, 32, a copywriter,
who felt her two-year-old son would benefit from having more friends to play
with.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-019#92:2>
" It would be cheaper for me to keep him at home.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-019#93:2>
I could save
&dollar;340 a month," she said.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-019#94:2>
Mrs Jenny Chan, 38, a clerk, said that to cut costs she sent both her
sons to a PAP Community Foundation education centre near her flat in Yishun.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-019#95:2>
She is happy with the fees of
&dollar;30 and the more formal Mandarin and mathematics lessons.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-019#96:2>
Mrs Yuhidar Abdullah, 28, however, has found that Mother is still
best.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-019#97:2>
She quit her teaching job to look after her sons, aged three and 1
1/2.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-019#98:2>
She said that when she sent her elder boy to a nursery school to make
friends, he began protesting.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-019#99:2>
" Maybe he was just too young when I sent him.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-019#100:2>
He wanted me to teach him at home and I have given in," she said.

<h> Growing demand for pork from Australia </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2C-019#102:3>
With the scarce supply of live pigs, imports of chilled Aussie pork
have shot up since the virus outbreak.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-019#103:3>

<ICE-SIN:W2C-019#105:3>
Pork from Down Under is making its presence felt on dinner tables
here.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-019#106:3>
Suppliers have had to turn to chilled australian pork to satisfy
customers, filling a vacuum left after live pig imports from Malaysia were
banned.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-019#107:3>
Singapore imported about 87 kg of chilled pork a day in January, two
months before the Nipah virus outbreak in March.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-019#108:3>
In april, the figure shot up to an average of 24 tonnes ( 24,000 kg)
a day. <X>

<ICE-SIN:W2C-019#X109:3>
Last month, it went up to 29 tonnes daily, the Primary Production
Department ( PPD) said.
