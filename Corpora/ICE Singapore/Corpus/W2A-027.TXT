The mechanisms of desorption phenomena of solids under laser
irradiation exploit defects and defect processes.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-027#8:1>
This paper surveys the optical damages of ionic crystals and
electronically - stimulated desorption both in ionic crystals and GaP.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-027#9:1>
Their properties in relation to such mechanisms are summarized.

<h> INTRODUCTION </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-027#11:1>
In the study of desorption phenomena of solids under optical or
particle irradiation, defects and defect processes are important components.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-027#12:1>
Firstly, there may be intrinsic defects already present before the
irradiation or some transient defects created by the incident beam.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-027#13:1>
Once the particle energies have been converted to thermal or
electronic energy, there are several defect processes which may lead to
defect annihilation or aggregation, or to processes like two-hole
localization.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-027#14:1>
In the present paper, we discuss some of the main defects and defect
processes in the context of the optical damages of alkali halides and GaP.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-027#15:1>
In this case, experimental work alone is not sufficient for a full
understanding of the processes involved.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-027#16:1>
It is because the actual situation may be very complex and non-ideal
that experiment cannot separate the many components involved.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-027#17:1>
The role of theory is to give quantitative predictions of the
physical variables that make a system behave in one way rather than another,
and ultimately with the use of such theory, to control or modify processes in
desirable ways.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-027#18:1>
<h> RADIATION EFFECTS IN NON-METALLIC SOLIDS </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-027#19:1>
In interactions of radiation with non-metallic solids, the energy
possessed by incident particles is transformed into the electronic excitation
energy and lattice energy 1.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-027#20:1>
The lattice energy causes displacements of atoms from perfect sites
and enhances thermal vibrations.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-027#21:1>
The electronic excitation energy can ( i) excite an electron from the
core ( generate a core-hole) to the conduction band ( ii) generate a hole in
the valence band and electrons in conduction bands.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-027#22:1>
The density of valence - electron excitation can be quite high.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-027#23:1>
The de-excitation from electronically excited states can produce
vacancies and interstitials and even removal of the surface atoms in alkali
halides.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-027#24:1>
However, in ordinary valence-electron excitation, no atomic processes
are induced in most of the semiconductors.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-027#25:1>
<h> SELF-TRAPPED EXCITONS IN ALKALI HALIDES </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-027#26:1>
In the perfect crystal, the halide ions are in closed-shell
configurations and so if they are brought together there is no net bonding.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-027#27:1>
If a hole is trapped on a pair of halide ions, an antibonding orbital
is left only partially occupied, and net bonding occurs.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-027#28:1>
The result is that the self-trapping distortion involves the approach
of two halide X-ions to form an effective ( X2)-molecule within the crystal
and is strongly favoured energetically.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-027#29:1>
The field of the self-trapped hole or VK centre is sufficient to bind
an electron in a more diffuse S-like state and is termed self-trapped exciton
2.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-027#30:1>
In its ground state the hole is effectively immobilized, self-trapped
by the formation of a molecular ion.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-027#31:1>
Self-trapped excitons are typically formed in a state where either
the electron or the hole or both are excited.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-027#32:1>
These states are often denoted by the symbols [ e*h], [ eh*] and [
e*h*] respectively.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-027#33:1>
The self-trapped exciton can recombine by the following mechanisms 3:

<ICE-SIN:W2A-027#34:1>
( 1) non-radiative with lifetime of lO-l2 s, giving damage / defects;

<ICE-SIN:W2A-027#35:1>
( 2) spin-allowed radiative ( a-luminesence) with radiative lifetime
of 10_8 s;

<ICE-SIN:W2A-027#36:1>
( 3) spin-forbidden radiative ( ++-luminesence) with radiative
lifetime of 10-3 s; as well as a variety of non-radiative channels with a
range of lifetimes.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-027#37:1>
In the situation of high carrier densities, where the interaction
between the single excitation events cannot be neglected, the recombination
energy may be transferred to the electronic degrees of freedom and hence the
defect is excited electronically.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-027#38:1>
The activation energy in an excited state is lower than the ground
state.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-027#39:1>
Examples include the motion of self-trapped holes2 and vacancies in
ionic crystals 4.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-027#40:1>
As mentioned earlier, nonradiative recombination gives rise to defect
production ( Fig 1) eg [ eh*] -F +H where the self-trapped excition is in
its excited state.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-027#41:1>
No defect formation is possible from the ground-state self-trapped
exciton.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-027#42:1>
Such a nonradiative recombination process may be a significant factor
in the desorption of halogen atoms from alkali halide surfaces.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-027#43:1>
This is elaborated upon in the next section.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-027#44:1>
<h> DESORPTION INDUCED BY ELECTRONIC TRANSITIONS IN ALKALI HALIDES
</h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-027#45:1>
Basically, two types of models have been suggested to explain
desorption induced by two different types of excitation: the
Menzel-Gomer-Redhead ( MGR) model for excitation of valence electrons and the
Knotek-Feibelman ( KF) mechanism for excitation of core electrons.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-027#46:1>
In the MGR model, a Frank-Condon transition of valence electrona
takes a bonding state into an antibonding state.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-027#47:1>
The creation of this antibonding state leads to a competition between
electronic de-excitation and desorption.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-027#48:1>
The KF mechanism explains the desorption processes induced by
core-electron excitation and assumes that localised two holes produced in the
valence band due to Auger transition to a core hole lead to emission of ions
resulting from Coulomb repulsion.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-027#49:1>
Here desorption predominates if the lifetime of the repulsive
localised two holes is sufficiently long.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-027#50:1>
It has been suggested that this condition is satisfied if the
hole-hole correlation energy ( U) is larger than the valence bandwidth ( W).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-027#51:1>
The localisation, however, is not a sufficient condition for
desorption to occur.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-027#52:1>
The desorption process is also affected by the coordination number as
well as the type of bonding.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-027#53:1>
For alkali halides and alkali-earth fluorides electron-lattice
coupling is strong and therefore excitons and holes may be localised.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-027#54:1>
Thus self-trapping of excitons provides a site for the localisation
of the energy possessed by an exciton.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-027#55:1>
However, a self-trapped exciton is structurally unstable and would
decay to a vacancy and interstitial atom.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-027#56:1>
Therefore a self-trapped exciton near the surface may eventually
become a halogen ion vacancy and an emitted halogen atom.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-027#57:1>
The energy possessed by localised excitons is converted partly to the
kinetic energy of atoms being emitted.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-027#58:1>
The mechanism of desorption of halogen atom induced by
valence-electron excitation is therefore an example of MGR mechanism.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-027#59:1>
In MGR mechanism, the yield of the desorption is proportional to the
number of excitations of the valence electrons.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-027#60:1>
<h> LASER SPUTTERING FROM GaP </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-027#61:1>
<h> 1) Experimental results </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-027#62:1>
Experimental results from Itoh's group6 on laser induced sputtering
of GaP can be summarized as follows ( Fig 2):

<ICE-SIN:W2A-027#63:1>
( 1) There is a threshold fluence for desorption and sputtering yield
varies as a power law with laser fluence.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-027#64:1>
The threshold fluence is wavelength dependent.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-027#65:1>
The power law relation indicates that single excitation of surfaces
does not lead to desorption but the interaction between excitation is needed
for desorption, unlike that for alkali halides.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-027#66:1>
( 2) The change of the sputtering yield of Ga induced by repeated
laser irradiation on the same spot is as follows: For low fluence, the LEED
pattern does not change and the sputtering yield decreases rapidly at the
beginning of the irradiation and becomes a constant.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-027#67:1>
For high fluence, the LEED spot is fading and the sputtering yield
increases as pulsed irradiation is repeated.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-027#68:1>
<h> 2) Defect-initiated particle emission from GaP ( 110) surfaces
</h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-027#69:1>
In order to understand the experimental results, we perform a
semi-empirical quantum mechanical calculation of the energy needed to eject a
Ga or P atom7 from several types of defect sites on the GaP ( 110) surface.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-027#70:1>
The results are summarized in Table 1.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-027#71:1>
Energy ( eV) needed to remove a Ga atom or P atom from various defect
sites on surfaces. <X>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-027#X72:1>
Defect type Ga@ perfect site vacancies Ga vacancy P vacancy Ga-P
divacancy step site adatoms 2.67 2.82 2.98 2.40 1.46 2.59 1.32 2 2.31 3 Ga
adatom P adatom anti-sites Ga(P) 2.58 P(Ga) .15 .61 2.06 4.20 </X>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-027#73:1>
Our results show that desorption of Ga or P atoms from the perfect
sites generally require higher energies compared with those from defect
sites.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-027#74:1>
The results confirm that defect-initiated particle desorption
dominates over the desorption from the perfect sites.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-027#75:1>
It is shown that the energy for desorption of a Ga atom from an
adatom is smaller than that from a step.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-027#76:1>
Experimental observation shows that the sputtering yield decreases as
the number of laser shots on the same spot increases when the fluence is
below a damage threshold.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-027#77:1>
It can be attributed to Ga atom desorbing from the adatom site.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-027#78:1>
The adatom will be eliminated by laser irradiation.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-027#79:1>
When the number of step sites is infinite on the surface, the
sputtering yield will remain constant as the number of laser shots increases.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-027#80:1>
We now examine the results for vacancies.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-027#81:1>
If a P vacancy exists on the surface, a Ga atom is desorbed with a
less energy than a P atom from its nearest neighbour, forming a Ga-P
divacancy.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-027#82:1>
Since desorption of both Ga and P atoms near the divacancy involves
relatively low binding energies, emission of another atom will occur
subsequently.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-027#83:1>
We may expect that desorption of a P atom from a Ga-P-Ga trivacancy
and of a Ga atom from P-Ga-P vacancy to proceed with less energy.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-027#84:1>
Similarly if a Ga vacancy exists on the surface, a vacancy cluster
will evolve after a P atom is emitted.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-027#85:1>
The calculations illustrate that the laser ablation could be
initiated by vacancies on surfaces.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-027#86:1>
The evolution of the vacancy cluster can also penetrate deep into the
surface layers.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-027#87:1>
Based on the above results, we suggest a mechanism to generate "
defect-free" perfect surfaces based on repetition of the following 2
procedures: deposition of constituent atoms to eliminate vacancies on the
surface and laser-irradiation to eliminate steps and adatoms.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-027#88:1>
<h> 3) Mechanism for desorption: multi-hole excitation </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-027#89:1>
Relaxation of a lattice, induced by formation of a hole and multi -
holes on defects on a surface of GaP, has been investigated by Khoo et al.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-027#90:1>
It is shown that hole localisation on a surface atoms constituting
the defect induces catastrophic behaviour.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-027#91:1>
The lack of symmetry for atoms on the surface exhibits a variety of
features of coupling of the lattice with electronic excitations.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-027#92:1>
For the case of an adatom ( Fig 3), a single ionization induces a
metastable state and the second excitation breaks the bond.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-027#93:1>
For the case of Ga antisite ( Fig 4) where a defect with trapped
holes is located near the surface, an excitation causes the transfer of the
hole to the surface atom inducing an intermediate state in which the surface
atom is bonded weakly.* This weakly bonded intermediate state can be
re-excited further and the bond for the surface atom is finally broken,
leading to desorption.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-027#94:1>
The initial state ( Sl) of the Ga antisite defect located just below
the surface is a negative -u state.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-027#95:1>
In the bulk, excitation would lead to the production of a metastable
state higher in energy.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-027#96:1>
However, our results suggest that at the surface, because of lack of
symmetry, excitation may lead to the production of a stable intermediate
state lower in energy ( S2).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-027#97:1>
The appearance of this non-negative u state is therefore only for
cases where there is a symmetry. </I>

<h> D SEROEPIDEMIOLOGY OF CYTOMEGALOVIRUS INFECTION </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-027#99:2>
<h> INTRODUCTION </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-027#100:2>
Cytomegalovirus ( CMV) infection is usually asymptomatic.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-027#101:2>
However, it can present with a wide spectrum of disease
manifestations including severe congenital malformation, a mononucleosis
syndrome in adolescents and young adults, and fatal disseminated infection in
immunocompromised persons.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-027#102:2>
Following primary infection, the virus becomes latent and may
reactivate to cause recurrent infection, especially in bone marrow and kidney
transplant recipients.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-027#103:2>
The virus is excreted in urine, saliva, breast milk, cervical
secretions and faeces.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-027#104:2>
Transmission occurs vertically from mother to child and horizontally
by intimate contact with an infectious person.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-027#105:2>
As viraemia may also be present in asymptomatic persons, primary
infection can follow blood transfusion.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-027#106:2>
A seroepidemiological survey was conducted in 1990 to determine the
prevalence of CMV infection in Singapore.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-027#107:2>
Blood samples were collected from apparently healthy infants and
children who were being followed up for routine health assessment at a
postnatal clinic, women attending government antenatal clinics, and blood
donors.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-027#108:2>
Sera were analysed for IgG antibodies to CMV by enzyme immunoassay
at the Virus Laboratory, Department of Pathology, Singapore General Hospital.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-027#109:2>
<h> RESULTS </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-027#110:2>
A total of 500 persons comprising 288 males and 212 females between
6 months and 45+ years of age were tested.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-027#111:2>
Of these, 327 ( 65.4%) possessed antibodies to CMV.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-027#112:2>
The seroprevalence increased wih age from 32% in young children
below 5 years of age to 53%-66% in older children and teenagers 5-19 years
of age, and to 86%-94% in adults above 20 years of age ( Fig 6.10). <X>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-027#X113:2>
Females had a higher prevalence than males ( 73.6% and 59.4%,
respectively) ( Table 6.1), with the greatest difference in adolescents and
young adults between 15 and 24 years of age ( females 94%, males 58%, odds
ratio 11.3; 95% confidence interval 2.8-37.5).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-027#X114:2>
The ethnic-specific prevalence rate of Indians ( 82.8%) was higher
than that of Chinese ( 63.4%), Malays ( 71.2%) and others ( 66.7%), but the
differences were not statistically significant Table 6.2). </X> </I>
