<ICE-SIN:S1A-021#220:1:A>
But I don't want to buy shoes on Studio any more

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-021#221:1:B>
Why

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-021#222:1:A>
Because I see so many women at Studio buying shoes

<ICE-SIN:S1A-021#223:1:A>
Call it snob value

<ICE-SIN:S1A-021#224:1:A>
What do I care

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-021#225:1:B>
Snob

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-021#226:1:A>

<ICE-SIN:S1A-021#236:1:B>

fifty in the houses

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-021#237:1:A>
Which part of the store is this

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-021#238:1:B>
The shoes shoe section uh

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-021#239:1:A>
I didn't you know I didn't take a look in all

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-021#240:1:B>
It was very weird because they bunched it up with their own
house label

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-021#241:1:A>
Oh

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-021#242:1:B>

too many women and I just like

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-021#244:1:B>
Ya ya

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-021#245:1:A>
Go somewhere else

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-021#246:1:B>
Yesterday no not yesterday I think on the day before when I
went through browsing through that place uhm I think they only had three or
four styles left you know

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-021#247:1:A>
Oh it's cheaper range right

<ICE-SIN:S1A-021#248:1:A>
Maggie said fifty dollars

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-021#249:1:B>
Ya I was so shocked

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-021#250:1:A>
But usually the shoes you really want to get good pair

<ICE-SIN:S1A-021#251:1:A>
Mine's also to <unclear> word </unclear> right

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-021#252:1:B>
Oh ya next time I buy myself in Boston <unclear> word

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-021#253:1:A>
Look there got <unclear> word </unclear> shoes and everything
down there

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-021#254:1:B>
Ya but they're

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-021#255:1:A>
at such great prices

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-021#256:1:B>
If you can get your size

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-021#257:1:A>
Ya lah you snatch the pair that's in the other woman's hand

<ICE-SIN:S1A-021#258:1:A>
That's not my size

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-021#259:1:B>
You knew your <unclear> word </unclear>

<ICE-SIN:S1A-021#260:1:B>
No I can't really get shoes my size there

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-021#261:1:A>
No you've been buying shoes

<ICE-SIN:S1A-021#262:1:A>
I haven't seen a new pair in quite a while

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-021#263:1:B>
Can't afford it buying <unclear> word </unclear>

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-021#264:1:A>
Ha ha ha ha ha ha

<ICE-SIN:S1A-021#265:1:A>
In good deaf

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-021#266:1:B>
But they are cheaper than shoes and clothes so I can buy more

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-021#267:1:A>
That is perverse watching

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-021#268:1:B>
It was <unclear> word </unclear>

<ICE-SIN:S1A-021#269:1:B>
Can't afford it

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-021#270:1:A>
Seventeen dollars times ten hundred and seventy

<ICE-SIN:S1A-021#271:1:A>
You could have bought a pair of shoes instead of going deaf

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-021#272:1:B>
What deaf

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-021#273:1:A>

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-021#274:1:B>
Ten uh wow
