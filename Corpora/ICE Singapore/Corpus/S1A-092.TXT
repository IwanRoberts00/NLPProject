<ICE-SIN:S1A-092#172:1:B>
So uhm they they I think they couldn't really figure out how to
what to do with us lah so <unclear> word </unclear> then then they cram the

They treat us like some don't know what like that cram us with a
lot of things

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-092#174:1:A>
Uhm uhm

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-092#175:1:B>
