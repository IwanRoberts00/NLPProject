<ICE-SIN:S2A-011#1:1:A>
And as he Julius Uvay who will come up for his third attempt at
one point eight metres

<ICE-SIN:S2A-011#2:1:A>
Make or break time for the Indonesian

<ICE-SIN:S2A-011#3:1:A>
Once he clears this height it will give him a psychological
advantage of uh on Deakin who also has to clear this in his attempt

<ICE-SIN:S2A-011#4:1:A>
Last and final attempt for Julius Uvay at one point eight metres and
he is out

<ICE-SIN:S2A-011#5:1:A>
He will go out with uh having achieved a height of one point seven
seven metres in the high jump discipline in the Decathlon event so quite a
good showing by Julius considering that he was struggling and at the earlier
jumps

<ICE-SIN:S2A-011#6:1:A>
He actually ended up with uh one point seven seven metres could be
quite happy with that

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-011#7:1:B>
<unclear> word </unclear>

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-011#8:1:A>
Well they have got the whole day ahead so maybe that explains
why

<ICE-SIN:S2A-011#9:1:A>
And Deakin if he clears this it would mean that most possibly he
will take the lead in the high or rather de Decathlete

<ICE-SIN:S2A-011#10:1:A>
But if he he fails to then Julius Uvay will still remain the leader
after four disciplines but that again depending on how well Domingo Kappal
fares

<ICE-SIN:S2A-011#11:1:A>
Domingo has of course after the skip this height and uh gone onto
one point eight three which will be the next type at Dimosius will have to
clear but first he has to get over this huddle

<ICE-SIN:S2A-011#12:1:A>
Nope he is also out and he is credited with the height of one point
seven seven metres that means Julius Uvay is certainly a happy man because he
knows for a fact that he will maintain the same five point lead over his
compatriot after the high jump discipline

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-011#13:1:B>
<unclear> word </unclear>

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-011#14:1:A>
But I just he was a demoralised man ever since he just failed
to clear this height on his attempt for his next two attempts were really a
catastrophe according to his standards

<ICE-SIN:S2A-011#15:1:A>
So the power has been raised again this time to one point eight
three metres the two Indonesians as we had sus suspected before the start of
the high jump Elfee knocked out very early

<ICE-SIN:S2A-011#16:1:A>
They are throwers and runners than jumpers

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-011#17:1:B>
<unclear> word </unclear>

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-011#18:1:A>
But we will take a break from the high jump for the the the
Decatheletics to uh witness another victory ceremony this time in the Women's
Marathon and here is the winner

<ICE-SIN:S2A-011#19:1:A>
She will go up and step up to receive that gold medal

<ICE-SIN:S2A-011#20:1:A>
Another one for Indonesia

<ICE-SIN:S2A-011#21:1:A>
A second gold medal in athletics this time going to Suriati Marijar
with the time of two hours fifty point five minute and she still look very
fresh after crossing that finish line

<ICE-SIN:S2A-011#22:1:A>
Two events gone and already four medals for Indonesia two golds one
silver and a bronze

<ICE-SIN:S2A-011#23:1:A>
So the second Indonesian we see and right after that the Indonesian
flag will be raised again

<ICE-SIN:S2A-011#24:1:A>
Congratulations indeed to Suriati Marijar who did ever so well

<ICE-SIN:S2A-011#25:1:A>
She took the lead and she never relinquish that

<ICE-SIN:S2A-011#26:1:A>
A very good run indeed by the Indonesian

<ICE-SIN:S2A-011#27:1:A>
The time of two hours fifty point five minutes winning her a gold
medal around her neck at the moment

<ICE-SIN:S2A-011#28:1:A>
A proud moment for Singapore next

<ICE-SIN:S2A-011#29:1:A>
Met with a big approval of course and they is not so many fans we
have here at the National Stadium

<ICE-SIN:S2A-011#30:1:A>
They got tonight so their voices loud enough to cheer Toh Soh Liang
that's a silver medal for her and our first medal in the athletics
competition <unclear> word </unclear> with Indonesia's fourth medal a bronze
in the women's marathon

<ICE-SIN:S2A-011#31:1:A>
So the Indonesians have certainly had a very good start to first
day of competition

<ICE-SIN:S2A-011#32:1:A>
Oh he uh like the clothes worn by our ladies carrying medals at the
moment just behind our medal winners

<ICE-SIN:S2A-011#33:1:A>
Clothes designed by Esther Tay

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-011#34:1:A>
So another gold medal for Indonesia

<ICE-SIN:S2A-011#35:1:A>
The two golds distributed already and shortly after that we will
have the victory ceremony for the <unclear> word </unclear>

<ICE-SIN:S2A-011#36:1:A>
That is confirmation of the results Suriati Marijah Indonesia first
Singapore Toh Soh Liang Indonesia's Mariahlo Alatah and uh tying the rest of
the positions Wynwyn Miang of Myanmar Hasiniah Sadaray of Philippines
<unclear> word </unclear> of Thailand and Aiai of Myanmar

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-011#37:1:B>
<unclear> word </unclear>

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-011#38:1:A>
Of course confirmation of the men's results as well

<ICE-SIN:S2A-011#39:1:A>
Uh <unclear> word </unclear> ceremony which we witnessed earlier on
Nike Saridah Sagalah of Indonesia winning it Indelor <unclear> word
</unclear> Wahidi also of Indonesia in second place and third place Jirad
Tikana Uma of Thailand Roy Vance of Philippines Thailand Thawit Dawonswee
Singapore's Tan Choon Gee and Myanmar's Mong Mong Tar in the other positions
from the fourth to seventh respectively

<ICE-SIN:S2A-011#40:1:A>
But for the gold medallist of course a big party all the way till
the end of the game and they will be enjoying themselves even more

<ICE-SIN:S2A-011#41:1:A>
Indonesians have brought a a real strong contingent here

<ICE-SIN:S2A-011#42:1:A>
You see them just in front of us just below us in the commentary
room cheering the team on

<ICE-SIN:S2A-011#43:1:A>
But their decathletics have uh been knocked out of the high jump
discipline and a good jump by Domingo Kappal who has skipped the the earlier
height of one point eight metres and once again he is crossing that bar so
easily that height of one point eight three metres

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-011#44:1:B>
<unclear> word </unclear>

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-011#45:1:A>
And with this discipline he might even close the gap between
uh him and the two Indonesians

<ICE-SIN:S2A-011#46:1:A>
Of course the points coming about from uh the height achieved the
high jump and not the placings

<ICE-SIN:S2A-011#47:1:A>
Still at one point eight three metres Leonardo Orbligado of the
Philippines who did very well to go pass one point eight metres

<ICE-SIN:S2A-011#48:1:A>
This will be a more difficult height for him

<ICE-SIN:S2A-011#49:1:A>
Yeh just failed to clear it

<ICE-SIN:S2A-011#50:1:A>
He just sailed over the bar over one point eight and never looks
likely that he was going to go pass that height

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-011#51:1:B>
<unclear> word </unclear>

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-011#52:1:A>
So the twenty-two year old Filipino will have to try again at
one point eight three metres

<ICE-SIN:S2A-011#53:1:A>
The two Bruneians doing very well still in the competition in the
high jump leg of the decathelin

<ICE-SIN:S2A-011#54:1:A>
Salmon Segar despite having some trouble at one point seven seven
metres and has found himself in good stead now at one point eight three
metres

<ICE-SIN:S2A-011#55:1:A>
Now a horrible jump there

<ICE-SIN:S2A-011#56:1:A>
The takeoff was totally wrong and he knew it all the way

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-011#57:1:B>
<unclear> word </unclear>

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-011#58:1:A>
His takeoff was certainly too near and uh it is all back to
square on again for him

<ICE-SIN:S2A-011#59:1:A>
He has got trouble at one point eight three

<ICE-SIN:S2A-011#60:1:A>
Leonardo is he gonna leap over his limitations now

<ICE-SIN:S2A-011#61:1:A>
Interesting in the uh decathelin high jump especially since you
joined us uh a two leaders have failed to go pass one point seven seven
metres and that is the unheralded athletics at the moment who are dominating

<ICE-SIN:S2A-011#62:1:A>
Well before Leondardo Orbligado will try to jump and clear one
point eight three metres and we have to sort out some height problems here we
will have to go for a commercial break

<ICE-SIN:S2A-011#63:1:A>
We will join you later </I>


<I>

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-011#64:2:C>
So they have a very good streak running into the seventeenth
SEA Games in Singapore in the Women's four hundred metres final and the
defending SEA Games champion is in this first semi-final Ludang Arpinpu

<$D> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-011#65:2:D>
<unclear> word </unclear>

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-011#66:2:C>
Once again checking on the line up again Ravia Abdul Salam of
Brunei of Malaysia lane two Alina Genosa of Philippines in lane three and
lane number four Kin Mar Que of Myanmar Ludang Pinpu of Thailand the uh
defending SEA Games champion and also the record holder at the South East
Asia at the Women's four hundred metres is in lane number five and in lane
number Noor Hanani of Brunei <unclear> word </unclear> outsider but still
could shock

<ICE-SIN:S2A-011#67:2:C>
The first three and the fastest two losers will qualify for the
final tomorrow

<ICE-SIN:S2A-011#68:2:C>
Finally it is a clean start and a very good takeoff by the Thai who
has overtaken the Bruneian ladies straight away

<ICE-SIN:S2A-011#69:2:C>
Ludang Pinpu she wouldn't wanna assert and release her strength so
much today save it more for the final tomorrow

<ICE-SIN:S2A-011#70:2:C>
She is a hot favourite to win her second consecutive SEA Games gold
medal and straight away we can see only one clear runner in this four hundred
metres first semi-final for the women's

<ICE-SIN:S2A-011#71:2:C>
She knows that she is uh relax a little bit coming into the final
hundred metres chased only by Malaysia's Ravia Abdul Salam

<ICE-SIN:S2A-011#72:2:C>
But it is uh Ludang Pinpu all the way easing up knowing that all
energy would be needed for tomorrow's final

<ICE-SIN:S2A-011#73:2:C>
Fifty-six seconds the time Malaysia's uh Ravia Salam comes in in
second place

<ICE-SIN:S2A-011#74:2:C>
In third place Philippines Alina Genosa

<ICE-SIN:S2A-011#75:2:C>
In fourth place Kin Mar Que of Myanmar and in uh fifth place Noor
Hanani of Brunei who has overtaken almost instantly when the gun went off

<$D> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-011#76:2:D>
<unclear> word </unclear>

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-011#77:2:C>
She has just striding to the finish line

<ICE-SIN:S2A-011#78:2:C>
It has been rounded to uh fifty-nine point nine seconds her time
for the first semi-final way outside her record of fifty-three point point
four four seconds

<ICE-SIN:S2A-011#79:2:C>
But she will be gunning for that only in the final and she has
certainly qualify for it with this easy run in the first semi-final

<ICE-SIN:S2A-011#80:2:C>
There you are no expression on the face at all just getting on with
the job and qualifying for the big race

<$D> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-011#81:2:D>
<unclear> word </unclear>

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-011#82:2:C>
So Ludang Pinpu is in good form and she has qualified for the
four hundred metres final for uh women and her closest rival in the next
semi-final Perla Balatulan of the Phillipines and Rama Chandran Shanti of
Malaysia

<ICE-SIN:S2A-011#83:2:C>
And there are three the first three to qualify and the two fastest
losers will make it to the final

<ICE-SIN:S2A-011#84:2:C>
Altogether only nine competitors taking part in the four hundred
metres race so only one of them will be left out of the final

<ICE-SIN:S2A-011#85:2:C>
And with the the Bruneian lady returning a very poor time I am sure
the next four ladies in the next semi-final will just have to go through the
pace and run through it to qualify for it

<ICE-SIN:S2A-011#86:2:C>
Uh we have the line up for semi-final number two in the four
hundred metres women

<ICE-SIN:S2A-011#87:2:C>
Rama Chandran Shanti of Malaysia in lane three Philippines Perla
Balatulan in lane four Thailand's uh Salirad Srimake in lane five and
Brunei's Masita Kaymatjumat in lane number six

<ICE-SIN:S2A-011#88:2:C>
Four lanes taken up only

<ICE-SIN:S2A-011#89:2:C>
Malaysia's G Shanti

<ICE-SIN:S2A-011#90:2:C>
Here is the lady who might pose some problems for Nudang Pinpu
<unclear> word </unclear> reputed to be in very good form for the four
hundred metres Perla Balatulan

<ICE-SIN:S2A-011#91:2:C>
Thailand's other four hundred metres runner Salirad Srimake of
course the Thais are well-known for producing great runners in their sprints
from a hundred to the four and Masita Kaymatjumat of Brunei taking up lane
number eight

<$D> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-011#92:2:D>
<unclear> word </unclear>

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-011#93:2:C>
And while we are waiting the start let me tell you that the
high jump for decathlon for men

<ICE-SIN:S2A-011#94:2:C>
The Bruneian athlete Domingo Kappal has cleared one point eight
nine metres Leonardo Orbligardo of the Phillipines is next

<ICE-SIN:S2A-011#95:2:C>
But now we await the start of the women's four hundred metres
semi-final number two

<ICE-SIN:S2A-011#96:2:C>
A very good start by the Thai athlete once again and straight away
she has overtaken Mari Masita Kaymatjumat of Brunei

<ICE-SIN:S2A-011#97:2:C>
Salirad Srimake with a nice lead closely chased by uh Perla
Balatulan of Phillipines and Malaysia's uh Shanti is making up some ground as
well but it is the Thai athlete going all the way by herself now

<ICE-SIN:S2A-011#98:2:C>
Here is another one Thai race

<ICE-SIN:S2A-011#99:2:C>
She will come into the last hundred metres all on her own and
Shanti and Balatulan who have been reputed to be in good form

<ICE-SIN:S2A-011#100:2:C>
But she is not really showing it at this semi-final but Salirad
Srimake is and she is coasting home

<ICE-SIN:S2A-011#101:2:C>
Can she beat fifty-five point nine nine seconds

<ICE-SIN:S2A-011#102:2:C>
Yes it is a much better time than uh her compatriot Ludang Pinpu
in the first semi-first final fifty-five point eight one seconds

<ICE-SIN:S2A-011#103:2:C>
Coming in second Raman Chandran Shanti of Malaysia and in third
place Salirad Srimate of Thailand

<ICE-SIN:S2A-011#104:2:C>
So a good time for the Thai Salirad Srimate

<ICE-SIN:S2A-011#105:2:C>
We will come back in a short while but first we will go back to
the studios and pause for some commercial break </I>
