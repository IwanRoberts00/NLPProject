<ICE-SIN:W2F-014#1:1>
<h> EIGHT YEARS TOO LATE </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2F-014#2:1>
I HAD never dreamt I would ever return again, like a repentant little
boy who discovered that camping out under the starry sky was actually a damp
and eerie experience.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-014#3:1>
Inconvenience and loneliness, but mostly loneliness, made me think of
home.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-014#4:1>
I longed for the curry chicken which Lian Ying used to make every
Tuesday; how I loved those huge pieces of meat, tender and cooked to a
perfect spiciness.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-014#5:1>
I wanted to taste again the delicious ginseng soup, brewed for hours
to extract the magical goodness of that mystical herb.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-014#6:1>
I missed the steaming tub of water which used to wait for me at the
end of a long exhausting day.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-014#7:1>
It was a wet August morning while sitting alone at my usual table in
Ah Tong's coffee-shop in China Street that I suddenly felt an enormous sense
of loss and I knew that it was time for me to go home.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-014#8:1>
I had been there for about three hours, sipping cup after cup of milky
tea and munching groundnuts.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-014#9:1>
The shop looked shabbier and more dreary than ever and the cracked
marble table was cold to the touch.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-014#10:1>
After the last of the morning crowd had left, Ah Tong came and sat
down with me.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-014#11:1>
He was a hefty fellow with a pock-marked face and irregular, stained,
dirty, yellow, brown and black teeth.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-014#12:1>
His hair, streaked with grey and white, hung stiffly and his
bloodshot eyes darted around like frightened little rabbits.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-014#13:1>
He was my only friend.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-014#14:1>
" I'm going home," I said He looked at me, surprised.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-014#15:1>
Perhaps it was the emotional tone of my voice which told him that
this time, I meant going home to my family and not to that rented little room
above the video shop.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-014#16:1>
Home, I thought with bitter irony.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-014#17:1>
" Home?" he asked.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-014#18:1>
I thought of the room which had been my home for the past few months.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-014#19:1>
It was my latest find and cost me eight dollars a day.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-014#20:1>
I had shifted so many times in the past eight years that I had
stopped counting.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-014#21:1>
On hot nights, the room would buzz with fierce mosquitoes and all
kinds of noisy insects.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-014#22:1>
When it rained, water leaked in through the cracks between the window
frames and the wall where pieces of concrete and bricks had fallen off.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-014#23:1>
It made the wooden floor wet and filled air with dankness.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-014#24:1>
" Yes, I think I have to go home," I said firmly.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-014#25:1>
He looked at me with a sort of contemptuous sympathy mixed with a
little admiration.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-014#26:1>
" It's your choice." He stood up and limped to the enormous counter
where a row of huge glass bottles always stood.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-014#27:1>
Children visiting the shop would buy Chinese biscuits and pastries in
these containers and parents seldom left without buying some.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-014#28:1>
Ah Tong's bad left leg was the result of a stray shrapnel which
pierced through the kneecap, shattering it like a fragile glass ornament and
leaving millions of pieces of broken bones lodged in the surrounding flesh.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-014#29:1>
Anaesthetists were scarce in those days so the doctor had dug the
pieces out amidst his agonising screams right in the middle of the crazy war.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-014#30:1>
Ah Tong was not much of a talker.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-014#31:1>
He told me the story only once but I could neither forget the
anguished look on his face nor the pure terror in his eyes, nor the way he
had shuddered at the memories that still haunted him.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-014#32:1>
He brought a pack of cards from the drawer where he kept his ledgers.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-014#33:1>
" A game?" " Sure," I said.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-014#34:1>
I wondered if it would be our last.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-014#35:1>
I finished the remaining groundnuts, dusted my shirt and threw the
shells into the chamber-pot under the table.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-014#36:1>
Ah Tong sat down opposite me and took out a squashed packet of
cigarettes.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-014#37:1>
He offered one to me.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-014#38:1>
" She'll be surprised." He spoke with a cigarette held between his
lips.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-014#39:1>
I shrugged.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-014#40:1>
Lian Ying was seldom surprised by anything.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-014#41:1>
She had a unnerving calmness about her that sometimes offended me.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-014#42:1>
I was a rather jumpy sort of person.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-014#43:1>
We played three games of bridge before I finally told myself I had to
go immediately or my nerves would fail me and I would never even dare to
think of going home again.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-014#44:1>
What if Lian Ying were to slam the door in my face?

<ICE-SIN:W2F-014#45:1>
That would be the ultimate shame, but somehow, I knew she would never
do that.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-014#46:1>
She was not the spiteful sort.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-014#47:1>
Perhaps that was why I had decided to return.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-014#48:1>
Perhaps I still loved her.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-014#49:1>
Perhaps I needed her.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-014#50:1>
" I must get going," I said Ah Tong gathered the heap of cards and
seemed engrossed in arranging it.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-014#51:1>
" Maybe I'll see you again sometime." " Sure.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-014#52:1>
I'll be around.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-014#53:1>
You'll see me." He turned away and threw the pack of cards onto the
counter.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-014#54:1>
Then he stood up and went to the door leading to the wash-room
behind.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-014#55:1>
I caught a glimpse of his face and thought I saw a pained expression
in his eyes.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-014#56:1>
He looked like he was going to cry.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-014#57:1>
What a shame, I said to myself, but at the same time I was pleased
and felt infinitely important and wonderful.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-014#58:1>
A strange sense of love flooded the inside of me.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-014#59:1>
At least someone was sorry to see me leave.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-014#60:1>
There were three cigarettes left in the box.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-014#61:1>
I took one and lighted it.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-014#62:1>
Then I took out a ten-dollar note and stuffed it in with the
remaining cigarettes.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-014#63:1>
I waited another five minutes, puffing rings of smoke expertly up to
the ceiling but Ah Tong did not appear.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-014#64:1>
Finally, I stubbed the cigarette out in the bright blue aluminium ash
tray and left the shop.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-014#65:1>
On the way, I stopped at Lau Fatt Kee, a famous Chinese pastry shop,
and bought a steamed pork bun, four egg tarts and four fried yam puffs.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-014#66:1>
I thought of my son, Tien De, who was a very intelligent boy.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-014#67:1>
He would be turning fifteen the following month.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-014#68:1>
I missed him.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-014#69:1>
The imminent encounter made me nervous and suddenly, I felt hungry.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-014#70:1>
As I got onto the bus, I started on the pork bun.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-014#71:1>
When the bus reached that familiar street where I had had my home for
seven years, I stumbled off hurriedly.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-014#72:1>
I sat down on one of the seats although it was wet, and tried to calm
down.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-014#73:1>
My heart was palpitating.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-014#74:1>
I ate two of the yam puffs and tried to stop my hands from shaking.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-014#75:1>
Perhaps that was a sign of my sincerity.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-014#76:1>
Yes, perhaps I longed for my family.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-014#77:1>
Yes, perhaps I really wanted to go home.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-014#78:1>
Clouds had begun to gather again and hung threateningly low in the
sky.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-014#79:1>
I had to wait for another few minutes before I built up enough
courage to get up and cross the street.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-014#80:1>
I was finally going home.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-014#81:1>
I had not seen them for eight years.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-014#82:1>
I wondered if my son still remembered me.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-014#83:1>
He had been only seven when I left.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-014#84:1>
During all those years in between, I had not really bothered to find
out anything or to visit.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-014#85:1>
Had I been busy?

<ICE-SIN:W2F-014#86:1>
I never had very much to do anyway except to go out for a nightly
drink at Ah Tong's, and occasionally relieve my physical needs with one or
two willing young ladies.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-014#87:1>
I stood outside the dark panelled door, my forefinger poised in
mid-air ready to press the door-bell.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-014#88:1>
I hesitated.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-014#89:1>
Thousands of frightening images played through my mind.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-014#90:1>
Would they take me back again?

<ICE-SIN:W2F-014#91:1>
Would my son ever accept me as his father?

<ICE-SIN:W2F-014#92:1>
After all, I had never been around for him when he was growing up.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-014#93:1>
What right did I have to ask for anything of him or his mother?

<ICE-SIN:W2F-014#94:1>
Finally, I rang the bell.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-014#95:1>
A low melodious tune sounded softened by the thickness of the door,
and I stood waiting, the paper-bag with the tidbits still in my hand.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-014#96:1>
" Who's that?" The sound of her voice hit me like a wave.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-014#97:1>
It had been a long time.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-014#98:1>
Too long.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-014#99:1>
Her voice was not as shrill as I remembered; there was now a softer,
subtler edge to it.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-014#100:1>
I thought to myself how sweet it sounded and then grieved at my own
sentimentality.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-014#101:1>
How I missed her.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-014#102:1>
In all the eight years we were separated, I had never admitted it.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-014#103:1>
Not even to myself.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-014#104:1>
It would have been too painful.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-014#105:1>
It would have bruised my stupid male ego.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-014#106:1>
A man who wanted to enjoy freedom had to give it up for some of the
things that family offered.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-014#107:1>
I had had my share of freedom.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-014#108:1>
Lian Ying had always been good to me.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-014#109:1>
I knew that.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-014#110:1>
I just did not realise how good.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-014#111:1>
Her love was generous, unlike me.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-014#112:1>
So how was I suppose to answer?

<ICE-SIN:W2F-014#113:1>
Again, I hesitated.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-014#114:1>
" Who's that?" " Ah Ying..." I stopped.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-014#115:1>
The seconds seemed to drag on forever.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-014#116:1>
In that eternity, I recalled the birth of our son and the radiant
look of joy on her face as the nurse placed the tiny bawling bundle into her
arms.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-014#117:1>
I remembered that exhilarating sense of pride I had felt as I held
the frail little creature, still bright red from the trauma of coming into
this world.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-014#118:1>
I saw again the excitement that had made her face glow when I
suggested having a family portrait taken at the Broadway Photo Studio, one of
the most famous in those days.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-014#119:1>
Little fragments of the most insignificant things in our lives
danced in my head.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-014#120:1>
Such precious memories.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-014#121:1>
The door swung open slowly.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-014#122:1>
She seemed to have changed very little.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-014#123:1>
She wore her air short now, a boyish cut which suited her well.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-014#124:1>
" Is that really you, Ah Hung?" She stared at me for a moment,
incredulous.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-014#125:1>
And then, recovering quickly from the shock, she smiled and invited
me in.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-014#126:1>
" Ah Tien is not back from school yet.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-014#127:1>
I'll get you a cup of tea.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-014#128:1>
Sit down and make yourself comfortable." " Ah Ying..."

<ICE-SIN:W2F-014#129:1>
She turned towards me and our eyes met.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-014#130:1>
Millions of different thoughts ran through my mind.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-014#131:1>
Confused, I hastily handed her the paper bag I was holding.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-014#132:1>
" Here are some tidbits for you and Ah Tien," I said.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-014#133:1>
" I bought some of your favourite egg-tarts from Lau Fatt Kee.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-014#134:1>
I don't know what Ah Tien likes, really, so I got some yam puffs
too.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-014#135:1>
" Oh, you shouldn't have spent all the money." An awkward silence
fell between us.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-014#136:1>
I knew I had to tell her now.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-014#137:1>
I had to tell her how sorry I was to have abandoned them; how sorry
I was to have betrayed her love, our love; how sorry I was to have failed as
a husband to her and as a father to our son.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-014#138:1>
But I did not.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-014#139:1>
We made small talk.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-014#140:1>
Trivial matters.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-014#141:1>
She now had another job, she told me, as a marketing consultant with
a local firm.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-014#142:1>
Tien De was doing quite well in school, she said, but he had
asthmatic attacks and so could not participate in many sporting activities.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-014#143:1>
He went for violin lessons twice a week, he was crazy about cars and
collected coins.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-014#144:1>
He liked mango ice-cream and peanut-butter, and hated steamed
chicken and carrots.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-014#145:1>
I told her about my eight years, the little incidents, the
occasional events.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-014#146:1>
She invited me to stay and I accepted.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-014#147:1>
Nothing was mentioned about the hurt and the betrayal.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-014#148:1>
I did not ask for forgiveness.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-014#149:1>
She did not accuse me of unfaithfulness.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-014#150:1>
We spent the afternoon shopping.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-014#151:1>
In my haste, I had not brought any clothing with me so I bought a
new holdall, a Dr West toothbrush, a Philips shaver, a face towel, two
shirts, and a T-shirt and a pair of blue boxer shorts to sleep in.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-014#152:1>
That evening, I met my son.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-014#153:1>
Ah Ying was peeling some shallots and I was nibbling a piece of
peanut crunch when he bounced into the kitchen.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-014#154:1>
" Hi, Mom," he cried as he dropped his knapsack onto the kitchen
floor. <X>

<ICE-SIN:W2F-014#X155:1>
He stopped and looked at me curiously.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-014#X156:1>
" Hi," he said and smiled.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-014#X157:1>
~Hi," I greeted in return. by Carol Loh </X> </I>
