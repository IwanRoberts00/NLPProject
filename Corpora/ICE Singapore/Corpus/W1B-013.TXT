To understand what King Zi's view on what it is to be human, it is
imperative to first understand his view concerning " what is more in human
life than meets the eye".

<ICE-SIN:W1B-013#2:1>
Although it is undeniable that King Zi does not discuss about "
strange phenomena, violence, chaos and gods", King Zi does have a religious
conviction about " what is more".

<ICE-SIN:W1B-013#3:1>
He uncritically accept the traditional idea that Tian, or heaven, is
the source of all things, including human culture.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-013#4:1>
Tian is intrinsically benevolent; Tian cares for the people.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-013#5:1>
King Zi declares that 'Tian produced the te ( virtue) in me'.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-013#6:1>
In other words, te is the personal presence of Tian within.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-013#7:1>
Originally te was regarded as an inborn capacity possessed by the
rulers and shamans through which the behaviours of others could be
influenced.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-013#8:1>
But King Zi innovatively proclaims that everybody, both rulers and
commoners, has this te endowed by Tian and hence, everyone has the both the
capacity and responsibility to cultivate benevolence as Tian is benevolent.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-013#9:1>
As such, King Zi thinks that to be human is to be a man of benevolence
or as he calls it, a noble man ( in Mandarin).

<ICE-SIN:W1B-013#10:1>
Another metaphysical or religious conviction integral to King Xi's
world view is the metaphor of family.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-013#11:1>
King Xi, as a transmitter of ancient heritage, believes that the
whole world and all there is within, consist of a big family.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-013#12:1>
Tian is reminiscent to the more ancient notion of Shan Ti (
collective presence of ancestral spirits) and Tian cares for the people.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-013#13:1>
The emperor as the son of Tian is charged with the parenting role to
take care of the people.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-013#14:1>
So, another way of conceiving of being human is, for King Xi, to be a
responsible family member.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-013#15:1>
To be a man of benevolence and to be a family member are two sides of
the same coin.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-013#16:1>
Benevolence is an existential goal and it refers to the perfection of
human excellence.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-013#17:1>
Everyone is endowed by Tian the capacity to engage in ethical
cultivation but everyone is not therefore automatically man of benevolence.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-013#18:1>
Efforts, will, decision are all needed to be invoked to make the
inborn capacity or moral sensibility to flourish and attain human perfection
or benevolence.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-013#19:1>
The root of benevolence is Xiao ( filial piety).

<ICE-SIN:W1B-013#20:1>
This ordered family affection is a natural impulse.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-013#21:1>
When this impulse is consciously developed and cultivated, it has the
potential to develop into Jen ( benevolence).

<ICE-SIN:W1B-013#22:1>
However, beside this natural impulse.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-013#23:1>
There are other selfish impulse, if unchecked, might impede the
extension and development of the natural affection of Xiao.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-013#24:1>
So, discipline, effort and constant choice are all indispensable
ingredients in the process of ethical cultivation.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-013#25:1>
It is interesting to note that King Xi believe that the records of
the way of the ancient sage king provides the blueprint of how heaven ( Tian)
live and more in this world.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-013#26:1>
Through the ancient record, we can see that the chou-li ( Rites) are
the crystalisations of Tian's way which means that the former sage king had
somehow comprehended Tian's way and codified it.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-013#27:1>
Since Li is the blue-print of how Tian moves and lives in this world,
to revive the former way of the ancient sage king or rather, to order the
kingdom according to Tian's way, all that is needed is to perform the rites
according to the proper inner ethical attitudes or spirit.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-013#28:1>
However the ancient rites are not comprehensive enough, and I wonder
it would ever be, to provide definitive guidance to every daily mundane
decision.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-013#29:1>
This is where conscious rational thought come in.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-013#30:1>
King Xi thinks that it is imperative for every human to put the
interest of the whole above the self and do what is appropriate ( Mandarin
word).

<ICE-SIN:W1B-013#31:1>
According to King Xi, an individual's greatest responsibility, as Lao
Szu King rightly perceives, is not on one's success and failures which are
determined by Ming ( Heaven's decree) but on ethical cutivation.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-013#32:1>
King Zi unapologetically assumes that what distinguishes man from all
other things is man's inborn capacity to engage in ethical cultivation and it
is only appropriate ( or human) to devote one's whole life's energies in
ethical cultivation.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-013#33:1>
Lao Zi would not dispute that the natural order, which he calls Tao,
while King Xi calls Tian, is inherently good.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-013#34:1>
He also would concur that we should respect the way of the former
sage king.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-013#35:1>
But he disagree that man's greatest responsibility is to engage in
ethical cultivation.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-013#36:1>
He thinks that man's greatest responsibility is to return to the Tao
and the way to do it is to employ " non action" - actions without effort.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-013#37:1>
I hasten to add that although Tao Tzu's conception of " how" to
cultivate or perfect our being human is different from King Xi, both converge
on the point that human should live and move in the way of the natural order.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-013#38:1>
Tao Tzu also differs in his view concerning Li ( rites).

<ICE-SIN:W1B-013#39:1>
He accepts the way of the former sage king but he is skeptical about
the claim that it can be codified.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-013#40:1>
He regards the performance of Li not as irrelevant but even as
contrary to the interests of being human.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-013#41:1>
Furthermore, while King Xi encourages conscious rational thought in
discriminating the good from the bad, he asserts that one should make no
distinction and cease the wavering mind from having cognitive functions.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-013#42:1>
As for Chan, a buddhist, he would think that ethical cultivation is a
mere tool to prepare one to " see into one's buddha directly" and obviously,
he would say that this is just a secondary responsibility.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-013#43:1>
For Chan, the greatest responsibility of man is to attain
enlightenment which is also the extinguishing of selfish desires.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-013#44:1>
The second part of the above discussion focuses mainly on the
differences of the conceptions of how to perfect our being human according to
the 3 perspectives.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-013#45:1>
It does not mean that they have no similarity at all.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-013#46:1>
One salient similarity is the common believe that one needs to put
the interests of the whole, whether conceived of as Tian, Tao or SELF ( the
ultimate reality), above self and not to give free reign to selfish and
debased desires.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-013#47:1>
King Zi regards himself as a transmitter of ancient heritage and not
an innovator.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-013#48:1>
In this essay, I will elucidate the content of the ancient heritage,
he transmits and the way in which he has contributed his innovative insights
in this interpretations of the ancient heritage.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-013#49:1>
King Zi is a Ru scholar.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-013#50:1>
As a ru, he is well versed in the records of ancient heritage which
consist mainly, though not solely, of ancient rites and historical facts.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-013#51:1>
He is convinced that the reason why the former sage kings like Yao (
Mandarin) and Shun ( Mandarin) had brought peace and harmony to the kingdoms
was because they had somehow grasped the way of Tian; they had codified the
way of Tian and came out with a comprehensive set of rites which mirror how
Tian moves and lives in this world.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-013#52:1>
Since this rites have a metaphysical origin, they are natural in the
sense it has the power to humanize and shape those who participate in it, and
not artificial.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-013#53:1>
This is perhaps why Figarate calls these holy rites or sacred
ceremonies.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-013#54:1>
it is possible to argue that what is innovative about King Zi's view
is that he asserts that it is only through the cultivation of Jen that would
infuse the performance of Li with the required spirit and through which, the
Li would be enlivened and as a result, could radiate its spiritual power and
bring peace and harmony to the land.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-013#55:1>
However, as Benjamin Schwartz succinctly points out that even in some
of the preconfucian texts, the idea of " te" with an ethical connotation was
already present.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-013#56:1>
" Te" originally was believed to be a inborn capacity of the ruler.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-013#57:1>
If a ruler through ethical choice and effort makes his " te"
illustrious, then he would be able to receive the mandate to rule from
heaven.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-013#58:1>
So, it is evident that even before confucius, there was already the
belief that the performance of Li, especially by the ruler, needs to be
accompanied with the proper inner ethical attitude and spirit.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-013#59:1>
What is new about King Zi's idea, is that he extends the privilege of
ethical cultivation and the potential of achieving ethical perfection to the
commoners.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-013#60:1>
Before him, it was thought that " te" is the exclusive privilege of
the members of the ruling clan.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-013#61:1>
But King Zi audaciously assert that everyone can be a man of
benevolence and everyone has the inborn capacity and responsibility to engage
in ethical cultivation.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-013#62:1>
In fact, the notion of " noble man" ( in Mandarin) denotes only the
sons of rulers, but King Xi converts it into an ethical notion, that
represent an ethical ideal of human excellence of which all man should strive
for.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-013#63:1>
Another credit that King Xi deserves is that he gives the most detail
teachings of how to cultivate Jen, even until today.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-013#64:1>
Despite the fact that he gives no single exhaustive definition to
explicate Jen, he produces different numerations of how Jen should be
practised in different specific contexts.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-013#65:1>
In my opinion, King Xi greatest contribution lies with his careful
and in-depth teaching of how to practice Jen.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-013#66:1>
It is noteworthy that King Xi's notion of Jen is also new and yet
continuous with what came before.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-013#67:1>
Professor Lin Yu Sheng notes that the word " Jen" already appears in
" The book of poetry" which, perhaps means " true manhood".

<ICE-SIN:W1B-013#68:1>
What is unmistakable is that " Jen" originally refers only a
particular virtue.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-013#69:1>
But in King Xi's hands, he extends its meanings to encompass all
particular virtues.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-013#70:1>
As a result, for King Xi, Jen is a notion denoting the ultimate
perfection of human excellence.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-013#71:1>
As Schwartz observes, Jen became an existential goal that one should
constantly strive for though it seems that one never reaches.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-013#72:1>
I am aware that there are those who thinks that King Xi's greatest
innovation is his conception of Xi and Fingarette is a case in point.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-013#73:1>
In my view, this is factually erroneous.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-013#74:1>
In the first place, in King Xi's time, though there were neglect and
misapplication of Li, yet it is undeniable that on the whole, Li was still
widely practised since it is part of the ancient Chinese culture.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-013#75:1>
As Schwartz argues, King Xi expresses concern only when there is " a
discrepancy" between the form and the spirit of Li.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-013#76:1>
Moreover, as Waley rightly discerns the Analects do not focus on the
details of Li but if is a book which primarily focused on " the general
principles of moralities".

<ICE-SIN:W1B-013#77:1>
In conclusion, what is new and yet continuous with what came before
is King Xi's ideas that everybody has the capacity to cultivate Jen and it is
through the cultivation of Jen that Li could be enliven.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-013#78:1>
When Li is enliven, the former way of the ancient sage king would be
revived and its spiritual force would be unleased.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-013#79:1>
Without the accompaniment of Jen, Li would degenerate into empty
forms and this is what King Xi abhors.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-013#80:1>
A perfect man has no name, no achievement and no use.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-013#81:1>
A perfect man has no name because the Tao, the ultimate reality that
the perfect man gain mystical union with, has no name.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-013#82:1>
Names are used to refer to a particular thing or characteristic but
the Tao is all-embracing.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-013#83:1>
It is in everything and everything is in the Tao.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-013#84:1>
A perfect man has no achievement because like the Tao, he claims no
credit for himself.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-013#85:1>
He has no use or to be specific, he is useless because he does not
confine and subject himself to the artificial norms and man made standards.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-013#86:1>
A perfect man is also one who is not found by human limitations.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-013#87:1>
He could roam about in the universe and ride on the " normalities of
the six elements".

<ICE-SIN:W1B-013#88:1>
He is free and eternally happy.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-013#89:1>
Unplagued by negative human emotions, he has no worldly worries and
cares.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-013#90:1>
But what must one do to become a perfect man? <X>

<ICE-SIN:W1B-013#X91:1>
Zhuang Zi tells us: fast the mind.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-013#X92:1>
How?

<ICE-SIN:W1B-013#X93:1>
Transcend all finite points of view.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-013#X94:1>
Make no distinction.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-013#X95:1>
Don't affirm this or negate that for all is relative. </X> </I>
