<h> INTRODUCTION </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-035#6:1>
Over the years, technologies have been developed to increase
productivity of the various manufacturing functions.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-035#7:1>
These independent efforts have resulted in the various 'islands of
automation' such as: computer Aided Design ( CAD), Computer Aided
Manufacturing tCAM), Flexible Manufacturing Systems ( FMS), Manufacturing
Resource Planning ( MRP 11), Group Technology ( GT), Automated Materials
Handling ( AMH), Computer Aided Process Planning ( CAPP), Artificial
Intelligence ( Al), and others.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-035#8:1>
When properly planned, managed, and implemented, most of these systems
will prove beneficial to their specific areas of application.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-035#9:1>
But too often, manufacturers plunge into one or more of these
technologies without clear goals or long term plans.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-035#10:1>
This fragmented approach may produce incremental improvement to the
manufacturing efficiency.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-035#11:1>
However, the lack of a coordinated long term plan may result in
tremendous difficulty in integrating these various islands together.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-035#12:1>
Computer Integrated Manufacturing ( CIM) conceives manufacturing as a
series of integrated processes and provides a strategic framework for linking
these independent activities and information flow.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-035#13:1>
The goal of CIM is to achieve overall improvement in productivity of
the total manufacturing enterprise through integrating all its processes into
a coherent system.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-035#14:1>
A modular approach has to be adopted to ensure the success of CIM
implementation due to the complexity in both the technical and organizational
aspects.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-035#15:1>
An initial nucleus which allows gradual expansion by permitting
interaction between it and other system's databases has to be identified.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-035#16:1>
Manufacturing Resource Planning ( MRP 11), which supports operation
planning and execution, is best positioned to play this pivotal role.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-035#17:1>
An ideal candidate for integration with MRP 11 is Computer Aided
Design ( CAD) system.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-035#18:1>
The basis of integration is Part Master Record ( PMR) and Bills of
material ( BOM) information, which is essential to both systems.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-035#19:1>
This article outlines the common elements in CAD and MRP 11 systems,
discusses the benefits of sharing information in both systems, and the
requirements for integration.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-035#20:1>
This article also discusses the roles of CAD and MRP 11 systems in a
CIM framework, and suggests a method of integration through the use of a
generic interface that can easily hook onto any CAD or MRP II systems.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-035#21:1>
Finally the implementation of the methodology using Micro MAX MRP II
system and Micro CADAM CAD package is presented.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-035#22:1>
<h> A PROPOSED CIM ARCHITECTURE </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-035#23:1>
Figure 1 shows a proposed model of CIM architecture.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-035#24:1>
It consists of four basic components: Computer aided design ( CAD),
Computer Aided Process Planning ( CAPP), Computer Aided Manufacturing ( CAM)
and Manufacturing Resource Planning ( MRP 11)12.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-035#25:1>
CAD establishes the part descriptions in a database accessible to
other manufacturing functions, it serves as the design center of the whole
system; CAPP translates design data information into manufacturing data in
the form of process plan which includes selection of the appropriate
manufacturing process, sequencing of production operations, specifying and
acquiring tooling, detailing speeds and feeds, and estimating set-up and run
times.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-035#26:1>
CAM converts the product data into physical parts by producing
specific instructions for individual machines and controlling the machine
operations.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-035#27:1>
MRP 11 is playing the role of coordinating and monitoring all the
major functional areas of a manufacturing business, which is the natural 'hub'
of the CIM system.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-035#28:1>
<h> APPLICATION SYSTEMS - MR Il and CAD </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-035#29:1>
MRP II is a closed-loop material and production planning and control
system.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-035#30:1>
lt includes not only material planning concepts but production
resource planning and feedback loops that report actual results against the
plan.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-035#31:1>
MRP II provides a mechanism for checking the material plan against
manufacturing resources and for identifying problem areas as the plan is
executed [ 7].

<ICE-SIN:W2A-035#32:1>
Figure 2 shows the relationship between the planning and control
elements within MRP 11.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-035#33:1>
As illustrated, the shop floor control, purchasing and accounting
modules feed back actual results into the planning modules so that corrective
action can be taken as needed.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-035#34:1>
MRP II is an integrated system by itself, consisting of several
functional modules built upon a common database, and can serve as an
important information center of CIM .

<ICE-SIN:W2A-035#35:1>
The top management creates the strategic/business plan, which sets
the overall business objectives, including the goals for revenues.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-035#36:1>
The marketing/sales plan generates the independent demand in the form
of customer orders and/or sales forecasts.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-035#37:1>
The production plan provides key communication links from top
management to manufacturing.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-035#38:1>
It determines the basis for focusing the detailed production
resources to achieve the strategic objectives of the firm.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-035#39:1>
The production plan might be in dollars or aggregate units of output
per month.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-035#40:1>
The master production schedule ( MPS) projects the end-item
production requirements by time period ( normally a week) and specific end
item part numbers based on the production plan, sales forecast, customer
orders, and planned changes in the inventory levels of finished goods.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-035#41:1>
Master production schedule is a basic input to and driving force
behind the material requirements planning module.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-035#42:1>
MRP is considered as the key component of MRP 11, it translates gross
requirements for end items into time phased net requirements for
subassemblies and individual parts based on the MPS, product bills of
material, and current inventory status.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-035#43:1>
Gross requirements are obtained by " exploding the end item product
structure into its lower level requirements.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-035#44:1>
The exploding process is simply a multiplication of the number of end
items by the quantity of each component required to produce a single end
item.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-035#45:1>
The explosion identifies what components are required, as well as how
many, to produce a given quantity of end items.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-035#46:1>
By referring to the inventory status in the inventory control module,
the gross quantities will be netted by subtracting the available inventory
items.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-035#47:1>
The actual order quantity for an item may be adjusted to a suitable
lot size, or it may simply be the net requirement.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-035#48:1>
Just as important as " what" and " how many" is when.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-035#49:1>
MRP schedules time-phased orders by lead time offsetting.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-035#50:1>
For purchased components, the lead time is the time interval between
the placement of the purchase order and its availability in inventory.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-035#51:1>
For manufactured components, it is the interval between the release
of the work order and its completion.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-035#52:1>
The outputs of an MRP run are a series of purchase and manufacturing
orders, which then are handled and monitored separately by the purchasing and
shop floor control modules respectively.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-035#53:1>
Before the issue of manufacturing orders to the shop floor control
module, the capacity requirement planning module is executed first to
determine if MPS is feasible based on available manufacturing capacity.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-035#54:1>
Capacity planning determines how many persons, machines, and physical
resources are required to accomplish the tasks of production based on the
future manufactured-component requirements from MRP and released, in-process
manufacturing order information to develop a profile of production resource
usage.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-035#55:1>
Reports are produced showing projected production work center load
versus capacity.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-035#56:1>
The shop floor control module develops a production schedule for
manufacturing orders by using routing information.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-035#57:1>
It also controls manufacturing orders release to the shop floor and
tracks production order status through work centers.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-035#58:1>
The purchasing orders are firmed, released, and tracked by purchasing
module which also provides vendor performance information.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-035#59:1>
The accounting module supports accounts receivable, accounts payable,
general ledger, personnel and payroll, and other accounting functions.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-035#60:1>
Using inventory information and product cost data, the value of the
current inventory can be determined.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-035#61:1>
Using cost data, product structure, and routing information, the
manufactured cost of any item can be calculated.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-035#62:1>
Accounts payable is also coordinated with purchasing and receiving
and payroll is used to record labor costs with data from shop floor control.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-035#63:1>
Because of its integrated architecture and provision of a modular
capability for integration, MRP Il is best positioned to serve a vital link
between design and manufacturing within a Computer integrated manufacturing (
CIM) framework [ 5],[6],[7].

<ICE-SIN:W2A-035#64:1>
Computer aided design ( CAD) is the use of computers in interactive
engineering drawing and storage of designs.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-035#65:1>
Under operator direction via various interaction device and
programming techniques, the computer can complete a part's layout, geometric
transformations, projections, rotations, magnifications, and cross-section
views [ 31].

<ICE-SIN:W2A-035#66:1>
CAD assists the designer in conceptualising and detailing a part
design.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-035#67:1>
The role of CAD in CIM is to serve as the center for design
information for the entire organisation.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-035#68:1>
It translates design ideas into product data from which manufacturing
information can be generated.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-035#69:1>
CAD data can be divided into two categories: part
specification/product structure data and geometric/design data.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-035#70:1>
The part specification/product structure data represent much of the
same information maintained in the Bill of materials module of MRP 11,
whereas the geometric/design data is to be interfaced with computer aided
process planning ( CAPP) system.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-035#71:1>
FUNDAMENTAL SIMILAITIES OF CD AND MRP 11 SYSTEMS The common data
elements shared by CAD and MRP 11 systems are maintained in the Part Master
Record ( PMR) and Bill of Materials ( BOM).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-035#72:1>
In a MRP 11 system, PMR is the collection of basic information that
identifies and registers a part into the system's database.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-035#73:1>
It contains information needed for all the related modules in the MRP
1I system, which include purchasing, inventory control, material requirements
planning etc., such as:

<ICE-SIN:W2A-035#74:1>
Part identifier,

<ICE-SIN:W2A-035#75:1>
Part description,

<ICE-SIN:W2A-035#76:1>
Item number,

<ICE-SIN:W2A-035#77:1>
Process control code ( or part type code, make/buy code),

<ICE-SIN:W2A-035#78:1>
Unit of measure, - Drawing number, - Revision level,

<ICE-SIN:W2A-035#79:1>
- Engineering Change Notice ( ECN) number,

<ICE-SIN:W2A-035#80:1>
- Effectivity start/end dates,

<ICE-SIN:W2A-035#81:1>
- Supersedes part number,

<ICE-SIN:W2A-035#82:1>
- Superseded by part number,

<ICE-SIN:W2A-035#83:1>
- Standard cost.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-035#84:1>
Most of the PMR information are also maintained in the CAD system for
the purposes of documentation and classification of the design drawings.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-035#85:1>
A bill of materials ( BOM) is a list of the items, ingredients, or
materials needed to produce a parent item, end item, or product.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-035#86:1>
It can take several different forms and be used in many ways.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-035#87:1>
It may be a simple parts list, or structured to indicate how a
product is produced.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-035#88:1>
The BOM is called a product structure when it indicates how a product
will be produced, it contains information on all materials, components, or
sub assemblies required to produce each end item ( or master scheduled item [
5].

<ICE-SIN:W2A-035#89:1>
In the MRP II system, while the master production schedule plans how
much of each item must be available on particular dates to satisfy
independent demand, the product structure records are used to derive the
quantities of dependent components required to build the end items.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-035#90:1>
Moreover, the bill of materials is not just a simple listing of
dependent demand items, but a structured list which describes the sequence of
steps in manufacturing the product.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-035#91:1>
The product structure record contains the materials for the end item
in levels representing the way they are actually placed in the manufacturing
process.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-035#92:1>
Each level in the structure represents a distinct stage of the
overall manufacturing process: from the conversion of raw materials into
subassemblies at the lowest level, to the subsequent steps involved in
building assemblies, and lastly to the final assembly of the end item at the
highest level in the structure [ 5].

<ICE-SIN:W2A-035#93:1>
A typical product structure record may consist of the following data
holds:

<ICE-SIN:W2A-035#94:1>
- Parent part identifier,

<ICE-SIN:W2A-035#95:1>
- Component part identifier,

<ICE-SIN:W2A-035#96:1>
- Effectivity date,

<ICE-SIN:W2A-035#97:1>
- Quantity per assembly,

<ICE-SIN:W2A-035#98:1>
- Leadtime offset,

<ICE-SIN:W2A-035#99:1>
- Engineering Change Notice ( ECN) number,

<ICE-SIN:W2A-035#100:1>
- Alternate part identifier.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-035#101:1>
The product structure information of a part is defined by the CAD
system as the part is created.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-035#102:1>
It can only be extracted if the designer follows the methodology
recommended by the data extraction program.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-035#103:1>
<h> BENEFITS OF CAD-MRP II INTEGRATION </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-035#104:1>
Substantial benefits can be realized by accessing MRP 11 system data
during the process of product design using a CAD system.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-035#105:1>
In fact, several advantages can be obtained even without any formal
link between the two systems.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-035#106:1>
Information such as inventory and work-in-process levels, incoming
purchase orders, and cost data will facilitate the design process by helping
the engineer in making a better decision.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-035#107:1>
Access to MRP 11 data will also promote better communication between
engineering and manufacturing department by making engineers more cost
conscious.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-035#108:1>
For example, during the design change process, the engineer would be
able to access inventory, cost and pending order information about a
component before determining the change's effectivity date. <X>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-035#X109:1>
Even greater benefits can be obtained when CAD and MRP 11 systems
are integrated ' 1.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-035#X110:1>
When a part is released from a CAD system, the PMR and BOM
information will have to be manually entered into the MRP II system, along
with the required additional information ( eg Iead times, order policy,
min/max order quantity etc.).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-035#X111:1>
This manual transcription of data from CAD to MRP 11 is redundant
and time consuming, and up to 75% of the errors in product design can be
attributed to errors in such transmission [ 4].

<ICE-SIN:W2A-035#X112:1>
The problem will be aggravated in keeping track of the inevitable
engineering changes throughout a product's life cycle.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-035#X113:1>
Transcription errors will likely be increased at each step, due to
the need to enter and maintain data in each system independently. </X> </I>
