<I>

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#1:1:A>
Mister Yeoh can you tell the Court the nature of your work
experience

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#2:1:B>
I've been managing director of this company Technikem
laboratories Services for fourteen years

<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#3:1:B>
And we have been handling a lot of analyses a lot of laboratory
investigations and testings since incorporation in nineteen seventy seven

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#4:1:A>
Do you actually perform the laboratory tests

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#5:1:B>
Yes

<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#6:1:B>
I have a group of lab staff but for this particular instance I was
the one that I handled the whole thing

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#7:1:A>
Now tell us how much experience do you have in analysing paints
and thinners

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#8:1:B>
We don't analyse very many samples in paint but thinners yes as
a solvent

<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#9:1:B>
We do quite a number of analyses on thinners

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#10:1:A>
Is this the first occasion that you have been asked to analyse
a paint

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#11:1:B>
No

<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#12:1:B>
We did paint analysis before but not in this manner

<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#13:1:B>
Not in this manner

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#14:1:A>
But you have not analysed paints on many occasions is that
correct

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#15:1:B>
Yes it's not that many occasions

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#16:1:A>
Now you have said that you have not been asked to analyse a
paint in this manner

<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#17:1:A>
I believe you are referring to the manner in A B forty four

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#18:1:B>
I mean in this investigative manner

<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#19:1:B>
I was referring to this to carry out tests spray and this and that

<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#20:1:B>
This is not

<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#21:1:B>
We always analyse as a product

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#22:1:A>
So who suggested this method of testing for you

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#23:1:B>
It's between the discussion of myself and Mister Lee

<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#24:1:B>
Do you know whether Mister Lee is a chemistry expert

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#25:1:A>
No I don't know

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#26:1:B>
Now why then being a professional chemist uh did you have to
discuss the test method with Mister Lee

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#27:1:A>
Of course

<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#28:1:A>
Mister Lee is my principal in this instance

<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#29:1:A>
I have to discuss with him about the manner or what which I mean
it's a mutual it is a

<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#30:1:A>
He's my principal so I have to discuss with him

<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#31:1:A>
I just can't take a sample and do it myself in my own way without
his approval because he's paying the bill

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#32:1:A>
Now did Mister Lee ask you

<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#33:1:A>
What did Mister Lee tell you the objective of the test in A B forty
four

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#34:1:B>
Which one

<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#35:1:B>
You mean for these two reports

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#36:1:A>
Yes we'll start with forty four first

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#37:1:B>
Thirty four not thirty three

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#38:1:A>
Forty four first

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#39:1:B>
Forty four is the later one

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#40:1:A>
Never mind

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#41:1:B>
Okay

<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#42:1:B>
Yes I knew the background of the problem that he said

<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#43:1:B>
The paint applied on the acrylic board then to get cobwebs and peel
off and so on

<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#44:1:B>
I knew the background of the you know

<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#45:1:B>
The reason for doing the investigation

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#46:1:A>
Could you tell us in full your understanding of the background
to this problem

<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#47:1:A>
Tell us in detail

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#48:1:B>
As far as I understand from Mister Lee

<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#49:1:B>
That he showed me a sign of the Shell's logo

<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#50:1:B>
And that there was paint that already painted on the surface shows
signs of cracks

<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#51:1:B>
And I think one or two and I think one or two position had peeled
off

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#52:1:A>
Now therefore can you tell us what is the objective of your
report in A B forty four

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#53:1:B>
As what I mentioned earlier it's to simulate the way that they
applied the paint on the material

<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#54:1:B>
And see whether you have uh the same effect as what they have
observed earlier

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#55:1:A>
In other words the objective of your test was to recreate the
same result

<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#56:1:A>
Is that correct

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#57:1:B>
I don't say same result but just as an experiment to see
whether to simulate the actual way of application

<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#58:1:B>
And see whether we see what type of result to get that's all

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#59:1:A>
But your ultimate objective was to see whether the paint would
crack

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#60:1:B>
Yes

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#61:1:A>
Now was it your objective in this test in A B forty four to
find out the cause of cracking

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#62:1:B>
No

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#63:1:A>
In other words you would not be able to say anything about the
cause of the cracks is that

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#64:1:B>
Not in this particular report not the cause of the cracks

<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#65:1:B>
But it's an observation that's all

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#66:1:A>
I refer you now to this A B forty four the details of it

<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#67:1:A>
Alright at introduction line three you said by applying various
Kansai coloured paints diluted with plat top thinner

<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#68:1:A>
What coloured paints were these

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#69:1:B>
All sorts of colours

<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#70:1:B>
White yellow red black

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#71:1:A>
Four colours five colours

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#72:1:B>
Well one two three four

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#73:1:A>
And you diluted these paints only with plat top number eleven

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#74:1:B>
I didn't dilute

<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#75:1:B>
It was if you read the report

<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#76:1:B>
It was diluted by the well by the workers when I was there

<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#77:1:B>
That is stated in my report

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#78:1:A>
Where does it say

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#79:1:B>
It said diluted with plat top thinners on clean acrylic boards
with the help of Mister Lee Ah Yong of Comsign and his technicians

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#80:1:A>
In other words these paints samples were diluted

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#81:1:B>
In front of me during my presence

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#82:1:A>
By Comsign officers

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#83:1:B>
Yes

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#84:1:A>
In your presence

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#85:1:B>
Yes

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#86:1:A>
Now Mister Yeoh are you able to comment whether the dilution
by these officers of Comsign is a proper one

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#87:1:B>
Proper in what sense

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#88:1:A>
Suitable for application

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#89:1:B>
Well I put it again in my application

<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#90:1:B>
The paint on the third paragraph the paint was then diluted with a
thinner to a certain degree which by the opinion of Mister Lee was suitable
for spraying

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#91:1:A>
In other words Mister Yeoh on the question of dilution you
left it to the opinion of Mister Lee

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#92:1:B>
Yes

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#93:1:A>
As to what was suitable

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#94:1:B>
Uhm I think can I make a comment on that

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#95:1:A>
Yes sure

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#96:1:B>
Because I think they because they are using a sprayer so they
are the one who knows best how dilute or how viscous the paint should be for
their own sprayer

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#97:1:A>
Yes but Mister Yeoh would you not agree that if a paint is
excessively or under diluted it would have unsatisfactory effects on the
outcome of the paint work

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#98:1:B>
Can you just repeat it please

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#99:1:A>
If someone were to over dilute the paint would that not affect
the result

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#100:1:B>
Well I think if a paint is over diluted you will find that it
would not be able to stick on as good as what it

<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#101:1:B>
There is a certain percentage that you have to mix and you can't
be too dilute because it would not stay

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#102:1:A>
It would crack

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#103:1:B>
I don't know whether it will crack or or

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#104:1:A>
It will peel off

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#105:1:B>
Probably even when it dry off

<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#106:1:B>
Probably everything will be gone because if it's too dilute

<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#107:1:B>
That means you

<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#108:1:B>
I'm not too sure how I can put it to you but in my opinion is you
have to have a certain degree of mixing before you can make the paint stays

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#109:1:A>
Okay Mister Yeoh in other words there is a correct proportion
of dilution of paints

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#110:1:B>
Yes

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#111:1:A>
And if you were to over dilute the result would be
unsatisfactory

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#112:1:B>
Well it will be generally unsatisfactory

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#113:1:A>
And yet Mister Yeoh in this test on the question of the
suitable dilution of paints you left it to Mister Lee or his workers

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#114:1:B>
Yes I mean the reason I explained earlier that they supposed
to know best that what is the concentration required for their sprayer

<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#115:1:B>
Because if you have too concentrated you may find problem to spray
out

<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#116:1:B>
If too dilute also you will be you know flying all over the place

<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#117:1:B>
So I presume that they have been doing this job for years

<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#118:1:B>
They should know what is the best

<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#119:1:B>
That's why I put in in their opinion you know

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#120:1:A>
I asks you again Mister Yeoh do you agree that if you were to
over dilute or under dilute a paint plastic paint it may cause cracking of
the paint cracking or peeling

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#121:1:B>
I would not comment on that no

<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#122:1:B>
But I would imagine that in fact in the first place if you

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#123:1:A>
No sorry sorry you are not able to comment or you will not
comment on that

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#124:1:B>
I would not be able to comment

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#125:1:A>
But you agree that there is a suitable range of dilution

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#126:1:B>
Yes

<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#127:1:B>
May I add

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#128:1:A>
Yes

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#129:1:B>
In my opinion the paint that appears here the painted surface
in my opinion is reasonable in the sense that it's not a diluted over diluted
type of paint that is to stick on this <X>

<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#X130:1:B>
Chief Justice: Can you repeat that please </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#131:1:B>
No in my opinion this particular for this particular sample
these two samples

<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#132:1:B>
I think it has been properly applied with suitable amount of paint
there is not the over diluted paint

<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#133:1:B>
That's what you like to put it to me just now

<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#134:1:B>
Because we can see the paint it is not a thin paint

<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#135:1:B>
It is not a thin paint work

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#136:1:A>
I'll come back to that later Mister Yeoh when you say you
conduct a test under experimental conditions

<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#137:1:A>
Should not you or your laboratory staff be conducting every aspect
of the test

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#138:1:B>
No it's not necessary This is not the first instance that we
carry out investigation in this manner

<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#139:1:B>
It is not necessary that we have to do from A to Z

<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#140:1:B>
In fact we leave it to whoever who knows best to do it but of
course to our own satisfaction

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#141:1:A>
Next paragraph

<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#142:1:A>
The acrylic boards used were fresh from stock

<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#143:1:A>
What do you mean by that

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#144:1:B>
Yes because it was taken out from a wrapping

<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#145:1:B>
In my opinion it is fresh

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#146:1:A>
Now what size and shape is this

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#147:1:B>
This is a for this particular one all this are original shape

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#148:1:A>
Now did you examine the boards with the cracked paint

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#149:1:B>
Which board which board you're talking about

<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#150:1:B>
You're talking about this sample or you're talking

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#151:1:A>
No the boards that were painted by the Plaintiffs

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#152:1:B>
You mean the signboard you're talking about

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#153:1:A>
Yes

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#154:1:B>
Yes I saw the signboard myself

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#155:1:A>
Did you examine them

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#156:1:B>
Yes

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#157:1:A>
Are these the ones with the Shell logo

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#158:1:B>
Sorry

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#159:1:A>
Are these the ones with the Shell logo

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#160:1:B>
Yes with the Shell logo

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#161:1:A>
Now are the cracks that appeared in your experiment of the
same nature as the ones that were painted by Plaintiffs

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#162:1:B>
Similar the cracks look similar

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#163:1:A>
Are you satisfied that the cracks in the experiment and on
the boards painted by the Plaintiffs were caused by the same cause

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#164:1:B>
I have no comment on what

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#165:1:A>
You have no comment

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#166:1:B>
No I have no comment on that

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#167:1:A>
And under Observations second paragraph second line you said
it could not be confirmed if the acrylic board had been affected as well as
removal of paint by a solvent could tarnish the acrylic surface

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#168:1:B>
Yes

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#169:1:A>
Can you explain this

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#170:1:B>
What really we meant in this report was we saw the cracks

<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#171:1:B>
Okay this is on a applied surface and this is a unapplied surface
and now you read the cracks from this end from the unapplied surface and you
can see the cracks you can see the cracks

<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#172:1:B>
If you like we have to like to show to the Lord <X>

<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#X173:1:B>
Chief Justice: These are the cobweb-like cracks </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#174:1:B>
Yes Yes that's how the

<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#175:1:B>
So by these observations we could not confirm that whether the
acrylic surface has whether these cracks only on the paint itself or whether
it has eaten into the acrylic surface

<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#176:1:B>
That is what I mean I could not confirm

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#177:1:A>
Witness I next refer you to A B thirty three your other
report

<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#178:1:A>
Now under item H you have stated plastic strips said to be made of
acrylic plastic material

<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#179:1:A>
Why have you qualified the words in that manner

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#180:1:B>
Well we did not confirm that whether this is acrylic or not

<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#181:1:B>
It's said to be because it was given to us and said this is an
acrylic board

<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#182:1:B>
That's why we put down as said to be

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#183:1:A>
In other words you cannot confirm that this is an acrylic
board

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#184:1:B>
Well if we were to ask to confirm we could do another test to
confirm whether this is acrylic material or not

<ICE-SIN:S1B-062#185:1:B>
But at that instance we just because after all the board was given
to us say this was the board that's been used for the actual paint work </I>
