ADVICE TO THE PUBLIC

<ICE-SIN:W2B-021#5:1>
MECHANICAL INJURY TO THE SKIN

<ICE-SIN:W2B-021#6:1>
1) The skin should be cleaned thoroughly with antiseptic solution.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-021#7:1>
2) If the embedded thorns are difficult to remove, the patient should
be taken to hospital and the thorns removed under local anesthesia.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-021#8:1>
<h> EXPOSURE TO IRRITANT SAP OR LATEX FROM PLANTS </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-021#9:1>
1) Repeatedly wash the skin with water.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-021#10:1>
Severe itch may be minimised by applying cold water or ice.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-021#11:1>
2) Do not rub the skin or try to get rid of the sap or latex
violently.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-021#12:1>
This might cause loss of skin.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-021#13:1>
3) If it enters the eye, eye should be cleaned with eye wash or clean
water.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-021#14:1>
Do not rub the eye.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-021#15:1>
See a doctor as quickly as possible.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-021#16:1>
<h> CONTACT DERMATITIS </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-021#17:1>
1) Usually treatment is not required as the itching passes away
within hours.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-021#18:1>
2) If itching is intense an anti-histamine or an analgesic may be
helpful to relieve pain.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-021#19:1>
3) A cold compress can relieve some of the itching.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-021#20:1>
4) Prevention is better than cure.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-021#21:1>
Always avoid the plants which are known to cause contact dermatitis
through previous experience.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-021#22:1>
<h> PHOTODERMATITIS </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-021#23:1>
1) A cold compress can reduce the burning sensation.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-021#24:1>
2) Oral administration of aspirin can reduce the inflammatory
reaction.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-021#25:1>
<h> ALLERGIC CONTACT DERMATITIS </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-021#26:1>
1) Prevention is better than cure.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-021#27:1>
Always avoid contact with known plant allergens.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-021#28:1>
2) Washing with water within a few minutes of coming in contact with
allergen may reduce inflammation.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-021#29:1>
3) Cold compress may relieve the pain.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-021#30:1>
Please note that there are other plants which are not described in
this book, which can cause harmful effects to the skin.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-021#31:1>
<h> INTRODUCTION </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-021#32:1>
In this section, plants which may be hazardous to humans, except the
poisonous plants, are described.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-021#33:1>
Plants which have thorns or spines on the stem or leaves can cause
MECHANICAL INJURY, such as wounds or cuts in the skin.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-021#34:1>
There are some plants which when in contact with the human skin will
produce irritation, known as CONTACT URTICARIA ( CONTACT DERMATlTlS).

<ICE-SIN:W2B-021#35:1>
There are other plants which cause the skin to become sensitive to
ultraviolet light, resulting in PHOTODERMATITIS.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-021#36:1>
There is still another group of plants which when exposed to skin
contact repeatedly, will cause inflammation in the skin, with an allergic
reaction known as ALLERGIC CONTACT DERMATITIS.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-021#37:1>
<h> PLANTS CAUSING INJURY TO THE SKIN </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-021#38:1>
The stem or leaves of plants which have thorns, barbs, spines,
bristles or sharp and serrated edges can cause mechanical injury to the human
skin.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-021#39:1>
Sometimes part of the spine or thorn may be broken and embedded in
the skin or the muscle below.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-021#40:1>
These injuries may cause severe pain and at times severe bleeding.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-021#41:1>
When the skin is disrupted it is liable to get secondary infection
from micro-organisms.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-021#42:1>
The broken parts of the plant embedded in the body may cause an
inflammatory reaction and abscess formation or even lead to foreign body
granuloma.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-021#43:1>
If a thorn is embedded in the bone it may produce erosion of the
bone.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-021#44:1>
Plants which have needle-like crystals of calcium oxalate ( raphides)
also can cause intense irritation if these crystals enter the skin through
cuts and wounds.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-021#45:1>
The following plants have irritant raphides:

<ICE-SIN:W2B-021#46:1>
1) Flamingo lily - Anthurium andreanum

Some individuals will become sensitive to ultraviolet rays in the
sunlight after exposure to certain plants.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-021#127:1>
These plants contain a substance known as psoralens ( furocoumarins)
in the sap which can enter into the skin especially when it is moist.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-021#128:1>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-021#138:1>
<h> ALLERGIC CONTACT DERMATITIS </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-021#139:1>
This clinical condition occurs following repeated contact with the
plant and is an allergic phenomenon.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-021#140:1>
The sensitising substance from the plants reacts with protein in the
skin to form the antigen.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-021#141:1>
Once this antigen is formed, there will be a lag period of one to
three weeks during which immunological changes in the body and the skin take
place.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-021#142:1>
Once the sensitivity has been established, subsequent contact with
these plant substances will produce skin reactions ranging from mild erythema
to blisters, crusting and scaling very shortly after the contact.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-021#143:1>
The plants which can cause allergic contact dermatitis are:
Anacardium occidentale L - Cashew-nut Tree ( see p 8).

<ICE-SIN:W2B-021#144:1>
This tropical American tree is occasionally encountered in Singapore
and recognised by its characteristic kidney-shaped nuts.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-021#145:1>
The edible succulent receptacle from which the nut rises turns
bright red or yellow with maturity.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-021#146:1>
The sap from all parts of the plant is poisonous and irritates the
skin.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-021#147:1>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-021#148:1>
This attractive fruit tree is commonly planted in gardens, giving
regular flushes of copperish young leaves.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-021#149:1>
Flowering occurs twice a year when the entire crown is covered with
pinkish white flowers.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-021#150:1>
Fruits are variously shaped according to the cultivars, green
turning yellow.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-021#151:1>
All parts of the plant contain a brownish sap which can result in
allergic contact dermatitis. </I>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-021#153:2>
<h> Plants and Their Differences </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-021#154:2>
1) Plants are living things.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-021#155:2>
They grow, reproduce and respond to changes.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-021#156:2>
2) They also need food, air and water to survive.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-021#157:2>
3) There are many different kinds of plants around us.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-021#158:2>
4) Plants can differ from each other in the places where they grow.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-021#159:2>
They can grow in drains, on walls, roofs and even on other plants.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-021#160:2>
They are also different from each other in their plant parts such as
the stems, leaves, flowers and fruits.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-021#161:2>
<h> Differences In Stems </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-021#162:2>
1) Trees have strong, woody stems that can grow very tall. <X>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-021#X163:2>
These are called trunks.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-021#X164:2>
Branches grow from the trunks.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-021#X165:2>
2) The tree trunk and its branches are protected by a covering
called bark. </X> </I>
