<h> Influences on Testing - - Linguistic and Pedagogic Theories </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-007#5:1>
Language tests aim to give a picture of a student's level of
proficiency as a result of the language programme that he has undergone.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-007#6:1>
They are, therefore, directly influenced by pedagogic theories which
in turn derive their raison d'etre from prevailing linguistic theories.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-007#7:1>
Thus, during the period when language was thought of as comprising a
system of rules which could be learnt, language learning consisted mainly of
learning structural forms.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-007#8:1>
Two pedagogic theories that supported this view of language were the
structuralist-behaviourist approach, based on the work of behavioural
psychologists like Pavlov and Skinner, and the
generative-transformationalist approach, a cognitive and
problem-solving approach based on the work of Chomsky.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-007#9:1>
Testing procedures that came with these methodologies consisted mainly
of testing discrete grammatical elements.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-007#10:1>
An important development in linguistics was to revolutionalise
pedagogic and testing theories and this is the view that the language system
evolves from the functions it serves.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-007#11:1>
The most important proponent of this functional perspective of
language is Halliday who sees language as inextricably a part of the
situation in which it is used and its internal structure or form is important
in so far as it has meaning potential in being able to communicate meaning.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-007#12:1>
In the 1970s, in line with this new orientation in linguistics,
pedagogy moved in the direction of meaningful social experiences as the basis
for the teaching/learning process.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-007#13:1>
This perspective is actualised in the shift from teaching language as
an abstract system to teaching what language can do to convey meaning.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-007#14:1>
A recent and important contribution to methodology within the
communicative paradigm came out of psycholinguistic research.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-007#15:1>
One finding is that learners have the " inherent psychological
capability to acquire linguistic competence when this capacity acts upon
comprehensible input" ( Breen 1987).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-007#16:1>
Another is that learners possess strategies to manage new input by
imposing a certain kind of order on what they encounter to facilitate
language learning.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-007#17:1>
That they use such strategies shows that learners can be
metacommunicative when they are being communicative.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-007#18:1>
This new perspective of the learners' active intervention in the
pedagogic process has given rise to a new process-related approach which
addresses the strategies by which learners achieve communicative
effectiveness.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-007#19:1>
A realization of this process-related approach is the task-based
methodology.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-007#20:1>
This methodology requires the learner to perform tasks which mobilise
his underlying competence such that he employs both " overt interpersonal and
covert personal negotiations of meaning" ( Breen 1987).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-007#21:1>
These are not new strategies for the learner but merely knowledge
systems he is already familiar with as a communicator in his own language.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-007#22:1>
If the tasks are meaningful and challenging enough, the learner will
mobilise his underlying knowledge, however limited it may be, in order to
communicate.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-007#23:1>
An important proponent of the task-based approach is Prabhu ( 1987)
who sees learning a language as building holistically on a complex cognitive
system which we do not have an explicit understanding of.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-007#24:1>
It seems to be a system that enables the learner to bring all
available cognitive resources to his effort to communicate.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-007#25:1>
<h> Assessing Competence through Performance </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-007#26:1>
Testing procedures which attempt to operationalise the communicative
ideology face many uncertainties, the most prominent being what to test and
how to assess, especially since the notion of " communicative" has not been
definitive though it is obvious that it should include certain criteria
features of authentic language use.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-007#27:1>
Rea ( 1985) makes an explicit distinction between communicative
competence and performance.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-007#28:1>
Competence is defined as knowledge in the form of an abstract system
stored in an individual's mind and it " cannot be assessed in any direct way"
( 1985: 21).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-007#29:1>
Performance, on the other hand, is an observable language behaviour
which can be directly assessed.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-007#30:1>
All linguistic behaviour is performance and it is " only through
performance that we may infer levels of competence" ( 1985: 21).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-007#31:1>
Performance can be non-communicative, for example, in test formats
which require mere manipulation of the code and are atomistic in approach.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-007#32:1>
Communicative performance on the other hand, is meaning dependent and
context-bound, involving the mobilisation of " grammatical, sociolinguistic,
strategic and any other competencies" ( 1985 : 24).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-007#33:1>
It allows for the global assessment of an integrated performance.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-007#34:1>
How can all these be translated into a testing procedure?

<ICE-SIN:W2A-007#35:1>
Testing within a Context We must, first of all, bear in mind the
multidimensional use of language, the varied communication situations in
which language is used and, therefore, the need to narrow focus in testing to
more specific areas.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-007#36:1>
The emergence of English for Specific Purposes ( ESP) pedagogy
enables a more explicit definition of communicativeness within a specific
situation where performance criteria can be identified.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-007#37:1>
One such situation is English for Academic Purposes ( EAP).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-007#38:1>
An EAP test tests a learner's communicative effectiveness in an
academic situation.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-007#39:1>
Whereas once EAP was dominated by the concept of registers with an
emphasis on the relative frequencies of occurrence of syntactic and lexical
items, now the orientation is towards a holistic view of language in a
communicative academic environment where language is a functional system
operating within a specific discoursal framework.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-007#40:1>
Next, we must consider the operative criteria which make for an
effective communicative test.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-007#41:1>
Morrow ( 1979) identified seven criteria features of communicative
language use which should be considered in any test that purports to measure
communicative competence.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-007#42:1>
These features are that language use is interaction-based,
unpredictable in its interaction, contextual, purposive, performance-based,
authentic and has a behavioural outcome.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-007#43:1>
To this list we might add that the test should mobilise the testee's
underlying linguistic and cognitive systems in an integrated performance.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-007#44:1>
There is a general belief that there is no such thing as a test of
authentic language behaviour ( Stevenson 1985, Spolsky 1985).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-007#45:1>
There are only authentic language tests.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-007#46:1>
A test with its temporal and psychological constraints is already
compromising real-life language use.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-007#47:1>
To try to measure performance in authentic real-life situations means
to conduct a longitudinal study of the candidate, following him around and
observing how he functions as a student - - taking notes at lectures,
discussing with teachers and peers at tutorials and seminars, writing reports
and the like.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-007#48:1>
Even this mode of evaluation has a constraint: knowing that he is
being " trailed", as it were, puts him on his guard and his performance is
less natural, less authentic.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-007#49:1>
Bearing this caveat in mind, we may, however, choose to be satisfied
with an authentic task which requires the holistic use of language.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-007#50:1>
<h> Task-based Testing </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-007#51:1>
An authentic task in the EAP context is one which a tertiary student
is likely to perform in real life in his academic course.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-007#52:1>
Examples of authentic tasks are making notes from what he sees and
hears, transcoding information from non-verbal ( charts, graphs, tables)
into verbal forms or vice versa, writing reports, making oral presentations
and participating in discussions.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-007#53:1>
The ability to perform all these real life tasks presupposes
proficiency in certain enabling skills, mainly higher order receptive and
productive skills.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-007#54:1>
Higher order receptive or comprehension skills comprise a dynamic
interaction of inferencing, synthesising and critical evaluation resulting in
the student constantly monitoring his state of understanding.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-007#55:1>
Critical evaluation is an important metacognitive strategy.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-007#56:1>
A very important component of comprehension is the processing of
non-verbal forms of information because this is where language " ceases in
effect to be the primary element in the communication: it takes on an
interpretative role - - explaining, highlighting or contextualising what is
visually observable" ( Hutchinson and Waters 1981).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-007#57:1>
Interpreting non-verbal forms also calls for the employment of the
higher order strategies of inferencing, synthesising and critical evaluation.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-007#58:1>
Handling visual data also entails another cognitive process - -
perceptual proficiency in order to transform the visual display into
meaningful mental representation and eventual comprehension.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-007#59:1>
Within the testing environment, productive skills are skills
attendant on comprehension.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-007#60:1>
They are usually demonstrated in composition and summary writing,
note-taking and note-making and even in non-verbal forms.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-007#61:1>
Basically a test of productive skills is a test of a candidate's
proficiency as a competent communicator.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-007#62:1>
Production presupposes reception and comprehension which is
traditionally tested by answering comprehension questions of the open-ended
or close-ended multiple-choice type.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-007#63:1>
However, comprehension can also be demonstrated in a more productive
and dynamic performance, for example, the reorganisation of information into
verbal or non-verbal forms to serve the purpose for which the information is
elicited.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-007#64:1>
<h> Sample Questions </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-007#65:1>
An example of a test question that attempts to incorporate the above
principles comes from the Joint Matriculation Board Test in English (
Overseas) March 1979 written paper.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-007#66:1>
The JMB Test ( recently revised and renamed the University Entrance
Test in English for Speakers of Other Languages or UETESOL) was a university
qualifying test conducted by the northern universities of Manchester,
Liverpool, Leeds, Sheffield and Birmingham.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-007#67:1>
( Please refer to Appendix A for guestion 1) In this question, the
candidate is tested on his ability to understand the communicative value of a
non-verbal device and to recode this information into a verbal form.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-007#68:1>
Here the visual stimuli is a cross section of a windmill.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-007#69:1>
Productive skills with respect to two particular core language
functions are assessed - - general description ( Write about the appearance
of the mill and its equipment) and description of process ( Write about how
wheat is ground into flour).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-007#70:1>
The process is indicated by arrows.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-007#71:1>
The correctness of the steps in the process also requires perceptual
efficiency in order to make sense of the arrows.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-007#72:1>
In the description of process, narrative padding is also necessary in
describing the structure of the grinding stone given in the inset.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-007#73:1>
While the rubric is precise and the diagram clear, the actual outcome
does not just involve a straightforward description of process as some
cognitive processing is also needed to conceptualise the whole process of
grinding wheat and to make sense of the technical principles behind energy
generated by the wind, the mechanics of cog and wheels and the concept of
pressure and friction for the actual grinding.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-007#74:1>
There is, thus, a certain amount of bias as the ability to do the
question effectively presupposes knowledge of the above stated principles
which test constructors can defend as general scientific principles which a
technological society is familiar with ( Please refer to Appendix B for
Question 5A) Question 5A of the JMB June 1979 paper tests comprehension of an
extended text.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-007#75:1>
The candidate has to demonstrate his comprehension by performing a
task using higher order comprehension skills ( eg skimming and scanning) and
higher order cognitive skills ( eg hypothesizing, evaluating,
problem-solving).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-007#76:1>
What is interesting about this question is that it is an attempt to
evaluate the reading process by the very nature of the question.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-007#77:1>
The product of comprehension is the attempted task.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-007#78:1>
While the product is the operational criterion of comprehension, the
question ensures the use of higher level strategies to arrive at the product.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-007#79:1>
So, indirectly, the efficient use of these strategies are being
tested.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-007#80:1>
Also to arrive at the product, the candidate needs to comprehend the
instructions and carry them out accurately.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-007#81:1>
In the process of completing the task set, the reader does not just
reproduce information from the text but has to reorganise data to suit the
task.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-007#82:1>
The complex and involved task tests global comprehension.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-007#83:1>
It does more than just assess the ability to locate specific
information.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-007#84:1>
It calls for the ability to scan for particular information, extract,
summarise and manipulate information, make inferences and apply the
information to the solution of a related problem ( UETESOL Syllabus 1990).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-007#85:1>
Underlying the task is the reorganisation of information to gain
insight into rhetorical relationships, even though the structure of the
rhetorical organisation is made apparent in the question itself ( Table 1 in
Appendix B).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-007#86:1>
It also requires the use of one's background knowledge to visualise
the appearance of " box-like kite", " triangular-shaped bodies" or "
bird-like wings".

<ICE-SIN:W2A-007#87:1>
Another important feature is the use of the non-verbal medium.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-007#88:1>
Here the candidate has to transcode verbal cues into a non-verbal
medium by matching description and picture.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-007#89:1>
By requiring an identification through description of the physical
appearance, the question calls for small pieces of information to be
synthesised to build up an image. <X>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-007#X90:1>
The advantage of task-based testing is that it allows orientation to
a clearly definable and purposive activity in a particular communicative
situation, for example, the academic environment, and the assessment of the
strategies required to perform in this environment.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-007#X91:1>
Task-based testing addresses the overall capacity to perform.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-007#X92:1>
This testing methodology is basically a problem-solving approach
where linguistic and non-linguistic resources operate together on inputs to
reach a solution.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-007#X93:1>
Such inputs are varied in form and content and can be graphic or
verbal, stated or inferred.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-007#X94:1>
<h> Grammar and its Assesment in Task-based Testing </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-007#X95:1>
Communicative testing should not only test the conveying of meaning
with a total disregard for form as a show of the complete rejection of the
ideology of the structural era.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-007#X96:1>
Prabhu ( in personal communication) sees two positions that grammar
can assume in communicative testing: first, grammar in response to linguistic
elicitation and second, grammar in response to a task.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-007#X97:1>
The first position, as the name suggests, is very much a matter of
the candidate's demonstration of grammatical knowledge.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-007#X98:1>
When grammar is to be elicited deliberately, the test constructor
can choose to test particular linguistic items.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-007#X99:1>
For example, if he chooses to assess a candidate's control of the
tenses, he would probably set a contrived situation which requires the
student to use different tenses, a procedure unlikely to be matched in
real-life language use.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-007#X100:1>
There is reliability in assessing the candidate's knowledge of this
grammatical item based on how many right answers he gives.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-007#X101:1>
In communicative testing, where authentic language use is a
premium, deliberate elicitation of grammatical knowledge has a price, namely,
a low level of validity.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-007#X102:1>
Where grammatical competence is not elicited, but deployed
spontaneously when a task is being performed, the ability shown is genuine.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-007#X103:1>
With grammar in deployment, there is less opportunity for testing
the candidate's knowledge of specific grammatical items since a candidate may
or may not employ those particular items in performing a task.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-007#X104:1>
It is, however, a valid method of testing a candidate's control of
the code as a whole for the purpose of conveying meaning.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-007#X105:1>
It is in these two positions of grammar that the tension between
validity and reliability becomes obvious.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-007#X106:1>
The importance that a test constructor places on grammar can be
reflected in the weighting for the completed task and the language control.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-007#X107:1>
He may even choose to use the task to test only grammatical
competence because the grammar that emerges out of a task performance is the
test taker's norm and is a genuine product of his communicative competence.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-007#X108:1>
A grammar test, therefore, does not need to be a discrete point
test.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-007#X109:1>
A task-based or holistic test can function as a test of grammatical
competence as well as a test of naturalistic language behaviour.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-007#X110:1>
<h> Conclusion </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-007#X111:1>
Integrated performance approximates real-life language use more
closely than does the perception of language use as comprising distinct
skills.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-007#X112:1>
In integrated performance, all necessary abilities are employed
simultaneously in the same act of communication.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-007#X113:1>
This essential holism in real-life language underlies the
task-based testing procedure.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-007#X114:1>
Pedagogy is now concerned with teaching the learner how to do
things with language.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-007#X115:1>
Testing must be concerned with giving the testee the opportunity to
demonstrate what he can do with language in a purposeful manner.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-007#X116:1>
It should not only be concerned with producing a score.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-007#X117:1>
Test constructors have the responsibility to innovate on present
procedures so that teaching and testing can move in tandem within the
communicative paradigm. </X> </I>
