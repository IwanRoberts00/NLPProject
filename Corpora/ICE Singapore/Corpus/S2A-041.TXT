<I>

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-041#1:1:A>
But in this part of the world we're still okay and uh and the
emphasis is really is to say how do we look at the market place today and how
can address those challenges that we have

<ICE-SIN:S2A-041#2:1:A>
And uh when I look at you it makes me feel very young I mean it was
uh seems like yesterday that I was still thinking of

<ICE-SIN:S2A-041#3:1:A>
And uh the way that he gave me the the the introduction makes me
feel very old eight years

<ICE-SIN:S2A-041#4:1:A>
Okay market management

<ICE-SIN:S2A-041#5:1:A>
What I intend to is that I just go through a very uh brief outline
of what market management is all about

<ICE-SIN:S2A-041#6:1:A>
And uh if any point in time whereby you want to stop me and ask
questions please do so right

<ICE-SIN:S2A-041#7:1:A>
Don't hesitate to that

<ICE-SIN:S2A-041#8:1:A>
Now since this is entrepreneurship society right I should talk about
name?? of entrepreneurs

<ICE-SIN:S2A-041#9:1:A>
Now I just want to have this chart

<ICE-SIN:S2A-041#10:1:A>
Now you have a lot of uh hell a lot of definition on what's what an
entrepreneur is and uh in my personal opinion this is nothing this is just my
opinion alright

<ICE-SIN:S2A-041#11:1:A>
I think there should be a balance between in-born traits and
acquired knowledge right

<ICE-SIN:S2A-041#12:1:A>
In-born traits are something like you cannot learn

<ICE-SIN:S2A-041#13:1:A>
I mean it's in you whether you have a guts you dare to take risk
are you a risk taker or are you a risk adverse

<ICE-SIN:S2A-041#14:1:A>
Are you innovative do you have a vision

<ICE-SIN:S2A-041#15:1:A>
Do you have a strong desire to succeed and whether you have
business acumen

<ICE-SIN:S2A-041#16:1:A>
This is something that is one side of the weighing scale

<ICE-SIN:S2A-041#17:1:A>
But very often a lot of people talk about entrepreneur they talk
about this side

<ICE-SIN:S2A-041#18:1:A>
They forgot about this acquired knowledge

<ICE-SIN:S2A-041#19:1:A>
Not many of us are so lucky that the we can leave school you know
if we don't feel studying right for we still have to acquire some knowledge

<ICE-SIN:S2A-041#20:1:A>
And this knowledge is really to help the entrepreneur to make
structured decision

<ICE-SIN:S2A-041#21:1:A>
This is called structured business approach how you plans and
control your how do you plan and control your company and that's very
important part of entrepreneur

<ICE-SIN:S2A-041#22:1:A>
How does a entrepreneur grow

<ICE-SIN:S2A-041#23:1:A>
And once it grow how do you control it

<ICE-SIN:S2A-041#24:1:A>
It it's better if you have some basic accounting and legal
knowledge although if you have money to buy this profession and of course
lastly it's management skills

<ICE-SIN:S2A-041#25:1:A>
So you really need a combination of both to make you a good
entrepreneur

<ICE-SIN:S2A-041#26:1:A>
And uh what I intend to do today maybe I don't have this ought in
maybe share a little bit some of the uh methods or some of the scientific way
of managing a market

<ICE-SIN:S2A-041#27:1:A>
And uh hopefully those who have this will in complement with your
knowledge

<ICE-SIN:S2A-041#28:1:A>
These are the only two colour charts I have okay the rest is black
and white

<ICE-SIN:S2A-041#29:1:A>
I just want to give a brief intoduc introduction of what is market
management and how's how is it relevant to entrepreneurship

<ICE-SIN:S2A-041#30:1:A>
I want to introduce the term call meas market measures cookbook
this is actually the term we use in IBM on how we look at the market place

<ICE-SIN:S2A-041#31:1:A>
And uh we do a lot im portfolio analysis and uh this is not new
those who study financial management right is nothing to do with shares but
if you manage a market it's actually a portfolio

<ICE-SIN:S2A-041#32:1:A>
And of course how do you integrate of what you have and how you
implement in the market place

<ICE-SIN:S2A-041#33:1:A>
And I'll conclude you got any questions

<ICE-SIN:S2A-041#34:1:A>
So far in my seminars the first few charts always no problems
because they cannot cannot fault my agenda right

<ICE-SIN:S2A-041#35:1:A>
Now the content

<ICE-SIN:S2A-041#36:1:A>
Now what is market management really

<ICE-SIN:S2A-041#37:1:A>
Now we define it as analysis planning implementation and
measurement of programme design to determine the needs and wants of both new
and existing target markets

<ICE-SIN:S2A-041#38:1:A>
Now you have this this term on customer satisfaction right customer
needs and wants

<ICE-SIN:S2A-041#39:1:A>
So the whole idea of market management is really for you understand
who are your target customer

<ICE-SIN:S2A-041#40:1:A>
They are the one who buy your good and services

<ICE-SIN:S2A-041#41:1:A>
I mean without the customer you won't get your salary

<ICE-SIN:S2A-041#42:1:A>
Without your customer you won't come?? you won't get your income
from company right

<ICE-SIN:S2A-041#43:1:A>
So who what does a customer wants in the market

<ICE-SIN:S2A-041#44:1:A>
And new and existing target markets you have to target

<ICE-SIN:S2A-041#45:1:A>
I mean we learn a long way in IBM alright in the past when we first
started we are everywhere

<ICE-SIN:S2A-041#46:1:A>
I mean every high end to the low very low end we are we've maintain
presence everywhere

<ICE-SIN:S2A-041#47:1:A>
But right now we ask ourselves right can we afford it do we have
the skills

<ICE-SIN:S2A-041#48:1:A>
Maybe we are not all things to all people

<ICE-SIN:S2A-041#49:1:A>
Maybe we should able to segment the market

<ICE-SIN:S2A-041#50:1:A>
Those that we are strong we shall have a strong segment those who
are weak and we think it's emerging we should do something about it

<ICE-SIN:S2A-041#51:1:A>
So this is whole of concept of market management

<ICE-SIN:S2A-041#52:1:A>
Now the design customer satisfaction it's only the customer that is
satisfied with you then he'll keep on doing business with you

<ICE-SIN:S2A-041#53:1:A>
If your customer is not happy they will not come back the second
time

<ICE-SIN:S2A-041#54:1:A>
So in whatever business that you do your focus is only the customer

<ICE-SIN:S2A-041#55:1:A>
And of course the purpose is to achieve organisation objectives is
very simple

<ICE-SIN:S2A-041#56:1:A>
Profit revenue market share which is very dear to every
organisation

<ICE-SIN:S2A-041#57:1:A>
I sleep with it eat with it and do everything else with it

<ICE-SIN:S2A-041#58:1:A>
Right this this diagram just show that you have the voice of the
customer you listen to your customer what your customer wants alright

<ICE-SIN:S2A-041#59:1:A>
You plan you you define your solution how can I meet the customer
need the customer has a problem the customer has a need how can I meet that
needs

<ICE-SIN:S2A-041#60:1:A>
How do I be a solution that against that need

<ICE-SIN:S2A-041#61:1:A>
And how do I deliver it what channels do I deliver it and how do I
measure that whether I'm I succeed or I fail

<ICE-SIN:S2A-041#62:1:A>
So in every step in organisation these are the key elements that to
determine whether you are doing a good job in managing the market

<ICE-SIN:S2A-041#63:1:A>
Now you have blow this up to actually look at a model

<ICE-SIN:S2A-041#64:1:A>
Now what are customer needs and wants is really how do you how do
you go about understanding customer needs and wants alright

<ICE-SIN:S2A-041#65:1:A>
It's called opportunity assessment

<ICE-SIN:S2A-041#66:1:A>
How do you assess opportunity

<ICE-SIN:S2A-041#67:1:A>
I mean although I present all these steps to a big company like IBM
is easy because we have I used to manage a big department of a twenty over
people doing nothing but just planning

<ICE-SIN:S2A-041#68:1:A>
I mean they're just dreamers

<ICE-SIN:S2A-041#69:1:A>
Everyday come to office sit down there and just dream of things
look at market place right

<ICE-SIN:S2A-041#70:1:A>
But if you're entrepreneur you're one man show

<ICE-SIN:S2A-041#71:1:A>
How do you go about doing it

<ICE-SIN:S2A-041#72:1:A>
It's a degree of how much you do but still you have to do

<ICE-SIN:S2A-041#73:1:A>
You must know what's the opportunity in the market place right

<ICE-SIN:S2A-041#74:1:A>
And then you say these are the opportunities and ask myself where
should I select my market

<ICE-SIN:S2A-041#75:1:A>
Should I go after a PC market or should I go to a higher edge or
should I go to software or should I go to solution

<ICE-SIN:S2A-041#76:1:A>
Even software should I go to the emerging new technology or should
I just write a PC programme and put do games for kids

<ICE-SIN:S2A-041#77:1:A>
So these are selection of segment

<ICE-SIN:S2A-041#78:1:A>
When once you selected how do you strategize in this segment

<ICE-SIN:S2A-041#79:1:A>
How do you go about gaining share

<ICE-SIN:S2A-041#80:1:A>
How do you about winning opportunities

<ICE-SIN:S2A-041#81:1:A>
And then you do a segment study

<ICE-SIN:S2A-041#82:1:A>
Segment study simply say where you are today

<ICE-SIN:S2A-041#83:1:A>
Do you have the strength

<ICE-SIN:S2A-041#84:1:A>
Do you have the uh ability to meet the challenges in the market
place

<ICE-SIN:S2A-041#85:1:A>
If you don't have those strengths how how you go about doing

<ICE-SIN:S2A-041#86:1:A>
Should you go into maybe a partnership acquire some other companies
to help you to do it or source solutions right

<ICE-SIN:S2A-041#87:1:A>
Then you do a you develop a segment plan

<ICE-SIN:S2A-041#88:1:A>
Now these are these are really a very detail steps in planning
which I don't intend to go into details of it

<ICE-SIN:S2A-041#89:1:A>
In fact when I I've been going round the countries to preach these
and it always takes about three days course and I'm only given one hour right
so I just want to skim through all these term

<ICE-SIN:S2A-041#90:1:A>
But if you have any question please let me know

<ICE-SIN:S2A-041#91:1:A>
Now once you define the customer needs and want if this a internal
we call commitment managements internal planning process how do you go about
sourcings and development

<ICE-SIN:S2A-041#92:1:A>
These are internal organisation plan right

<ICE-SIN:S2A-041#93:1:A>
How do you have plan development or how do you offer the solutions

<ICE-SIN:S2A-041#94:1:A>
And how do you gonna start it and I think last week you or the week
after next you'll learn some something about funding alright

<ICE-SIN:S2A-041#95:1:A>
And how do you price your products

<ICE-SIN:S2A-041#96:1:A>
Pricing is a very important element as entrepreneur

<ICE-SIN:S2A-041#97:1:A>
Not everything is priced low

<ICE-SIN:S2A-041#98:1:A>
I mean we'll learn it a hard way in in the computer industry

<ICE-SIN:S2A-041#99:1:A>
I think when we you talk about IBM what's what's the first
impression you have

<ICE-SIN:S2A-041#100:1:A>
Very expensive right

<ICE-SIN:S2A-041#101:1:A>
Very expensive but is it price is is it a main is the main is
pricing the main reason why that we lose share

<ICE-SIN:S2A-041#102:1:A>
If I lower the price more will I gain back all the shares

<ICE-SIN:S2A-041#103:1:A>
Is a very interesting toil on price

<ICE-SIN:S2A-041#104:1:A>
Then you you have to really know how you deliver your solution
right

<ICE-SIN:S2A-041#105:1:A>
What is your customer relationship

<ICE-SIN:S2A-041#106:1:A>
Now in all business you and your customers is very important
especially on relationship

<ICE-SIN:S2A-041#107:1:A>
Why should your customer buy from

<ICE-SIN:S2A-041#108:1:A>
You are similar guys selling the same products

<ICE-SIN:S2A-041#109:1:A>
Sometimes it's the face that matters alright and uh it's important
your relationship with your customer and the services you provide

<ICE-SIN:S2A-041#110:1:A>
Why should we stress so much on services

<ICE-SIN:S2A-041#111:1:A>
Like Singapore Airlines for example

<ICE-SIN:S2A-041#112:1:A>
Why when they first started how do they say this airline what's
the airline what's the difference

<ICE-SIN:S2A-041#113:1:A>
How do I differentiate mine product from the other airline company
in services the in-flight service the Singapore girl alright sarong kebaya

<ICE-SIN:S2A-041#114:1:A>
So these are you know all the all the differentiation strategies
that SIA has adopted and because services is where the customer see

<ICE-SIN:S2A-041#115:1:A>
And of course you must have a continuous measurement feedback

<ICE-SIN:S2A-041#116:1:A>
And very often the entrepreneur you see a lot small companies
right it's nothing good for them to to say how well they are doing

<ICE-SIN:S2A-041#117:1:A>
They do by gut feel

<ICE-SIN:S2A-041#118:1:A>
They look at things that're happening

<ICE-SIN:S2A-041#119:1:A>
But really you need have a structured measurement process where
you ask yourself where you are today what you want to achieve

<ICE-SIN:S2A-041#120:1:A>
And at the end of the day what is the bottom line that you're
looking for

<ICE-SIN:S2A-041#121:1:A>
Alright so far any question

<ICE-SIN:S2A-041#122:1:A>
How do you go about doing a selection process in the market place
alright

<ICE-SIN:S2A-041#123:1:A>
Now you have there are three elements that you have to take note

<ICE-SIN:S2A-041#124:1:A>
One is the size of the market

<ICE-SIN:S2A-041#125:1:A>
You have to know how big is the market place

<ICE-SIN:S2A-041#126:1:A>
What is the structure of the market

<ICE-SIN:S2A-041#127:1:A>
Is it a very clustered or is it very disperse

<ICE-SIN:S2A-041#128:1:A>
Is it attractive to go in

<ICE-SIN:S2A-041#129:1:A>
If maybe in the industry the PC industry for example every guy is
losing money you you come across a very good design do you want to go in

<ICE-SIN:S2A-041#130:1:A>
What kind of activities that settle in the industry You have to do
a lot a bit of sales analysis

<ICE-SIN:S2A-041#131:1:A>
Is it of is there a lot of opportunity?

<ICE-SIN:S2A-041#132:1:A>
Who are the customers and keenly who are your competitors

<ICE-SIN:S2A-041#133:1:A>
Because you are the small guys right

<ICE-SIN:S2A-041#134:1:A>
Who are the big guys in the market place

<ICE-SIN:S2A-041#135:1:A>
Because if there are big guys in the market you need a lot of uh
your strength will be different you need a lot of capital right

<ICE-SIN:S2A-041#136:1:A>
How do you how do you go into the market from there and what
product exist in the market <X>

<ICE-SIN:S2A-041#X137:1:A>
You have to select in your prioritise </X> </I>
