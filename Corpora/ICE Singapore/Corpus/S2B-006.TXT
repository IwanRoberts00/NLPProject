well the Corporation should be privatised in about two years

This is announced tonight by the Minister for Information and the
Arts Brigadier General George Yeo at the SBC staff union dinner

<ICE-SIN:S2B-006#10:1:A>
Under the proposed privatisation model SBC's current operations
will be hyped off to separate companies

<ICE-SIN:S2B-006#11:1:A>
The three TV channels will come under two or three different
companies while the whole of SBC Radio will be formed into one company for a
start

<ICE-SIN:S2B-006#12:1:A>
Other companies will be formed to run production and transmission
facilities

<ICE-SIN:S2B-006#13:1:A>
All these operating companies will come under a holding company
which will be owned by the government

<ICE-SIN:S2B-006#14:1:A>
Over time the government will sell off all or parts of the
operating company and the holding company to local and foreign investors

<ICE-SIN:S2B-006#15:1:A>
General Yeo said when SBC's privatised a separate statutory board
will be set up to regulate broadcasting

<ICE-SIN:S2B-006#16:1:A>
It will collect licence fees and justify to the government the
amount of public funds required every year to subsidise public service
broadcasting

<ICE-SIN:S2B-006#17:1:A>
This will include Malay and Tamil programs as well as those
telecast to achieve a specific public purpose like National Day

<ICE-SIN:S2B-006#18:1:A>
The statutory board will allocate funds to the different operating
companies and specify the minimum number of hours for news current affairs
children's and locally produced programs

<ICE-SIN:S2B-006#19:1:A>
On Pay TV which will be introduced next year starting with CNN in
April General Yeo said SBC will own only a minority stake in that company

<ICE-SIN:S2B-006#20:1:A>
The majority stake will be held by Temasek Holdings for the time
being

<ICE-SIN:S2B-006#21:1:A>
Pay TV will operate on a commercial basis and will have to pay the
government a fee for broadcast right

<ICE-SIN:S2B-006#22:1:A>
MITA will regulate Pay TV for the first two years till the
regulatory statutory board is formed

<ICE-SIN:S2B-006#23:1:A>
General Yeo said privatisation was necessary and good for the
people of Singapore

<ICE-SIN:S2B-006#24:1:A>
He added that if SBC does not privatise and introduce competition
it will slide behind as television globalises and differentiates

to develop nuclear weapons

billion dollars
