<h> INTRODUCTION </h>

<ICE-SIN:W1A-008#2:1>
In his discussion on what constitutes worthwhile sociolinguistics, (
Wardhaugh 1986:11) says, " specific points of connection between language and
society must be discovered, and these must be related within theories that
throw light on how linguistic and social structures interact".

<ICE-SIN:W1A-008#3:1>
So it seems appropriate that a discussion on the usefulness of the
concept of social class in a sociolinguistic survey in Singapore, should
entail how well the concept systematically captures salient features in the
Singapore society, to allow a meaningful explanation of the pattern and habit
of language use here.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-008#4:1>
To set the context of discussion, this essay will outline some general
features of the society in Singapore.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-008#5:1>
The concept of social class as defined in Singapore will then be
examined.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-008#6:1>
An attempt will be made in assessing the effectiveness of the concept
as a system in capturing social features which help explain language use.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-008#7:1>
<h> General Features of Singapore </h>

<ICE-SIN:W1A-008#8:1>
Singapore is a small nation state of nearly three million people, void
of natural resources and heavily dependent on international trade and its
human resources for economic survival.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-008#9:1>
The population is multi-ethnic, with official recognition of three
main ethnic groups: Chinese 77.7%, Malays 14.1%, Indians 7.1%, and 1.1% of
various other ethnic origins ( Lau 1992:5).

<ICE-SIN:W1A-008#10:1>
There are four official languages, three of them official ethnic
mother tongues related to each dominant ethnic group: Chinese Malay and
Tamil.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-008#11:1>
English, the fourth official language is part of the British colonial
legacy.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-008#12:1>
It is not identified with any ethnic group in Singapore, but plays a
predominant role in government administration, commerce, international trade,
and formal education.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-008#13:1>
The linguistic situation in Singapore is more complex than the
official ethnic and language categorisations suggest.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-008#14:1>
Subsumed under each official ethnic label are different sub-groups
which speak different native dialects, often mutually unintelligible.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-008#15:1>
Singapore life is characterised by the mentality of top-down planning
since the independence of the country in 1965.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-008#16:1>
Because of the primacy of human resources and external trade for
economic survival, and added to that the potentially volatile
ethnic-linguistic diversity of the population, policy-makers have been
especially interested in education and language planning.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-008#17:1>
Given its small physical size and effective means of communication,
policies are implemented swiftly, and their impact penetrating.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-008#18:1>
It is against such a background of ethnic-linguistic complexity and
dynamic social planning, that the concept of social class and its relevance
to a sociolinguistic survey in Singapore are discussed.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-008#19:1>
<h> Social Class in Singapore </h>

<ICE-SIN:W1A-008#20:1>
There are generally two theoretical approaches to the concept of
social class: the conflict approach and the functional approach ( Theodorson
1990).

<ICE-SIN:W1A-008#21:1>
In the classical conflict theory of Marx, there are two groups with
conflicting interests within a capitalist society: the ruling class which
controls the means of production, and the proletariat whose labour is
exploited by the ruling elite.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-008#22:1>
In Weber's theory, conflict within society is multi-dimensional, with
different groups controlling access to different resources.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-008#23:1>
The functional approach assumes that there is social consensus in the
evaluation of the relative importance of different functional positions.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-008#24:1>
Income and occupational prestige are given according to the relative
importance of one's function in society.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-008#25:1>
They are therefore important indicators of one's social class status.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-008#26:1>
Educational attainment, which is the mark of one's qualification to
perform a function, is the third important indicator of one's social class
status.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-008#27:1>
A recent sociological study of social class in Singapore ( Quah et al
1991), seems to have synthesized the conflict and functional approaches.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-008#28:1>
As the study is not only the latest, but also " the first published
sociological study of social class in Singapore" ( Quah et al 1991:1), the
discussion on the relevance of the concept of social class in a
sociolinguistic survey in Singapore, has to involve examining the study to a
certain extent.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-008#29:1>
In theoretical conceptualisation, the study adopts the conflict
approach.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-008#30:1>
The researchers set out to examine social class in Singapore, based
on the view of conflict theorist Dahrendorf, that social classes exist "
whenever authority is unequally distributed over social positions" (
Dahrendorf 1959:245 as quoted in Quah et al 1991:26).

<ICE-SIN:W1A-008#31:1>
In the objective method of study, Weber's multi-dimensional approach
is adopted.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-008#32:1>
Social class status is measured in three different dimensions which
are essentially the social class indicators of the functional approach:
income level, educational attainment and occupational status.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-008#33:1>
The three hierarchies are then combined into a socio-economic status
( SES) scale.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-008#34:1>
The integration of the three hierarchies into one single scale
appears well founded.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-008#35:1>
As in other modern countries where social status is achieved rather
than ascribed, the study found close correlation between the three social
class indicators of income, educational level and occupation prestige.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-008#36:1>
One important finding that the study reveals is that there is neither
a dominant monolithic social class bloc in Singapore, nor discrete social
classes.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-008#37:1>
Rather, the study discovers, Singaporeans are found along the entire
SES scale, forming a social class continuum <h> SES Continuum and Lectal
Continuum in Singapore English </h>

<ICE-SIN:W1A-008#38:1>
As one unitary scale which aptly captures the educational attainment,
income and occupation prestige of Singaporeans, the social class continuum
seems to be a plausible systematic framework that captures the essentials of
the Singapore society.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-008#39:1>
It ties monetary and job prestige rewards to educational attainment
which includes knowledge of English.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-008#40:1>
Indeed, the notion of a social class continuum has appeared to be an
important concept in the sociolinguistic description of English use in
Singapore.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-008#41:1>
Platt and Weber ( 1980) describe sub-varieties of English in
Singapore as a lectal continuum which corresponds with socio-economic
ranking.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-008#42:1>
They see the relationship between the two continuums as follows:

<ICE-SIN:W1A-008#43:1>
( Platt & Weber 1980:109)

<ICE-SIN:W1A-008#44:1>
Foley ( 1988) demonstrates that the model of lectal continuum has
been accepted by many linguists as an adequate description of Singapore
English for more than a decade since its introduction in 1975.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-008#45:1>
As much as the lectal continuum is a meaningful socio-linguistic
conceptualisation of Singapore English, the underlying concept of a social
class continuum seems also to be a useful conceptual tool in sociolinguistic
surveys in Singapore.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-008#46:1>
<h> Shortcomings of Platt's lectal model / Inadequacies of Social
Class Continuum </h>

<ICE-SIN:W1A-008#47:1>
However, Foley also points out the shortcoming of the model. <X>
<quote>

<ICE-SIN:W1A-008#X48:1>
Platt's model does not seem to distinguish between uneducated and
the informality of an educated speaker.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-008#X49:1>
He calls both basilectal.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-008#X50:1>
Also the different lects are difficult to identify in actual
discourse and lack sociolinguistic and psychological reality.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-008#X51:1>
( Foley 1988:13) </quote> </X>

<ICE-SIN:W1A-008#52:1>
Foley's comments bring out the point that the variety of English used
by a Singaporean at any particular time, is affected by his both his
educational background and the context of use.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-008#53:1>
At first sight, it may seem that Platt's lectal continuum model
neatly accounts for the correlation between a Singaporean's education
background and the variety of English he uses.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-008#54:1>
But what the model accounts for is only the educational level he has
attained, not the type of education he has had.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-008#55:1>
In Singapore, there were schools where English was the medium of
instruction, and others where it was one of the official ethnic languages.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-008#56:1>
Clearly those with an English stream education would be more
proficient in their English.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-008#57:1>
As the education system with different streams was only phased out in
the late 1980s, and practically all adult Singaporeans are affected by the
type of education in their use of English.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-008#58:1>
But the concept of social class continuum, as much as Platt's lectal
continuum, clearly omits the educational type of Singaporean.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-008#59:1>
It is therefore handicapped as a tool in sociolinguistic surveys in
Singapore.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-008#60:1>
Referring to Foley's criticism of Platt's lectal continuum, the
formality of a situation has to be considered in a description of the use of
languages.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-008#61:1>
In the case of Singapore English, the tendency is to move towards
what Platt terms the basilectal variety with the informality of the
situation.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-008#62:1>
In addition, the background of the person one is speaking to also
forms an integral part of the context of speech.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-008#63:1>
An English-educated Singaporean with a command of both the formal
educated variety of English and the informal variety, would not speak the
educated variety to someone who understands only the informal variety if he
wishes to be understood.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-008#64:1>
His use of the informal variety at that point in time in no way
characterises him as someone of low education.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-008#65:1>
In omitting the important contextual dimension of language use, the
concept of social class is yet again found wanting as a tool in
sociolinguistic survey in Singapore.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-008#66:1>
However, an assessment of the usefulness of the concept of social
class should not only constitute social class defined as a continuum.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-008#67:1>
The viability of the conflict interpretation in organising
individuals within a society into discrete social classes should also be
considered.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-008#68:1>
<h> Conflict Approach to Social Class </h>

<ICE-SIN:W1A-008#69:1>
Guy ( 1988:46-47) in discussing the impact of colonialism on class
and language, mentions that in the multilingual ex-colonies, the language of
the ex-colonial power often retains its functions and primacy.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-008#70:1>
This is because the language serves the exclusive purpose for the
indigenous elite in administration, legal and educational functions as it did
for the foreign one.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-008#71:1>
Such a stark picture of power play may not be reflective of Singapore
since access to the language of primacy is provided as a crucial component of
universal education.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-008#72:1>
But the dichotomy between the ruling elite and the ruled may be a
useful tool in discussing language issues in Singapore.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-008#73:1>
This is especially so, given the reality of top-down planning in
Singapore life.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-008#74:1>
For instance, in the pronunciation of English, official practices
have insisted on using British Received Pronunciation ( RP) as a model.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-008#75:1>
This is so despite the impracticality of the idea, since there is no
strong RP-speaking community in Singapore to serve as a reference group ( Tay
and Gupta:1983).

<ICE-SIN:W1A-008#76:1>
Considering that there is another native variety with greater
currency, and that a remote foreign model is hardly the ideal medium to
express national identity, the insistence on RP as a model seems an
idiosyncratic preoccupation of the leading elite.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-008#77:1>
Extending the argument to the micro level, the conflict model may be
used to explain phonological or morphological variables in Singapore English
as Milroy and Milroy ( 1992) suggest.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-008#78:1>
Within this framework, it is not surprising that Platt's acrolectal
Singapore English should be exclusively associated with those in better-paid
professional occupations, since in the Marxist notion of the linguistic
market, language is a form of cultural and social capital that can be
transformed into economic capital.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-008#79:1>
However, the conflict model seems limited in usefulness.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-008#80:1>
Its function seems confined to providing a theoretical framework for
explaining what has already been uncovered in earlier sociolinguistic survey
or sociolinguistic oddities initiated top-down.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-008#81:1>
It provides no measurable variable which could be systematically used
in a sociolinguistic survey.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-008#82:1>
And there is one important social factor affecting language use which
is easily distinguished, but yet not accounted for in either definition of
social class - ethnicity.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-008#83:1>
<h> Importance of Ethnicity </h>

<ICE-SIN:W1A-008#84:1>
The ethnicity and to a lesser degree the ethnic sub-group affiliation
of a Singaporean often determine the languages present in his verbal
repertoire.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-008#85:1>
For instance, a Singapore Chinese belonging to the Hainanese
dialectal group, may have English, Mandarin and Hainanese in his verbal
repertoire, but his Malay friend may have English, Tamil and Malay in his.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-008#86:1>
If one considers the influence of native tongue in the phonological,
syntactic and lexical features of English spoken by a Singaporean, and if one
considers in addition, the role native tongue plays in the phenomenon of
code-switching, ethnicity is certainly a factor that cannot be left out in a
sociolinguistic survey regardless of whether the study is at a general or
micro level.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-008#87:1>
Yet there is hardly a way in which ethnic differences can be
represented in the social class concept.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-008#88:1>
Especially when the recent study by Quah et al finds that " each
interval or category of social class scores, from the lowest to the highest,
presents a multi-ethnic composition, and in each interval, the largest group
is the Chinese ...

<ICE-SIN:W1A-008#89:1>
this is expected considering that Chinese form 76.1% of the
population" ( Quah et al 1991:86).

<ICE-SIN:W1A-008#90:1>
<h> Sex </h>

<ICE-SIN:W1A-008#91:1>
Tay ( 1979) lists sex as a factor affecting the use of English among
Singaporeans.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-008#92:1>
This is a factor which the concept of social class also omits.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-008#93:1>
Different socialisation of girls and boys may account for their
difference in language use.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-008#94:1>
But the difference in language habits between the sexes may not be as
significant as the factor of ethnicity discussed above. <X>

<ICE-SIN:W1A-008#X95:1>
In Singapore, the difference in ethnicity often implies the
influence of a different native language, but no such marked difference goes
with the difference in sex.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-008#X96:1>
Probably more important is that the women's personal achievements
affecting their language habits are not faithfully reflected in a SES
ranking.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-008#X97:1>
For instance, a woman graduate who is a full-time homemaker without
an income would rank lower in the SES scale than her peer who is holding a
professional job.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-008#X98:1>
The two could logically be exhibiting similar speech habits, but
their possible social class ranking would indicate that as an oddity.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-008#X99:1>
However, this may be more a problem with the method of social class
ranking, than with the concept of social class per se.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-008#X100:1>
<h> Age </h>

<ICE-SIN:W1A-008#X101:1>
More important than sex, seems to be a person's age in the effect
it has on language use in Singapore.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-008#X102:1>
Tay ( 1979) points out that literacy in Singapore, especially in
English, varies inversely with age.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-008#X103:1>
The younger the Singaporean, the greater the likelihood that he
understands English.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-008#X104:1>
Similarly while the older generations of Singapore Chinese tend to
have their native Chinese dialect in their verbal repertoire, young
Singaporeans, especially those aged fifteen and below are likely not to.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-008#X105:1>
Instead they are more likely to speak Mandarin where the native
Chinese dialects are used in their parents' generation.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-008#X106:1>
Both cases are results of penetrating implementation of language
policies in post independence Singapore.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-008#X107:1>
In the case of English, the policy concerned is the drive of the
post-independent government in providing young Singaporeans with educational
opportunities of which English learning is an integral part.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-008#X108:1>
In the case of Mandarin, it is the government's policy of promoting
the use of Mandarin in the place of the other Chinese dialects within the
Chinese community launched just over a decade ago.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-008#X109:1>
Policies do result in significant changes in Singapore in as soon
as a generation, due to the small physical size of the country, which
facilitates swift penetrating influence of the policies.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-008#X110:1>
Singaporeans separated by just the age of a generation could
exhibit quite different language habits.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-008#X111:1>
Age is certainly a factor which cannot be overlooked in a
sociolinguistic survey.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-008#X112:1>
<h> Conclusion </h>

<ICE-SIN:W1A-008#X113:1>
From the above discussion, social class proves to be too limited as
a concept to adequately capture the complex relationship between society and
language use in the multi-lingual, multi-ethnic society of Singapore.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-008#X114:1>
For unlike generally monolingual and mono-ethnic societies where
one language structure interacts with one social structure which is primarily
socio-economic in nature, in a multi-lingual and multi-ethnic society such as
Singapore, different language structures interact with the different facets
of society, from the ethnic to the socio-economic in the use of language.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-008#X115:1>
And, adding to the complexity in Singapore, is the pervasive
influence of top-down planning.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-008#X116:1>
A shift in language policy essentially leads to a change in the
pattern of language use over just one generation, at least at the general
level of the choice of languages or dialects.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-008#X117:1>
To overcome the complex diversity in the Singapore sociolinguistic
scene, it might be more useful looking at individuals rather than blocs of
the society.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-008#X118:1>
Milroy's concept of social network, with the individual as anchor,
might be a more useful concept in sociolinguistic surveys in Singapore.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-008#X119:1>
Following the suggestion of Milroy and Milroy ( 1992) perhaps the
findings at the micro level might then be explained within the macro
framework of a conflict-based social class model.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-008#X120:1>
The dichotomy of the society into the policy-making class and the
general population would quite neatly account for the tendency towards
top-down language habit changes in Singapore, where top-down planning seems
to be a way of life. </X> </I>
