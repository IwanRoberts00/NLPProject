<h> TRANSPORT CLAIM </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2D-004#96:5>
Under existing rules, a staff member who performs duty enroute
between his home and office and vice-versa may be paid duty transport
allowance for the distance which is more than the distance between his home
and office.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-004#97:5>
The reimbursement is currently based on the additional distance
travelled using the same mode of transport.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-004#98:5>
For example, if travel from home to place of duty, and from place of
duty to office are both by taxis, the amount to be reimbursed would be the
total taxi fares incurred for the 2 trips less the notional taxi-fare from
home to office ( even if the normal mode of travel to office is by personal
car).

<ICE-SIN:W2D-004#99:5>
With effect from 1 February 1993, a staff member who travels by taxi
or other means of public transport to perform duty en route between his home
and office, or vice versa, may be reimbursed the actual expenses for the
journey less his normal expenses for commuting between his home and office.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-004#100:5>
If he uses his own vehicle for the journey, the present practice of
paying him a transport allowance for the distance which is more than the
distance between his home and office, will continue.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-004#101:5>
The revised transport allowance claim form is attached for the use
of staff in your department.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-004#102:5>
If you need any clarification on the above, please call Ms Tew Woon
Ling at extension 2407.

SINGAPORE POLYTECHNIC Memorandum

<ICE-SIN:W2D-004#108:6>
To : All Full-Time and Part-Time Staff From: Delonix

<ICE-SIN:W2D-004#109:6>
Date : 31 July 1992

<ICE-SIN:W2D-004#110:6>
<h> TIMETABLES AND CLASSROOMS </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2D-004#111:6>
I have been receiving requests from some of you to change the time
of your classes.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-004#112:6>
I am sorry I have not been able to accede to most of the requests.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-004#113:6>
The problem lies with the venue.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-004#114:6>
Because of the increased student intake in recent years, the room
situation this year is particularly tight.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-004#115:6>
Since the departments have not been able to give rooms for your
alternative times, some of you have scouted around for rooms and suggested
some rooms.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-004#116:6>
Please note that the various academic departments have been
allocated rooms in different blocks.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-004#117:6>
For example, the Mechanical & Manufacturing ( MM) Department has
been allocated most of the rooms in Teaching Block 21, although the Business
Administration ( BA) Department and the Maritime Technology & Transportation
( MTT) Department have two rooms each in that Block.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-004#118:6>
These rooms are for the exclusive use of the " owner" departments.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-004#119:6>
We cannot, therefore, hold a class for the BA Department in a
classroom allocated to the MM Department without the approval of the latter
Department.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-004#120:6>
Also, the academic departments expect us to use the rooms given to
us for Language classes.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-004#121:6>
If you have left your room vacant for a long time because you are
teaching in a " better" room, the department will take the room for the use
of its own staff.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-004#122:6>
This will then leave you in a dilemma when you are asked to leave a
room which you have been using illegally.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-004#123:6>
Please, therefore, refrain from using any vacant room you see
because you run the risk of being asked to leave the room.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-004#124:6>
I would appreciate it if you could keep to the times and rooms given
to you.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-004#125:6>
Many thanks.

 Before students begin writing the essay in class, you can discuss
the outline with them.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-004#157:7>
 If you know of any articles from any sources that can help your
students in writing the essay, please feel free to share them with your
students.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-004#162:7>
 Remember : In this unit, students are to write an argumentative
