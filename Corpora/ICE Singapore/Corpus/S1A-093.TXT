And you are zapping what for them

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#31:1:C>
Grammar notes so they can like because they are not in a mood

<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#32:1:C>

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#33:1:A>

<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#34:1:C>

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#40:1:C>

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#42:1:C>
Uh huh

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#43:1:A>
And uh he says that most of his honours friends he can't
really can't say anything for them in in August and July

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#44:1:C>
Uh huh

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#45:1:A>
Uh huh ya

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#46:1:C>
I see

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#47:1:A>
Uhm uhm

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#48:1:C>
Well uhm but the permanent teacher and the principal hasn't
mentioned anything to me you see

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#49:1:A>
Uhm uhm

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#50:1:C>
So it's like kind of thick skin if I were to ask them

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#51:1:A>
Uhm

<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#52:1:A>
Actually I met Sim Lyn the other day

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#53:1:C>
Uh huh

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#54:1:A>
Uhm I was down at MPH and she was with Mike and she was buying
a wedding card

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#55:1:C>
Uh

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#56:1:A>
Have you seen her recently

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#57:1:C>
No

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#58:1:A>
Do you know that she's cut her hair really short

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#59:1:C>
That's what she's been telling me

<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#60:1:C>
That by the time I see her I think it wouldn't be that short any
more

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#61:1:A>
Uh huh

<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#62:1:A>
And she was saying that Mike doesn't like it that much and prefers
<unclear> word </unclear>

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#63:1:C>
Really

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#64:1:A>
He or rather no what she actually said was Oh uhm ya he he
says he can't really get used to it

<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#65:1:A>
And she said something to the effect of people prefer the previous
length

<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#66:1:A>
So by inference I took it that he didn't like it that much

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#67:1:C>
Oh I thought he liked it and I thought she said he liked it

<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#68:1:C>
I can't remember

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#69:1:A>
Uhm anyway it's very very fresh-looking but

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#70:1:C>
Very

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#71:1:A>
I don't know I still liked her with even-length hair

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#72:1:C>
See when I asked her she said she looked like Su

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#73:1:A>
Ya that's about <unclear> word </unclear> you know

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#74:1:C>
Uh huh

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#75:1:A>
Ya

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#76:1:C>
So that was when I really imagined it off the ears

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#77:1:A>
Uhm uhm uhm

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#78:1:C>
Oh did you know that I cut mine

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#79:1:A>
You mean since I saw you at at the SSO

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#80:1:C>
Uh huh and I told you I was going to cut it

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#81:1:A>
Oh gosh so you cut it <unclear> word </unclear>

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#82:1:C>
Uh huh it's the shortest I've ever had

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#83:1:A>
Oh no

<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#84:1:A>
Is it layered or is it even-length

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#85:1:C>
Uhm it's well I'm trying to keep it all over again so it's
it's levelled up to half my chin length and then it's a gradual slope down

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#86:1:A>
Oh I see

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#87:1:C>
Half my chin length

<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#88:1:C>
Uhm well it's you know what that means right

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#89:1:A>
I think I know what that means

<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#90:1:A>
Uhm uhm

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#91:1:C>
Uh

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#92:1:A>
Uhm Oh dear

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#93:1:C>
Aye

<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#94:1:C>
It happened a mixed bag of reactions

<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#95:1:C>
The the those who need it ones after the cut uh came from those who
liked it then after a while those who kept quiet are usually those who liked
long hair and the boys

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#96:1:A>
Oh I see

<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#97:1:A>

<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#104:1:C>

<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#105:1:C>
At that time it was their exam so I said Hey my hair is even
shorter than all of you

<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#230:1:A>
Oh dear so fun

<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#231:1:A>
The two of you would be in IE together

<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#232:1:C>
That is that is if she accepts it

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#233:1:A>

<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#243:1:A>
What are your main issues

<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#244:1:A>
I told her well I don't know

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#245:1:C>
Oh don't worry

<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#246:1:C>
That's what Patke asked me

<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#247:1:C>
At the end of my second draft

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#248:1:A>
Oh no

<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#249:1:A>
And it's rather demoralizing isn't it

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#250:1:C>
Sorry

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#251:1:A>
It is demoralizing

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#252:1:C>
Ya

<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#253:1:C>
It was very but after that it was okay

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#254:1:A>
Uhm okay

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#255:1:C>
Uh huh

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#256:1:A>
Uhm uhm

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#257:1:C>
So do you work on campus or do you work at home

<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#258:1:A>
Oh I work at home because of the computer but I just popped
down

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#259:1:C>
Uhm

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#260:1:A>
now and then

<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#261:1:A>

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#262:1:C>

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#263:1:A>
He's back uhm and apart from that I haven't seen anybody in
the department

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#264:1:C>
They're probably all on leave

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#265:1:A>
Yes Dawson is on leave I think

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#266:1:C>
Uhm uhm Dawson's always on leave

<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#267:1:A>
Uh huh

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#268:1:C>
During this time

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#269:1:A>
Uhm uhm

<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#270:1:A>
Probably back in Europe

<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#271:1:A>
At least I think so

<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#272:1:A>
I think I should think that he would want to go back to Europe

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#273:1:C>
That's nice

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#274:1:A>

<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#277:1:A>
Oh I met Bruce Martin the other day too

<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#278:1:A>

So I don't have to pay so many days

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#299:1:A>
Oh okay

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#300:1:C>
Uh huh

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#301:1:A>
Uhm uhm

<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#302:1:C>
You're going to be around

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#303:1:A>
I'm going to be around today

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#304:1:C>
<unclear> word </unclear>

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#305:1:A>
Yes and after that I really can't say

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#306:1:C>
Uhm uhm

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#307:1:A>
Uhm uhm

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#309:1:A>
Oh yes that oh that means she's been in the room

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#310:1:C>

Because you know I've got two tickets to <unclear> word
</unclear>

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#312:1:C>
Uh huh

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#313:1:A>
Uh huh because I I I got thirty dollar tickets and forty
dollar tickets

<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#314:1:A>
So I thought it's easier to sell off the thirty dollar tickets

<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#315:1:A>
And so I put up a notice on the board in the room

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#316:1:C>
Oh you mean you you made a duplicated <unclear> word
</unclear>

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#317:1:A>
Meaning I bought I had four tickets and I only needed two

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#318:1:C>
Oh dear

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#319:1:A>

<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#320:1:C>
Well you can try Kumu

<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#321:1:C>

<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#322:1:A>
Oh does she like ballet

<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#323:1:A>

<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#333:1:A>
Uhm

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#334:1:C>
Oh that's a thought

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#335:1:A>
It's up in the circle

<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#336:1:A>
Uhm one of my friends told me it's okay seats

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#337:1:C>
Uh huh

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#338:1:A>
Uhm I'll be going with Andrew on the same night

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#339:1:C>
Oh on the same night but different seats

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#340:1:A>
Yes

<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#341:1:A>
Uhm uhm just different seats

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#342:1:C>
Uhm

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#343:1:A>
And uhm ya it's at Kallang

<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#344:1:A>
It's at eight pm

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#345:1:C>
Oh it's the Romeo and Juliet one

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#346:1:A>
Uhm yes

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#347:1:C>
I was more attracted to the next bill

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#348:1:A>
Oh yes

<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#349:1:A>
The one with Transfigured Night but I think those are completely
sold out

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#350:1:C>
Uh huh ya

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#351:1:A>
Uhm uhm

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#352:1:C>
I thought it would be

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#353:1:A>
Uhm

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#354:1:C>
We tried

<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#355:1:C>
The only one my friends tried to get was the Dallas Symphony

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#356:1:A>
Oh and

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#357:1:C>
Tried to get

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#358:1:A>
Oh okay

<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#359:1:A>
Tried to get

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#360:1:C>
And then for the rest of it I thought oh give it a skip <X>

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#X361:1:A>
Uhm uhm Uhm I was talking to another friend who was telling
me oh he's going to see the Indonesian dance

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#X362:1:C>
Uhm uhm

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#X363:1:A>
in the gamallon and nuh he was saying and he was saying that
ya these are the tickets that are more available Then he says Singaporeans
are so snobbish

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#X364:1:C>
Uh

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#X365:1:A>
and I kind of shrivelled in my feet

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#X366:1:C>
No

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#X367:1:A>
Uhm

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#X368:1:C>
it's not that Singaporeans are snobbish that I think those
who are trained to those who go to ballets and all

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#X369:1:A>
Uhm uhm

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#X370:1:C>
and music halls they're all western classically-trained So
so I I think not exposed enough to indigenous cultural works you know

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#X371:1:A>
Uhm uhm ya

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#X372:1:C>
and well

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#X373:1:A>
Uhm uhm

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#X374:1:C>
Did I tell you once I went I went with my entire Bible study
group to The Glass Orchestra

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#X375:1:A>
The Glass Orchestra

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#X376:1:C>
Uh huh and because it's some um experimental group and
highly experimental and I kind of knew

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#X377:1:A>
Uhm

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#X378:1:C>
that I forgot you see So I said 'Why don't we all go ' and I
booked tickets for all of them and they almost died because

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#X379:1:A>
Oh

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#X380:1:C>
because the trained ones uh two most accomplished ones
almost died because it's like nothing orchestral that they know

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#X381:1:A>
It was that spaced out

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#X382:1:C>
Uh huh

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#X383:1:A>
Uhm

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#X384:1:C>
and like 'What orchestra ' It's all broken pieces of glass

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#X385:1:A>
Oh that's why it's called The Glass Orchestra

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#X386:1:C>
Ya so it's like actually they tried to pattern um the the
the glass instruments um most of which were fashioned themselves They tried
to to group them into the different sectors you know like the conventional
orchestra

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#X387:1:A>
Uhm uhm

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#X388:1:C>
according to I don't know the pitch or something

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#X389:1:A>
Uhm

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#X390:1:C>
and their works were original too So you've got to like
throw away all the conventional ways of listening and listen according to
rhythm you know

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#X391:1:A>
Uhm uhm

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#X392:1:C>
and I found it very interesting because I could pick out
when one movement ended or one piece ended and another girl who's like
absolutely tone-deaf sometimes and she's not trained you see and she's not
very exposed and she knew when it ended but the musician friends of mine my
goodness they just went 'To hell with it'

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#X393:1:A>
Was it bad Wasn't it enjoyable

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#X394:1:C>
Um it's enjoyable if you listen to it with a different ear

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#X395:1:A>
Uhm

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#X396:1:C>
So they were going 'I like Brahms so what am I doing '

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#X397:1:A>
Oh poor things

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#X398:1:C>
Ya but I was quite mad actually because it's like you're
you're just cloistered you know instead of broadening

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#X399:1:A>
Uhm uhm

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#X400:1:C>
Well uh different different ideas and I think all that talk
all that reading up on post-modernism help

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#X401:1:A>
Uhm uhm Uhm

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#X402:1:C>

Ya I kind of <unclear> word </unclear>

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#X413:1:A>
How in the world do you transcribe giggles Do you just skip

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#X414:1:C>
Ya wow wee she's going to have a lot of brackets

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-093#X415:1:A>
