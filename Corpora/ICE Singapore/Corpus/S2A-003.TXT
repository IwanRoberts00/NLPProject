<ICE-SIN:S2A-003#1:1:A>
As we see the table with Singapore languishing at the bottom
China is already through to the finals in Hiroshima in October this year

<ICE-SIN:S2A-003#2:1:A>
Singapore the familiar all white

<ICE-SIN:S2A-003#3:1:A>
China in red very familiar red tops

<ICE-SIN:S2A-003#4:1:A>
Well this should be a face-saving match for caber checks boys

<ICE-SIN:S2A-003#5:1:A>
We will also use this game to prepare for the up-coming semi-pro
league competition to start in May

<ICE-SIN:S2A-003#6:1:A>
In fact uh to be precise uh they'll kick off on the ninth of May

<ICE-SIN:S2A-003#7:1:A>
The semi-pro league against Pahang

<ICE-SIN:S2A-003#8:1:A>
That's Chiupo on the ball for China and straight away they get down
to business

<ICE-SIN:S2A-003#9:1:A>
Weiguo Depamanathan for Singapore

<ICE-SIN:S2A-003#10:1:A>
Oh that's Kannan

<ICE-SIN:S2A-003#11:1:A>
He has come down

<ICE-SIN:S2A-003#12:1:A>
Looks like Kannan is gonna be take away quite a fair bit in the
defence as well

<ICE-SIN:S2A-003#13:1:A>
Caber checks has uh resorted to zonal defence as oppose to applying
the men to men system today

<ICE-SIN:S2A-003#14:1:A>
The Chinese are really very good ball players and they just enjoy
running at the defenders

<ICE-SIN:S2A-003#15:1:A>
They've got tremendous pace and the Singapore boys just can't
afford to apply the men to men system here so it's got to be zonal defence
for Singapore

<ICE-SIN:S2A-003#16:1:A>
Into the pourri comes Chuipo

<ICE-SIN:S2A-003#17:1:A>
Good cross and out it goes on the head of uh Maichiao

<ICE-SIN:S2A-003#18:1:A>
That's Maichiao for you

<ICE-SIN:S2A-003#19:1:A>
He's been outstanding in this group for qualifying round
competition for the Asian Cup

<ICE-SIN:S2A-003#20:1:A>
Pakma the Singapore captain

<ICE-SIN:S2A-003#21:1:A>
Noor Halishafik Haslim trying to take over from where Kannan was uh
Kannan left off and of course Kannan will was foul in the process

<ICE-SIN:S2A-003#22:1:A>
Free kick given to Singapore

<ICE-SIN:S2A-003#23:1:A>
The first infringement committed in the game

<ICE-SIN:S2A-003#24:1:A>
And China snugged that one out so very easily

<ICE-SIN:S2A-003#25:1:A>
Chuipo leaving it for Pengwa

<ICE-SIN:S2A-003#26:1:A>
Upfront for Chienli and Pama tidying up the back for Singapore

<ICE-SIN:S2A-003#27:1:A>
Rozali

<ICE-SIN:S2A-003#28:1:A>
That was Nazri looking for uh Devaraj on the far side

<ICE-SIN:S2A-003#29:1:A>
China is represented by a team from the Guangtong province
strengthening the goal-lead three players from Beijing

<ICE-SIN:S2A-003#30:1:A>
They've already settled down and they're beginning to dictate turns

<ICE-SIN:S2A-003#31:1:A>
On the near side for the Asian all-star player Yishin and uh very
quickly put to touch by a Singapore defender throw-in to the People's
Republic of China

<ICE-SIN:S2A-003#32:1:A>
Chiupo

<ICE-SIN:S2A-003#33:1:A>
Yishin

<ICE-SIN:S2A-003#34:1:A>
Yishin once again still checking position for China but Norhaliz
was there

<ICE-SIN:S2A-003#35:1:A>
He read that very very quickly

<ICE-SIN:S2A-003#36:1:A>
Throw-in for Chuipo

<ICE-SIN:S2A-003#37:1:A>
Yishin

<ICE-SIN:S2A-003#38:1:A>
Haslim the boss and out it goes

<ICE-SIN:S2A-003#39:1:A>
David says leave it for a goal kick

<ICE-SIN:S2A-003#40:1:A>
That's Wu chuenli one of the leading goal getters for the People's
Republic of China

<ICE-SIN:S2A-003#41:1:A>
Well after failing to qualify for the nineteen ninety World Cup and
the nineteen ninety-two Olympic games China has decided to go through a
rebuilding programme starting with this Asian Cup competition and they're
well on their way to the final in Hiroshima this October

<ICE-SIN:S2A-003#42:1:A>
Rozali Saad for Singapore now

<ICE-SIN:S2A-003#43:1:A>
And hopefully we should be there to bring you all the action

<ICE-SIN:S2A-003#44:1:A>
Nasri Rozali gaining control of the ball giving position to the
People's Republic of China once again

<ICE-SIN:S2A-003#45:1:A>
Eddy Kum tearing back into the Singapore defence now

<ICE-SIN:S2A-003#46:1:A>
Weiguo over to Mengwa

<ICE-SIN:S2A-003#47:1:A>
Chaoyang Chiupo

<ICE-SIN:S2A-003#48:1:A>
He's another one of those stars for this uh Chinese side playing
for his country for many years now

<ICE-SIN:S2A-003#49:1:A>
Another goal kick to Singapore and it's a question of time as to
how long the boys will be able to weather the storm with the Chinese applying
early pressure already in this match

<ICE-SIN:S2A-003#50:1:A>
The outcome certainly has got no bearings on their qualifying for
the finals but still they would like to go up out of the competition with a
clean slate winning all their matches against Indonesia Malaysia and now
Singapore

<ICE-SIN:S2A-003#51:1:A>
Free kick to Singapore to be taken by Zukifli Catiomo and the
players move up now the white shirts go to the top of the Chinese penalty box

<ICE-SIN:S2A-003#52:1:A>
Devaraj turning it round <unclear> word </unclear>

<ICE-SIN:S2A-003#53:1:A>
Tim no problems whatsoever for O Chiuliang

<ICE-SIN:S2A-003#54:1:A>
Mengwa

<ICE-SIN:S2A-003#55:1:A>
Chiupo Chaoyang

<ICE-SIN:S2A-003#56:1:A>
When we talk about total football just watch this Chinese team
players who are slated down to play in mid-field there

<ICE-SIN:S2A-003#57:1:A>
Down to defence there up in the striker's position in the next
moment they're all over

<ICE-SIN:S2A-003#58:1:A>
Each and everyone of these players in this uh Chinese side put in a
lot uh hard work

<ICE-SIN:S2A-003#59:1:A>
Tremendous work rate here displayed by these Chinese boys

<ICE-SIN:S2A-003#60:1:A>
And Singapore conceding a corner

<ICE-SIN:S2A-003#61:1:A>
Teng Weiguo to lift the ball from the corner blight <unclear> word
</unclear>

<ICE-SIN:S2A-003#62:1:A>
Good sliding tackle by Elsri getting Singapore out of trouble

<ICE-SIN:S2A-003#63:1:A>
Haslim Ipichil looking for Devaraj and now Nasri

<ICE-SIN:S2A-003#64:1:A>
Good cover by Mengwa

<ICE-SIN:S2A-003#65:1:A>
Ai zhiao

<ICE-SIN:S2A-003#66:1:A>
Said Devaraj and the boys in their eagerness to try and take
control of the game seem to be making a lot of mistakes and uh giving away
possession to China

<ICE-SIN:S2A-003#67:1:A>
From Said Shuko to Rozali

<ICE-SIN:S2A-003#68:1:A>
Saad back to Said Shuko

<ICE-SIN:S2A-003#69:1:A>
Basically a stopper he seems to be the rightful back position

<ICE-SIN:S2A-003#70:1:A>
Caber check they still using his three two three two formation but
they've got to be a lot tighter in defence applying of course the zonal
defence to try and shut up the Chinese attack

<ICE-SIN:S2A-003#71:1:A>
Chee Mengwa Liyong Chineng

<ICE-SIN:S2A-003#72:1:A>
Oh that's Chaoyang

<ICE-SIN:S2A-003#73:1:A>
Yijeng

<ICE-SIN:S2A-003#74:1:A>
Mengwa

<ICE-SIN:S2A-003#75:1:A>
Chuipo they're trying to draw the Singapore forwards <unclear> word
</unclear> of the Singapore players toward them before trying to prize open
the defence looking for gaps in the Singapore defence and they've conceded
another corner <unclear> word </unclear>

<ICE-SIN:S2A-003#76:1:A>
That one in Hasmil gets it away

<ICE-SIN:S2A-003#77:1:A>
Kannan keeping his balance very nicely there despite the challenge
and here's Haslim Harun

<ICE-SIN:S2A-003#78:1:A>
Yes he's got an option there in the person of Nasri

<ICE-SIN:S2A-003#79:1:A>
Devaraj asking for for the ball but Nasri decides to hit for goal
and the ball has gone out for a goal kick to the People's Republic of China

<ICE-SIN:S2A-003#80:1:A>
Good attempt by Nasari Nasir and the Chinese come back once again

<ICE-SIN:S2A-003#81:1:A>
It is pretty evident that the Chinese are holding back

<ICE-SIN:S2A-003#82:1:A>
They're just waiting for the right ball to strike and the Singapore
defenders especially will have to be very very weary

<ICE-SIN:S2A-003#83:1:A>
They knocked the ball around in the middle of the field but when
they get it to the <unclear> word </unclear> third of the field they will
just accelerate their pace and great focal

<ICE-SIN:S2A-003#84:1:A>
Halim for Singapore looking for support

<ICE-SIN:S2A-003#85:1:A>
He gets it from Devaraj and good return to Haslim and he's got one
player to beat with two others coming back and that's Chuiliang making sure
although that ball looked destined to go out for a goal kick but Chuiliang
nevertheless went down for that

<ICE-SIN:S2A-003#86:1:A>
Slow build-up as usual

<ICE-SIN:S2A-003#87:1:A>
Chaoyang very nicely taken there away by Tonghai it comes back once
again to Weiguo on the outside for Chaoyang and David gets to the ball first
ahead of Chienli

<ICE-SIN:S2A-003#88:1:A>
Zukifli

<ICE-SIN:S2A-003#89:1:A>
Tonghai

<ICE-SIN:S2A-003#90:1:A>
We see a lot of central defenders in the Singapore today

<ICE-SIN:S2A-003#91:1:A>
In fact uh the defence is made up essentially of uh central
defenders

<ICE-SIN:S2A-003#92:1:A>
There's Depamanathan who is uh playing the sweeper's role

<ICE-SIN:S2A-003#93:1:A>
Then there's Lim Tonghai Said Shuko Noor Halishafik and Rozali Saad

<ICE-SIN:S2A-003#94:1:A>
They're all central defenders

<ICE-SIN:S2A-003#95:1:A>
This Chinese squad has been under intensive training in uh
Guangzhou in preparation for this competition

<ICE-SIN:S2A-003#96:1:A>
And as part of their preparations they played against the United
States and Canada losing five nil to the US team and five two to Canada

<ICE-SIN:S2A-003#97:1:A>
But uh as we've seen they're they're all set to give a good account
of themselves in Hiroshima

<ICE-SIN:S2A-003#98:1:A>
Yes the team comes from Guangtong but uh their preparations were in
Guangzhou

<ICE-SIN:S2A-003#99:1:A>
They've got only three players from Beijing in this squad

<ICE-SIN:S2A-003#100:1:A>
Chiupo forward to Chienli

<ICE-SIN:S2A-003#101:1:A>
Yishin this is Yishin

<ICE-SIN:S2A-003#102:1:A>
Pamanathan yes Pamanathan playing a real captain's game

<ICE-SIN:S2A-003#103:1:A>
Tonghai

<ICE-SIN:S2A-003#104:1:A>
Noor Haliz back to David Lee and the Singapore defenders are
certainly taking their chances there in the defensive third of the field
knocking the ball around

<ICE-SIN:S2A-003#105:1:A>
They sure look pretty confident with their skills

<ICE-SIN:S2A-003#106:1:A>
Gone away with that one especially in the face of the fast running
Yishin

<ICE-SIN:S2A-003#107:1:A>
Yishin once again Noor Haliz trying to get to the ball first but
he was prevented from doing so good shielding by Yishin and of course he was
pulled off for tackling from behind so a free kick given to the People's
Republic of China

<ICE-SIN:S2A-003#108:1:A>
They push most of their players up into the Singapore penalty box
Said goes up with that one and Tonghai the second time

<ICE-SIN:S2A-003#109:1:A>
Tonghai once again and out it goes for a goal kick to Singapore

<ICE-SIN:S2A-003#110:1:A>
Noor Haliz he was rested in uh Singapore's last match against
Indonesia

<ICE-SIN:S2A-003#111:1:A>
Said Devaraj

<ICE-SIN:S2A-003#112:1:A>
Rozali Saad the Chinese players are extremely fast

<ICE-SIN:S2A-003#113:1:A>
You see them putting the pressure on the Singapore players in the
middle of the pitch

<ICE-SIN:S2A-003#114:1:A>
They don't allow the Singapore players to get into their penalty
area before they shut them out

<ICE-SIN:S2A-003#115:1:A>
They shut them out right there in the middle of the <unclear> word
</unclear>

<ICE-SIN:S2A-003#116:1:A>
They apply the pressure all the away

<ICE-SIN:S2A-003#117:1:A>
They don't give the Singapore boys room to manoeuvre

<ICE-SIN:S2A-003#118:1:A>
And Chineng just gave that away and I'm sure the Singapore
defenders are grateful for that

<ICE-SIN:S2A-003#119:1:A>
Goal kick to Singapore

<ICE-SIN:S2A-003#120:1:A>
We've got about fifteen minutes of play gone by and still
Singapore is still holding their on

<ICE-SIN:S2A-003#121:1:A>
No goals at the moment

<ICE-SIN:S2A-003#122:1:A>
Interception by Chuipo Tonghai comes back and Pama gears for
Nazarene

<ICE-SIN:S2A-003#123:1:A>
Haslim

<ICE-SIN:S2A-003#124:1:A>
Haslim once again

<ICE-SIN:S2A-003#125:1:A>
Kannan's making his move

<ICE-SIN:S2A-003#126:1:A>
He leaves the ball off the side

<ICE-SIN:S2A-003#127:1:A>
He gets it from Razali and now Kannan in possession

<ICE-SIN:S2A-003#128:1:A>
You see how the Chinese players cover all those passing and those
making it very very difficult for the player on the ball to look for his
team-mates

<ICE-SIN:S2A-003#129:1:A>
Pamanathan sending that one to the middle of the box and it's get
away to safety

<ICE-SIN:S2A-003#130:1:A>
Oh good play by Devaraj

<ICE-SIN:S2A-003#131:1:A>
He's through a promising move there by Dedevaraj and he certainly
raise the hopes of the twenty thousand fan here at the National Stadium at
least for a moment as Singapore move into the offensive and uh very nearly
made something out of that move

<ICE-SIN:S2A-003#132:1:A>
The Singapore boys will have to be uh a lot more assured

<ICE-SIN:S2A-003#133:1:A>
Tonghai with a big header

<ICE-SIN:S2A-003#134:1:A>
A tackle by Said

<ICE-SIN:S2A-003#135:1:A>
Said Shuko giving away a free kick to China

<ICE-SIN:S2A-003#136:1:A>
He certainly had his eye Maichiao couldn't allow Maichiao to take
control of the ball

<ICE-SIN:S2A-003#137:1:A>
This is the man who orchestrate all the goals for China

<ICE-SIN:S2A-003#138:1:A>
Weiguo still taking possession Ai chao slip that one in to number
six Yichun

<ICE-SIN:S2A-003#139:1:A>
Good play by Depamanathan Norhaliz

<ICE-SIN:S2A-003#140:1:A>
Kannan to Haslim Tonghai switching play to Saad Shuko

<ICE-SIN:S2A-003#141:1:A>
Pakma Devaraj and Devaraj committing an error there couldn't
decide which way the ball was going

<ICE-SIN:S2A-003#142:1:A>
Very good one-touch play by the Chinese

<ICE-SIN:S2A-003#143:1:A>
They're running off

<ICE-SIN:S2A-003#144:1:A>
The ball is certainly a treat for all soccer fans

<ICE-SIN:S2A-003#145:1:A>
Get the ball hit it and then run into <unclear> word </unclear>
spaces for the return

<ICE-SIN:S2A-003#146:1:A>
Said Shuko was there

<ICE-SIN:S2A-003#147:1:A>
Chuipo with the throw-in

<ICE-SIN:S2A-003#148:1:A>
Pamanathan reads the game very very well

<ICE-SIN:S2A-003#149:1:A>
Noor Haliz did a bit of playing

<ICE-SIN:S2A-003#150:1:A>
David I'm sure will want to acquit himself well today as he says
that this is gonna be his swan song

<ICE-SIN:S2A-003#151:1:A>
Noor Haliz glad to be playing in the left pull back position with
uh Saad Shuko taking care of the rightful back position

<ICE-SIN:S2A-003#152:1:A>
The Chinese coming back once again

<ICE-SIN:S2A-003#153:1:A>
Yijun

<ICE-SIN:S2A-003#154:1:A>
Noor Haliz

<ICE-SIN:S2A-003#155:1:A>
Very careful play there by Noor Haliz and he decides to draw
<unclear> word </unclear> for a goal

<ICE-SIN:S2A-003#156:1:A>
David Lee stopping that

<ICE-SIN:S2A-003#157:1:A>
Almost off the line and he hit upright

<ICE-SIN:S2A-003#158:1:A>
A good attempt there by Li Chaoyang

<ICE-SIN:S2A-003#159:1:A>
We'll watch the action replay on that one

<ICE-SIN:S2A-003#160:1:A>
A chance given to Chaoyang by Noor Haliz

<ICE-SIN:S2A-003#161:1:A>
He went for goal

<ICE-SIN:S2A-003#162:1:A>
Fortunately David was in corner of that time and he prevented
China from taking the lead

<ICE-SIN:S2A-003#163:1:A>
Back to play and China given a free kick and that was because uh
Said Shuko uh tackled one of the Chinese players from behind so a free kick
given to the People's Republic of China

<ICE-SIN:S2A-003#164:1:A>
The Singapore boys are all down into their defence

<ICE-SIN:S2A-003#165:1:A>
No one is up even Kannan and there's Devaraj in front their kicker

<ICE-SIN:S2A-003#166:1:A>
Liyong Rozali gave that away

<ICE-SIN:S2A-003#167:1:A>
Oh and here's the danger man failing to keep in playing

<ICE-SIN:S2A-003#168:1:A>
That's uh Xie Yishin

<ICE-SIN:S2A-003#169:1:A>
The twenty-three year old Yishin who has been kept sixty-three
times for his country Asian all-star material and now Singapore get
possession <X>

<ICE-SIN:S2A-003#X170:1:A>
Tonghai it's gonna be difficult to break this Chinese defence
down that's what the Singapore boys are trying to do </X> </I>
