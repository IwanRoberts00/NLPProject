<h> Companies offered in-house psychiatric therapy service </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2C-020#3:1>
IS THERE a psychiatrist in the house?

<ICE-SIN:W2C-020#4:1>
Companies would be able to say yes to this question if they take up an
in-house counselling and psychiatric therapy service now on offer.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-020#5:1>
Ernst and Young Consultants is selling this service as part of a
wellness programme to companies in the banking and financial services, public
relations and electronic manufacturing.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-020#6:1>
Said one of the architects of the programme, executive consultant
Catherine Sim: " Our targets are our existing clients, mostly MNCs.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-020#7:1>
Quite a few have expressed interest in it."

<ICE-SIN:W2C-020#8:1>
Ernst and Young Consultants provide management consultancy services to
both public and private hospitals here.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-020#9:1>
Said Dr Alison Tan, the other executive consultant in the scheme: " We
have a vast network of professionals medical doctors, psychiatrists, family
therapists and counselors." Employees who have problems coping with family
responsibilities, or, are going through a mid-life crisis, or are just plain
fed up with work, can get advice from in-house counsellors and psychiatrists
if their companies subscribe to the service.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-020#10:1>
The wellness programme is designed to improve employees' total
well-being.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-020#11:1>
Professional counselling is one of a 10-module package covering
topics like jobstress management strategies and retirement planning.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-020#12:1>
Miss Sim explained: " We'll have an on-site counsellor at the company
premises for a few sessions a week.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-020#13:1>
" Whoever needs counselling can just make an appointment to see the
counsellor or psychiatrist in their company premises."

<ICE-SIN:W2C-020#14:1>
Firms can also choose instead to have a list of appointed counsellors
in private practice or employees to visit, she added.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-020#15:1>
The counsellor may be a social worker, psychiatrist, a clinical
psychologist or even a family therapist.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-020#16:1>
The first 45 minute session costs between
&dollar;80 to
&dollar;120. 

<ICE-SIN:W2C-020#17:1>
Subsequent sessions of between half an hour and 5 minutes range
between
&dollar;5O to
&dollar;90. 

<ICE-SIN:W2C-020#18:1>
Companies which subscribe to the service can either bear the
full cost, subsidise it, or make the service part of a flexible benefits
system.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-020#19:1>
Under such a system, employees can pick from a buffet of benefits
which could include professional counselling.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-020#20:1>
Miss Sim said: " Our immediate target are those in middle management
who may be more aware and receptive to such help.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-020#21:1>
At the lower levels, we'll start with physical health awareness
first, then proceed to mental health." Right now, some big companies here
already have some form of employee wellness programmes.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-020#22:1>
Pharmaceutical company Johnson and Johnson's " Live For Life"
programme focuses on a healthy lifestyle in the work place.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-020#23:1>
Other companies like Great Eastern Life and NTUC Income also adopt
the same programme for their employees.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-020#24:1>
Hewlet Packard has a four-year-old programme covering areas like
health education and stress management.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-020#25:1>
But no company is believed to have an in-house professional
Counselling service yet.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-020#26:1>
Mr Suprabim Bose, managing director of Johnson and Johnson, said: "
We provide only outside counselling.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-020#27:1>
As of now, we haven't got into a situation that requires an in-house
service."

<ICE-SIN:W2C-020#28:1>
Miss Prema Govindan, the Wellness programme manager at Hewlett
Packard, added: " The employee support programmes we have at the moment are
sufficient.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-020#29:1>
l don't see a need for it at this point." In-house counselling as
part of an Employees Assistance Programme has proved very useful in the US,
said Dr Y C.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-020#30:1>
Lim, a consultant psychiatrist in private practice, who has worked in
the United States.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-020#31:1>
He said: 'There, problems of alcohol and drug abuse are quite
rampant.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-020#32:1>
Counselling has proved useful as a preventive strategy for companies.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-020#33:1>
It's also quite cost effective in the long term." But will it catch
on here?

<ICE-SIN:W2C-020#34:1>
Miss Sim is optimistic.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-020#35:1>
She said: " We're anticipating the need for it.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-020#36:1>
People will became more receptive to it with increasing awareness."

<h> No defects in tape that ran out, says Konica </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2C-020#38:2>
<h> NTSC signals take up more space, hence the shortfall </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2C-020#39:2>

<ICE-SIN:W2C-020#40:2>
TRY recording a two-hour movie from a laser disc onto a two-hour
video tape and the video tape will run out before the movie ends.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-020#41:2>
Not many people know this, and video tape manufacturers do not carry
any warnings about it on the cover of their tapes.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-020#42:2>
The tapes will run out because most laserdisc movies available here
use the NTSC format an American colour-scanning system which has a faster
tape running speed than the PAL system which is used here.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-020#43:2>
The NTSC system is used by countries like the United States, Taiwan,
the Philippines and Japan.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-020#44:2>
The PAL system is used in Britain, Hongkong, Singapore and Malaysia.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-020#45:2>
A third system, Secam, is used by some European countries like France
and Russia.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-020#46:2>
Lawyer Goh Kok Yeow, 32, found out that recording NTSC-format movies
uses more tape when he tried recording a laser-disc movie with a Konica VHS
E-l20 tape on his multi-system video recorder, which can record and play back
movies in the NTSC mode.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-020#47:2>
An ordinary video recorder cannot do that.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-020#48:2>
But when he later used the same tape to record a two hour TV movie,
the 120 minute Konica tape ran out before the movie ended.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-020#49:2>
The irate Mr Goh called The Straits Times, which then tested four
Konica tapes.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-020#50:2>
One was found to be only 109 minutes long, 11 minutes short of the
stated 120 minutes.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-020#51:2>
This tape, together with Mr Goh's were handed over to Konica
Singapore which then sent them to Japan for more tests.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-020#52:2>
The results, according to its general manager, Mr Arthur Ting, showed
that the two tapes were not defective.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-020#53:2>
Mr Ting said: " Lengthwise, the tapes are fine.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-020#54:2>
We measured them, and both meet the standards." One tape was 173.33
metre long, while the other was 173.18 m.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-020#55:2>
The standard length for a two-hour tape, according to Mr Kazuyuki
Yamamoto, the assistant to the managing director, is 173 m.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-020#56:2>
Manufacturers usually could give an extra of up to 0.33 m.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-020#57:2>
Mr Goh's tape ran short because tests showed that both PAL and NTSC
signals were in it.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-020#58:2>
For the same duration, NTSC signals take up more tape space than PAL.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-020#59:2>
The combined length for both the NTSC and PAL signals added up to
174.61m on the tape, longer than the maximum 173.33.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-020#60:2>
The total recording time on the other hand, is only 101 minutes, 19
minutes short of the 120 stated on the tape.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-020#61:2>
To solve the problem, users can buy multi-system video recorders
which have a long-play mode.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-020#62:2>
This will more than double the recording time of a video tape, but
the quality, according to Mr Yamamoto, is not as good.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-020#63:2>
As for The Straits Times' tape, Mr Yamamoto said there were no PAL or
NTSC signals on it to determine its running speed.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-020#64:2>
He attributed this to a possible fault in the video recorder that was
used to record TV programmes on this tape.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-020#65:2>
Konica added that it has proper quality control systems for its tapes
and it tries its best to make sure its products are in good condition.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-020#66:2>
Buyers want warning label, tape makers see no urgency.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-020#67:2>
IF PAL video tapes can record only 70 per cent of a programme in the
NTSC format, why not stick a label on them to warn customers?

<ICE-SIN:W2C-020#68:2>
Five tape manufacturers who spoke to The Straits Times felt that
there is no need because people who record from NTSC-format laser discs are
a minority, although several customers felt otherwise.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-020#69:2>
A spokesman for TDK said: " We have had no complaints from our
customers so far." Kodak said it has not encountered such problems either.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-020#70:2>
National Panasonic, Sony, Kodak and TDK also said they will consider
adding the relevant information only if more consumers demand it.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-020#71:2>
Konica's managing director Yasuji Nakaone said: " We'll consider it
if the need arises." Added Konica's general manager, Mr Arthur Ting: " We
don't want to confuse our customers with too much information on the tape
cover." But several customers disagreed.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-020#72:2>
Said shop assistant Karen Lim, in her twenties: " We're not so
stupid.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-020#73:2>
If they explain it clearly and print the instructions clearly, it'll
help." Lawyer Goh Kok Yeow, 32, whose complaint started the check on Konica
tapes added " I don't think such information will confuse.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-020#74:2>
A table showing the differences will definitely be very useful for
consumers like me." A spokesman for Asia Matsushita Electric, which
distributes the National Panasonic tapes, said there is a shift from TV
recording to laser disc dubbing and additional information may become
necessary." </I>

<h> Muscling through with looks and brains </h>

WHAT are a doctor, banker and engineer doing sauntering around in
their swimming trunks?

<ICE-SIN:W2C-020#78:3>
Clue: They are not going for a dip.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-020#79:3>
The three are part of a growing number of professionals taking part
in the quest for the ultimate man the Manhunt pageant.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-020#80:3>
All three are finalists in the contest.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-020#81:3>
The doctor, former Anglo-Chinese School student Rohan Mendis, 25,
entered because he wanted to keep up the ACS spirit of doing the
unconventional.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-020#82:3>
Banker Kenneth Tan, 25, from rival school St Joseph's Institution,
wanted glamour.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-020#83:3>
And engineer Timothy Wang, 27, from St Gabriel's Secondary School,
just wanted to expand his social circle.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-020#84:3>
Said Ms Mallika Joseph, the public relations manager for the contest
organisers, Metromedia Marketing: " A few undergraduates and professionals
have been getting into the finals, and this has attracted more of their peers
and has given Manhunt more respectability." When the pageant began as a male
model search in 1988, it attracted only 90 contestants - mostly students and
national servicemen.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-020#85:3>
About 45 of this year's crop of more than 300 are professionals.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-020#86:3>
The men, aged between 17 and 27, are judged on how they look in
swimwear to assess their physique, and in evening wear to rate their fashion
sense and poise.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-020#87:3>
The judges also interview them to gauge their personalities.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-020#88:3>
The finals of the contest will be held on June 25 at the Orchard
Hotel.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-020#89:3>
Two years ago, a senior manhunt segment was added for men above 28.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-020#90:3>
Bank manager Joseph D'aranjo, last year's senior manhunt winner, is
quick to point out that this is not a competition for male bimbos.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-020#91:3>
" It doesn't just depend on your looks," said the 33-year-old.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-020#92:3>
'You have to be able to conduct a decent conversation, be logical and
current on world events.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-020#93:3>
Last year, the judges asked me about the impact of the Earth Summit
in Rio de Janeiro." And yes, the doctor, banker and engineer look after their
brains as well as their bodies.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-020#94:3>
The three, avid sportsmen, also make sure they keep up with their
reading.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-020#95:3>
Dr Mendis, who is currently working at the Jurong Polyclinic, likes
Roald Dahl's books for their wit and humour.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-020#96:3>
He also likes the animated movie Aladdin for the same reason.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-020#97:3>
Many people, he said, centre their lives around their jobs.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-020#98:3>
He would rather keep himself open to new experiences.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-020#99:3>
" Life," he said, breaking into a shy smile, " should not be taken
too seriously." </I>

<h> Forge proof NDP tickets </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2C-020#101:4>
This year's National Day Parade tickets will come with security
measures to prevent counterfeiters from scanning or photocopying them.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-020#102:4>
Although no one has been caught with fake NDP tickets so far, the
organisers said the features were meant to deter potential forgers.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-020#103:4>
They were concerned because last year, some people offered to sell
their free tickets for
&dollar;100 over the Internet.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-020#104:4>
At a briefing yesterday, Brigadier-General Andrew Tan, chairman of
the parade's executive committee, said that this year, the venues for
distributing the tickets would be made known only on July 9, two days before
the counters open on July 11.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-020#105:4>
This is because organisrs do not want people to camp at the venues
days before the distribution date.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-020#106:4>
Each person can collect either two tickets for the National Day
Parade on Aug 9 or four tickets for the preview on July 31.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-020#107:4>
About 56,000 tickets will be available for each day.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-020#108:4>
But the committee is looking to increase the seating capacity by
adding more portable rows of seats on both sides of the sheltered VIP seats.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-020#109:4>
This wil allow a few thousand more spectators into the stadium.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-020#110:4>
Apart from the usual goodie bag, ticket-holders will be given a
commemorative MRT card which will give them free rides to and from the
parade. <X>

<ICE-SIN:W2C-020#X111:4>
Brig-Gen Tan encrouaged spectators to dress in the national red and
white colours, which will be indicated on their tickets, during the parade.
