<ICE-SIN:W2A-024#4:1>
There is now a large and growing literature on the biological
characteristics and features of tropical rain forests.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-024#5:1>
In this section only the salient aspects that have a bearing on the
issues to be discussed later will be described.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-024#6:1>
Schimper's ( 1903) description of tropical rain forest as a forest
which is 'evergreen, hygrophilous in character, at least 30 metres high, rich
in thick stemmed lianes, and in woody as well as herbaceous epiphytes'
remains in general use today.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-024#7:1>
It describes the vegetation which covers the lowland areas of the
tropics where temperatures are high and rainfall heavy, and where there is no
marked dry season.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-024#8:1>
Such lowland humid tropical areas make up less than one third of the
tropical land surface ( Ewel, 1980).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-024#9:1>
The largest expanses of tropical rain forest are in the equatorial
belt but outliers occur northwards and southwards of the equator ( Whitmore,
1984).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-024#10:1>
The main areas of tropical rain forest are: South and Central
America-The Amazon basin, with outliers north along the eastern side of
Central America, south to the Gran Chaco, east to the Guianas, and west to
the Andean foothills.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-024#11:1>
Africa - The Congo basin, largely Zaire and Congo, but including
Gabon and Cameroon.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-024#12:1>
It extends west to cover parts of Nigeria, Ghana, Ivory Coast,
Liberia and Guinea, and east to Uganda.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-024#13:1>
Asia - The countries of insular Southeast Asia, with extensions east
to Papua New Guinea, and north to parts of continental Southeast Asia, and
northwest to parts of Myanmar, Sri Lanka and India.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-024#14:1>
In general, rainfall becomes more seasonal with distance from the
equator, and in those parts of the tropics with a distinct dry season, the
tropical rain forest gives way to tropical moist deciduous forest.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-024#15:1>
Drier areas are covered by dry deciduous forest.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-024#16:1>
Figure 1.1 shows the distribution of potential tropical rain forest
and the countries with such forest.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-024#17:1>
This pattern of forest type distribution is governed by the pattern
of macroclimates, which, in any one tropical region, is in turn determined by
its position in relation to the continental land masses, air-streams and
air-flow and the influence of sea and ocean currents.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-024#18:1>
There is no distinct boundary between the tropical rain forest and
the tropical moist deciduous forest.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-024#19:1>
At the edges of its distribution the rain forest merges into semi-
evergreen rain forest and then into moist deciduous forest ( Mabberley,
1983).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-024#20:1>
Schimper ( 1903) describes the moist deciduous forest of Asia (
monsoon forest) as 'more or less leafless during the dry season, especially
towards its termination, tropophilous in character, rich in woody lianes,
rich in herbaceous but poor in woody epiphytes'.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-024#21:1>
This vegetational seamlessness makes it very difficult to measure the
areas under tropical rain forest, narrowly defined, and those under moist
deciduous forest.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-024#22:1>
The term 'tropical moist forest' ( TMF) is currently being used to
cover both forest types.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-024#23:1>
Based on remote sensing and other methods, the potential TMF land has
been calculated to be about 16 million km ( Myers, 1979).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-024#24:1>
An earlier estimate has put the tropical rain forest component at 8.3
million km - 4 million in tropical America, 2.5 million in Africa, and 1.8
million in tropical Asia ( Pringle, 1969).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-024#25:1>
It is possible to reconstruct the ancient history of tropical rain
forest from tossil evidence and the techniques of modern ecology.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-024#26:1>
Broadly, the early tropical forests were the coal-swamp forests of
the Upper Cretaceous of Europe and North America, which then had an
equatorial climate.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-024#27:1>
During the Permian climatic conditions, specifically increasing
aridity, led to the disappearance of these forests and their replacement by
the next group of tropical forests - the conifers, the modern representatives
of which are the giant Araucaria species of the western Pacific.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-024#28:1>
These in turn were eventually replaced during the Cretaceous by the
proto-angiosperms and then the angiosperms.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-024#29:1>
The angiosperms, from which the modern flowering plant forest
evolved, first appeared in substantial numbers in the fossil record in the
Cretaceous, which began about 135 million years ago and ended about 65
million years ago.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-024#30:1>
They probably originated in a tropical setting in western
Gondwanaland ( a grouping of southern land masses) and then migrated to what
are today South America, India and Australia ( Raven and Axelrod, 1974;
Ashton, 1977; Doyle, 1978; Flenley, 1979; Mabberley, 1983 ) .

<ICE-SIN:W2A-024#31:1>
The tropical rain forest has evolved from these beginnings, with
angiosperms dominating almost all the equatorial regions of the world.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-024#32:1>
Although the geographic distribution and extent of the forest would
have changed enormously as a result of continental drift, climatic and
sea-level fluctuations, and the flora and fauna undergone evolutionary
changes, Richards ( 1973) considered it likely that its general appearance
and characteristics today would not have been different from what they were
in the remote past.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-024#33:1>
The tropical rain forest is the richest and most complex ecosystem in
the world.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-024#34:1>
This species richness is the most distinctive characteristic of the
tropical rain forest, one which distinguishes it from the other ecological
communities of the earth.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-024#35:1>
There are no accurate figures of the number of species, but rough
estimates indicate that the tropics, covering only 6 per cent of the world's
land surface, has about 40 per cent of its total stock of species (
Lowe-McConnell, 1969; et al., 1973; Raven, 1976; Myers, 1979).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-024#36:1>
This amounts to several million species of plants and animals -
according to Jacobs ( 1978) between 2 and 4 million, and to Sohmer ( 1978)
about 3 million.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-024#37:1>
The US National Academy of estimates that only about one-sixth of the
probable species of plants and animals in the tropics have been collected,
identified and named ( Nat.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-024#38:1>
Res.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-024#39:1>
1980).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-024#40:1>
There are roughly three times as many known species of anim plants,
but the great majority of these are insects ( Golley, 1983).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-024#41:1>
Less than 1 cent of all the tropical rain forest species have been
assessed for their potential value to man ( Caufield, 1982).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-024#42:1>
This species richness and species diversity is a function of the
evolutionary history of the rain forest plants and animals.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-024#43:1>
The richest of the three major tropical regions of the world is
Southeast Asia which, according to Raven and Axelrod ( 1974) may be a
reflection of the survival of taxa which migrated in geographically remote
times to this relatively isolated, equable and diverse area.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-024#44:1>
Here, as in the other parts of the tropics, life forms of the plants
are dominated by trees, which, coupled with the abundance of lianes, herbs
and epiphytes, result in a rich and diversified flora.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-024#45:1>
The floristic richness can be gauged from Table 1.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-024#46:1>
Although the plant families in the tropical rain forest are numerous,
there are marked regional variations.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-024#47:1>
For example, the Dipterocarpaceae, which is the dominant family in
Southeast Asia, is not represented in the other major tropical regions.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-024#48:1>
Species representation of the tropical rain forest biome vary not
only from continent to continent, but also within continents and even over
small areas.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-024#49:1>
While the tropical rain forest of the Old World and the New World
share a similar structure and appearance, few plant and almost no animal
species are common to both.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-024#50:1>
In any equatorial area differences in topography, elevation and soils
may result in as many as 12 different types of rain forest ( Richards, 1952;
Whitemore, 1984).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-024#51:1>
Another area of difference arises from the wide variations in the
environmental combinations of soil and climate within the global range of
tropical mixed forest which appear to make it more sensitive to disruption in
the African and American tropics than in Southeast Asia ( Leslie, 1989).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-024#52:1>
In the tropical rain forest ecosystem the major producers are woody
plants, mainly trees.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-024#53:1>
Today trees with wood of the desired qualities are the main products,
although it was not so in the past ( see Dunn, 1975).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-024#54:1>
Trees of a great diversity of sizes and structures are the most
prominent members of the rain forest.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-024#55:1>
Of the 3,000 species of trees in the Malay Peninsula, about 800 reach
one metre in girth, that is, are of commercial size.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-024#56:1>
The number of trees of 10 cm and above diameter at breast height (
d.b.h.) in the lowland rain forest of the Peninsula has been enumerated at
489 per hectare.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-024#57:1>
The numbers in the other main tropical regions are: Latin America (
Guyana) 432; Africa ( Nigeria and Ivory Coast) <X>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-024#X58:1>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-024#59:1>
The extremely rich floristic composition of the forests of the Malay
Peninsula is seen in the fact that these 489 trees belong to 197 species, as
compared to 91 species for Guyana, 70 for Nigeria and 74 for the Ivory Coast
( Loyett-Smith, 1949).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-024#60:1>
As the forest can support only a limited number of mature
individuals, the big trees that form the upper stratum of the rain forest are
far less in number than the smaller ones: a count in the Peninsula shows that
the number of trees with a girth of 4 feet ( 1.22 m) ranges from 55 to 95 (
Ng, 1983).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-024#61:1>
In Poore's ( 1968) study of a 23 ha piece of lowland rain forest in
Jengka, Peninsular Malaysia, of the 377 upper canopy species, 143 species (
38%) were represented by a single mature individual, and 307 species ( 81%)
by 1 to 10 mature individuals each.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-024#62:1>
One important consequence of species diversity and richness in the
rain forest is that most species, including those trees that are commercially
valuable, are widely scattered and have a very low population density.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-024#63:1>
As Jacobs ( 1988) has graphically illustrated, in a rain forest where
only 4-10 per cent of all tree species are commercially valuable, the chance
of a harvested tree being replaced by another is also about 4-10 per cent.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-024#64:1>
The removal of even a few members of a small population will have a
large impact in percentage terms: thus in a 3-hectare area where there are
only 12 trees of Dyera costulata, logging two of these would reduce the per
hectare population by 50 per cent.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-024#65:1>
Furthermore, it takes a long period of time to rebuild viable
populations of individual species.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-024#66:1>
As Ng ( 1983) has put it 'In tropical rain forests far more species
are uncommon than common hence the conservation of such forests is
inseparable from the conservation of uncommon species'.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-024#67:1>
In the self-sustaining rain forest the ecosystem the main producers
are and other woody plants, including thick-stemmed woody creepers, and
lianes or vines.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-024#68:1>
These climbers grow to the canopy top and often have large crowns.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-024#69:1>
One hectare of the Malaysian mixed dipterocarp forest would have as
many as 376 climbers with stem diameters greater than 2 cm belonging to 25
species ( Appanah and Putz, 1983).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-024#70:1>
Among the woody vines are those belonging to the sub-family
Lepidocaryoidaceae, the members of which are known in South-east Asia as
rattans.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-024#71:1>
Several hundred species of rattans have been identified, with
diameters ranging from less than one cm to over 20 cm ( Dransfield,1979).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-024#72:1>
Rattans have for long been an important product of the region's rain
forest, to the extent that prompted Corner ( 1966) to describe the
civilisation of South East Asia as 'the rattan civilization'.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-024#73:1>
Apart from the smaller trees and climbers, the undergrowth of the
tropical rain forest is made up of a wide assortment of herbaceous plants,
including parasitic plants as well as the non-parasitic epiphytes ( plants
that attached themselves to the trunks and branches of trees).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-024#74:1>
Mosses, fungi, algae and lichens are also common.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-024#75:1>
These plants are a source of a wide range of products, including
gums, resins, medicinal plants, and food and fibres.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-024#76:1>
The species richness of the plants of the tropical rain forest is
repeated in the fauna, and within the forest canopy is a wide range of
animals, some herbivorous, others carnivorous.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-024#77:1>
The plants and animals have complex inter-relationships exhibited,
for example, in flower pollination and fruit dispersal ( see Whitmore, 1984).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-024#78:1>
Studies conducted of the animal groups in the tropical rain forest
have shown that the number of species is large compared with those of other
ecosystems.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-024#79:1>
The Malay Peninsula, for example, has 199 known species of mammals
belonging to 32 families ( Medway, 1969).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-024#80:1>
In a 52 km area of lowland rain forest in Sarawak 135 species of
reptiles and amphibia were identified in the course of one year, a number
more than three times that of a forest area in Mississippi ( Lloyd, et al,
1968). <X>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-024#X81:1>
The avifauna is also extremely rich: a 777 km ( 300 sq ml) of rain
forest in Costa Rica and Panama had 500 to 600 resident species of birds,
more than four times as many as are found in the broad-leaved forests of
eastern North America ( Richards, 1973).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-024#X82:1>
The Malesian rain forest is just as rich, with some 70 per cent of
the 800 bird species known to occur in Sundaland being forest species (
Whitmore, 1984).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-024#X83:1>
Five hundred species of insects have been captured in 2,000 sweeps
of a net in a Central American forest ( Richards, 1973). </X> </I>
