<h> INTRODUCTION </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-032#17:1>
Growing vegetables in one's own garden is a common hobby for many
households in the west.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-032#18:1>
Can we in Singapore indulge in such a hobby.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-032#19:1>
The answer is yes!

<ICE-SIN:W2B-032#20:1>
You may find it more expensive than direct purchase from the market,
but there is some pride and joy in cultivating vegetables and harvest the
fruits of your labour.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-032#21:1>
You need not require a large vegetable plot of land.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-032#22:1>
It can be lm by 5m plot or any dimensions.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-032#23:1>
For those living in compound household a small piece of land is no
problem.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-032#24:1>
Even in condominiums and HDB apartments, growing of some leafy
vegetables may be possible at the balcony in proper troughs.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-032#25:1>
There must be 4 to 5 hours of sunlight exposure, either to the
morning or afternoon sun.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-032#26:1>
If you are hesitant to invest on a proper cement trough, with
drainage hole, the cheapest way would to buy a few plastic bathtubs.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-032#27:1>
<h> LADY'S FINGER </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-032#28:1>
The seed colour varies from dark green white to brown and black.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-032#29:1>
The sowing process involves digging a small hole ( about 3 cm) and
place the seed into it and covered up with soil.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-032#30:1>
The holes should be sown about lm apart, since it is a woody shrub,
about 2m tall when matured.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-032#31:1>
At each growing point, it is advisable to have two sowing positions
close to each other, so that hopefully at least one seed will germinate.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-032#32:1>
Should both germinate then one of them, usually the weaker one is
being removed.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-032#33:1>
The seeds will germinate about 5 days from sowing, and watered at
least twice a day.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-032#34:1>
The new seedlings will appear weak and if sunlight is too strong,
provide some overhead shade.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-032#35:1>
It takes about a month for it to mature to a sturdy plant.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-032#36:1>
The stem is slightly hairy.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-032#37:1>
Soluble fertilizer is used , since it is easily absorbed by the leaf,
root and other parts of the plant.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-032#38:1>
If granular fertilizer is used, do not apply it too near the stem, as
otherwise it may burn the bark and cause rotting.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-032#39:1>
The leaf is large, alternate and cordate.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-032#40:1>
The flower is attractive sulphur-yellow having a dark purple or
maroon eye in the center.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-032#41:1>
Naturally when flower blossomed, ants and insects will crawl all
over.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-032#42:1>
After the petals fall off tiny bud appear.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-032#43:1>
The bud will grow into a full grown lady's finger in about 6 days
time.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-032#44:1>
Do not delay the harvest as the fruit will turn fibrous and become
less palatable.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-032#45:1>
If harvesting is late, the fruit is hardened when checked by a gentle
squeeze by hand or fingers.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-032#46:1>
Allow it to grow to maturity and let the fruit to dry naturally by
itself to brown colour.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-032#47:1>
The matured seeds can be harvested from the pods for future sowing.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-032#48:1>
Keep the seeds in a cool dry place.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-032#49:1>
Inspect the leaves for any fungi growth or other infection eg POWDERY
MILDEWS, because they impart a white powdery appearance on infected plant
parts.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-032#50:1>
Then spray it with TRITOGOL-MZ FUNGICIDE or other appropriate
pesticide.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-032#51:1>
Make sure you can identify the correct pesticide for the problem.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-032#52:1>
If not, refer to some reference books or pesticide particulars from
the bottles or labels.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-032#53:1>
Try not to use too much pesticides, after all the objective of home
gardening is to have pesticide free vegetables.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-032#54:1>
Try not to harvest until four/five days after spraying pesticide.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-032#55:1>
The lady's finger plant will continue to bear fruit for about 2
months, during which period each plant produce about 35 to 40 fruits.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-032#56:1>
The fruit is a pointed and more or less cylindrical ( lOcm-15cm long)
with five ridged capsule.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-032#57:1>
Lady's finger is a delight for various cooking methods, for example;
a) fish head curry.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-032#58:1>
b) steam it in a rice cooker just before the rice hardens.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-032#59:1>
c) cut it to thin slice and fry it in oil with a bit of salt.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-032#60:1>
You can taste the natural sweetness and freshness from the the fruits
of your own labour, literally.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-032#61:1>
<h> KANGKONG </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-032#62:1>
It appears that there are mainly two varieties of kangkong are
cultivated.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-032#63:1>
The aquatic form planted in the rice fields, provides a succulent
leaf vegetable called the " WATER KANGKONG".

<ICE-SIN:W2B-032#64:1>
The other variety is the dryland form, known as " KANGKONG PUTEH".

<ICE-SIN:W2B-032#65:1>
It is grown from seeds as are other vegetables, except it requires
plenty of water.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-032#66:1>
The leaves are long and slender and plants can be planted in a high
density.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-032#67:1>
It is rich in iron content, and often fed to patients who are anemic.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-032#68:1>
<h> CABBAGE </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-032#69:1>
It produces a large, more or less dense " head" of leaves from a
condense stem.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-032#70:1>
Cabbages are harvested after the " head" has been formed.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-032#71:1>
When the head begin to turn white colour from green, indicates the
time to harvest.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-032#72:1>
The outer leaves' protecting the head or in contact with the soil,
will drop off first.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-032#73:1>
Caterpillars nest between the large leaves, and is their favourite
place.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-032#74:1>
Also, stagnant water or rain will be trapped between the leaves and
tend to breed mosquitoes.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-032#75:1>
Spend more time catching caterpillars, as they can camouflaged
themselves quite well.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-032#76:1>
Leaves are eaten cooked or raw in salads.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-032#77:1>
<h> CHYE SIM </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-032#78:1>
( Scientific name Brassica rapa L )

<ICE-SIN:W2B-032#79:1>
The seeds are tiny dark brown to black in colour.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-032#80:1>
The seeds are buried about 2 cm below the soil.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-032#81:1>
Seeds can be sown in a relatively high density pattern.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-032#82:1>
The seeds will take about a week to germinate.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-032#83:1>
The seedlings can then be transplanted evenly over the planting bed
to ensure proper distribution.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-032#84:1>
All plants should be harvested within 8 to 9 weeks from sowing,
otherwise their stalks will become too fibrous for cooking.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-032#85:1>
The plants should be watered at least twice a day, with occasional
liquid or solid fertilizer used.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-032#86:1>
The frequency of fertilizer used will depend on trial and error, but
too much fertilizers would kill the plant.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-032#87:1>
Should an infestation of caterpillars occur, either completely
harvest the crop and replant with another type of vegetable, or spray the
crop with the recommended pesticide.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-032#88:1>
Since a garden plot is normally a small area, pesticide may not be
necessary, but you have to spend time catching caterpillars.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-032#89:1>
The numerous caterpillars of moths, feed on leaf tissues, producing
translucent patches.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-032#90:1>
Chye Sim are excellent for making soups and frying with other
ingredients, for various dishes.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-032#91:1>
It is relatively a fast crop, compared by KAI LAN and cabbages.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-032#92:1>
<h> KAI LAN </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-032#93:1>
The leaves are thick bluish-green and oval in shape.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-032#94:1>
It is cut for the market from the young plants or before the first
flower buds begin to open.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-032#95:1>
KAI LAN takes a longer time to grow, hence it is more expensive than
CHYE SIM.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-032#96:1>
<h> WASHING VEGETABLES HOW TO WASH THE VEGETABLES </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-032#97:1>
Wash vegetables thoroughly to remove soil particles and
micro-organisms that are in the soil.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-032#98:1>
Pesticide residues can also be removed by a thorough rinsing of the
vegetables under a tap for at least a minute.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-032#99:1>
Washing can be done in a basin of clean water.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-032#100:1>
If so, you ought to change water several times.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-032#101:1>
During each change of water, lift up the vegetables before draining
off the waste water to avoid recontamination.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-032#102:1>
<h> FERTILIZERS </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-032#103:1>
There are many types of fertilizers available.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-032#104:1>
a) solid or granulated.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-032#105:1>
b) water soluble.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-032#106:1>
Water soluble types can be:-

<ICE-SIN:W2B-032#107:1>
<h> THRIVE </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-032#108:1>
<h> Directions. </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-032#109:1>
Dissolve one spoonful in 4.5 litre of water ( two to an average
watering can) and apply fortnightly.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-032#110:1>
4.5 litres of mixture is sufficient for an average sized shrub ( one
metre) for a dozen annual plants, six boxes of seedlings, or an area of
approximate 4 m square.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-032#111:1>
<h> VEGETABLES </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-032#112:1>
Thrive is good for all leafy vegetables, lettuces, spinach, silver
beat, etc, give weekly applications for fast growth.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-032#113:1>
For crop bearing vegetables apply immediately after flowers appear.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-032#114:1>
<h> FLOWERS </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-032#115:1>
Give all your flowers a flying start, apply Thrive soluble plant
food as soon as buds begin to show.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-032#116:1>
You will be rewarded with strong blooms.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-032#117:1>
<h> SEEDLINGS. </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-032#118:1>
Apply Thrive solution monthly, in warm water ( first ensure the soil
is damp).

<ICE-SIN:W2B-032#119:1>
Helps keep them healthy and shiny.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-032#120:1>
Half strength for delicate ferns.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-032#121:1>
<h> SHRUBS. </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-032#122:1>
4.5 litres of thrive solution is the average for a shrub about 1m
high.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-032#123:1>
You will find growth is good and blossoms last well using Thrive
regularly.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-032#124:1>
<h> HORTI-SOIL </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-032#125:1>
Horti-soil is a natural product of humus which is made on the
maturation by intense bacterial action of a mixture of organic matter, peat
moss, medium loam and supplemented with inorganic superphosphate, muriate of
potash, limestone, essential trace elements and a fungicide.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-032#126:1>
Horti-soil will improve soil structure, has high water holding
capacity and will supply adequate nutrients.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-032#127:1>
Auxins for promoting plant growth resulting in healthy and disease
free plants.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-032#128:1>
When preparing the RED soil for the bed, it is best to mix it
throughly with horti-soil or other commercially produced compost.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-032#129:1>
<h> PESTICIDES </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-032#130:1>
There are many types of pesticides available in the market.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-032#131:1>
It is a question of identifying the correct one for the particular
disease.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-032#132:1>
You may have to read some reference books or get some tips from the
nurseries.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-032#133:1>
<h> EXAMPLES: </h> <h> TRITOGOL-MZ FUNGICIDE </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-032#134:1>
Tritogol-MZ fungicide is a new formulated carbamate compound foliar
fungicide.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-032#135:1>
It is very effective in controlling a wide range of diseases on
vegetables, fruits trees, flowers, field crops, turf grass, ornamentals and
shrubs.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-032#136:1>
It's stable and provides long protective period.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-032#137:1>
It has low toxity and will not damage plants.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-032#138:1>
RATE OF APPLICATION:- in general use 1 tablespoon to 4.5 litres of
water.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-032#139:1>
<h> CAPTAN 50% W.P. </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-032#140:1>
It is a chlorinated hydrocarbon specially formulated to combat
fungus diseases of fruits, vegetables, ornamentals and estate crops.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-032#141:1>
It is extremely effective.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-032#142:1>
It is also used as a preplanting soil treatment against soil borne
diseases.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-032#143:1>
Captan is compatible and can be readily used with most fungicides
and insecticides.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-032#144:1>
<h> DIRECTIONS FOR USE. </h>

period.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-032#156:1>
<h> APPENDIX </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-032#157:1>
<h> THE CHANGING FACE OF AGRICULTURE </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-032#158:1>
FROM:- Twenty five years ago, about a quarter of Singapore's total
land area was made up of farmland.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-032#159:1>
There were more than 20,000 farmers producing vegetables, food
crops, pigs and poultry, on small plots of land, averaging half a hectare
each.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-032#160:1>
Manual labour was used intensively in the various stages of farming,
such as land preparation, sowing, transplanting, watering and weeding.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-032#161:1>
TO:

<ICE-SIN:W2B-032#162:1>
Today, only two per cent of the land area is cultivated by fewer
than a thousand licensed farmers.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-032#163:1>
Using modern farming methods to save labour, machines are used in
land preparation and sprinklers for watering crops.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-032#164:1>
In a greenhouse, such as the one shown below, well over 100 tonnes
of vegetables can be harvested from one hectare of farmland, compared with 70
tonnes from the same plot in a traditional farm. </I>

<I>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-032#165:2>
<h> Bang & Olufsen BeoLab 8000 </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-032#166:2>
These are about the coolest speakers you can actually find space for
in your living room.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-032#167:2>
With a small footprint, this 1.32m tall B&O speaker has placed the
power amplifiers, one for treble and one for bass, into the loudspeakers
themselves to reduce cabinet volume and improve performance.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-032#168:2>
It's what they call the " active Loudspeakers" principle, where the
loudspeaker can play at a higher volume without distortion or damage to the
drive unit while eliminating all the sonic problems that wooden cabinets
traditionally battle with. <X>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-032#X169:2>
Not that I care though, because these speakers are the coolest
giant-shiny-aluminium-ball-point-pen look-a-like speakers that I have seen.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-032#X170:2>
Now that I think of it, they are the only ones around! </X> </I>
