<h> A Drop of Blood </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2F-003#2:1>
IT WAS almost ten in the morning and Raymond Wong was already locked
up in his cramped two room Housing Development Board ( HDB) flat, revising a
Shakespearean play 'Macbeth' for the afternoon literature paper.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-003#3:1>
Already, he was cramming as much as his tired mind could absorb
despite the Cantonese soap opera from the next door's Rediffusion box
blasting against Macbeth's attempt on Duncan's life in Act Two, Scene Two.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-003#4:1>
Frustrated, he closed the book and threw it against the wall.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-003#5:1>
" Inconsiderate pigs!" he muttered, turning around and staring at the
book lying on the floor.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-003#6:1>
For many times, he had wondered why he had allowed himself to apply
for annual leave and be tormented under the immense pressure of the General
Certificate Examination ( GCE) 'A' level exams.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-003#7:1>
He hated studying.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-003#8:1>
But as his superior officer once said to him, " Wong, if you are to
climb the ladder it would be better to have a 'A' level cert.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-003#9:1>
Otherwise, you might remain as a detective for the rest of your career
in the force.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-003#10:1>
Paper qualification is important in Singapore."

<ICE-SIN:W2F-003#11:1>
Yes, a paper qualification would help ...a lot.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-003#12:1>
Reluctantly, he bent down trying to reach for the book, when the door
bell chimed.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-003#13:1>
Standing up, he pulled his crumbled loose pyjamas pants higher and
opened the door.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-003#14:1>
A five year old Malay boy, Ismail bin Mohammad, was standing there
with his arms behind his back.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-003#15:1>
" Yah, Ismail?" The timid Malay boy quickly revealed his right arm,
clutching a letter.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-003#16:1>
" Encik, aunty ask me to give you this.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-003#17:1>
Postman just came."

<ICE-SIN:W2F-003#18:1>
" Okay, where's aunty?"

<ICE-SIN:W2F-003#19:1>
" Market, buy food."

<ICE-SIN:W2F-003#20:1>
With that, he dashed along the corridor and down the stairs.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-003#21:1>
Raymond closed the door, remarking to himself that he was never good
with children.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-003#22:1>
Somehow, they always feared him.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-003#23:1>
Maybe, because he was a Mata-Mata ( Policeman).

<ICE-SIN:W2F-003#24:1>
On the way to the bedroom, he tore open the brown envelope.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-003#25:1>
On the face was his scrawny written address:

<ICE-SIN:W2F-003#26:1>
Raymond Wong

<ICE-SIN:W2F-003#27:1>
Blk 701, 134V

<ICE-SIN:W2F-003#28:1>
Singapore 0316

<ICE-SIN:W2F-003#29:1>
Slumped onto his favourite Malacca cane chair, he pulled out the
sheet of paper.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-003#30:1>
Only a drop of blood, or so it seemed, was easy to notice.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-003#31:1>
It was the size of a five cents coin, and was placed or dipped
prominently in the centre.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-003#32:1>
But it did not interest Raymond Wong.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-003#33:1>
Thinking that it was one of those pranks played by the neighbourhood
children, he tore it up.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-003#34:1>
After all, children never liked him.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-003#35:1>
That night, his wife brought up a letter.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-003#36:1>
It was a similar brown letter with the scrawny written address.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-003#37:1>
In it, the content was similar too, if not, the same.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-003#38:1>
A drop of blood.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-003#39:1>
Raymond pondered over the matter and began to wonder about the person
who was so willing to spare his blood over a plain wordless sheet of paper.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-003#40:1>
A practical joker?

<ICE-SIN:W2F-003#41:1>
Or one of his colleagues who was trying to humour him with 'study
with blood and sweat'?

<ICE-SIN:W2F-003#42:1>
Could this be a woman?

<ICE-SIN:W2F-003#43:1>
Or an ex-criminal seeking revenge?

<ICE-SIN:W2F-003#44:1>
Not wanting to worry, he quickly stuffed the letter into his trousers
pocket.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-003#45:1>
Nonchalantly, he returned to his chair and started reading his
history book.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-003#46:1>
He tried to study but his mind halted every time and he thought to
submit himself into thinking of the letter.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-003#47:1>
He knew he would do badly for the history paper.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-003#48:1>
Immediately after taking the history paper, which he did not do well
at all, Raymond, a now worried man, went back to his office.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-003#49:1>
Firstly, he was worried about the possible threat against him or his
lone treasure, his wife.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-003#50:1>
Secondly, he wondered what the response from his colleagues would be.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-003#51:1>
Hopefully, they would not laugh at him: a fully trained detective
frightened by a possible childish prank.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-003#52:1>
No one laughed.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-003#53:1>
On the contrary, much interest was expressed in the alleged threat,
especially on the letter which Raymond had brought along.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-003#54:1>
The Officer in Charge of the Detective Office, Inspector Tan,
remarked that the letter was probably sent by someone who had a grudge
against Raymond.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-003#55:1>
" Me?" asked Raymond incredulously.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-003#56:1>
He had every right to be.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-003#57:1>
For the past few years, he had been handling only minor cases ranging
from shoplifting to stolen vehicles.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-003#58:1>
Nothing of that would warrant a threat.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-003#59:1>
" I'II tell you what, Ray.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-003#60:1>
First, I can send this to our lab for analysis and I will inform the
station to intensify patrol around your area.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-003#61:1>
Other than that, there is nothing more we can do for the moment,"
Inspector Tan said.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-003#62:1>
" And stay at home more often, huh.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-003#63:1>
We know what to do.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-003#64:1>
And you know our regular advice: see anything suspicious, call us,
all right?" his colleagues assured him.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-003#65:1>
Feeling comforted, Raymond went home.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-003#66:1>
At least his friends were doing something.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-003#67:1>
Now, all he had to do was to wait for the laboratory test result and
stay at home more often.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-003#68:1>
It was true that he had not handled a major case since two years ago.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-003#69:1>
Driving on his way back he was unconsciously thinking of the letter.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-003#70:1>
The more he dwelled on the subject, the more logic could initiate
that it was nothing more than a harmless prank.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-003#71:1>
Stop worrying, he told himself.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-003#72:1>
Putting on a forced smile and whistling an off beat tune, he tried to
concentrate on the driving instead.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-003#73:1>
He reached home just as the telephone rang.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-003#74:1>
Opening the door, he was surprised to find nobody at home.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-003#75:1>
Yet he shouted, " Mei!

<ICE-SIN:W2F-003#76:1>
Telephone!" No answer.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-003#77:1>
When the phone shrilled for the third time, Ray snatched the hand
piece and muttered a curse.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-003#78:1>
" Yah!" " Raymond?

<ICE-SIN:W2F-003#79:1>
This is Tan, we just got the lab result." It was his
Officer-in-Charge.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-003#80:1>
" So fast?"

<ICE-SIN:W2F-003#81:1>
" Yes, we gave you priority.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-003#82:1>
Lab result could not reveal any finger prints ...

<ICE-SIN:W2F-003#83:1>
But here is the good news.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-003#84:1>
That blood on the paper consists nothing but water colour paint."
Raymond broke into relief laughter.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-003#85:1>
" Nice to hear that, huh?

<ICE-SIN:W2F-003#86:1>
Anyway, it seems to he a harmless threat so I am putting this matter
on KIV ( keep in view), but you will still have extra patrols around your
area.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-003#87:1>
Very Important Person treatment, you know," Inspector Tan laughed.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-003#88:1>
" Hey, thanks.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-003#89:1>
Sure appreciate it!" From that moment on, Raymond felt reassured.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-003#90:1>
A little child's prank?

<ICE-SIN:W2F-003#91:1>
He broke into laughter again.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-003#92:1>
Putting his thoughts away, he resumed studying.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-003#93:1>
Only this time, he did so with full concentration power.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-003#94:1>
This time he was going to score in his Ceneral Paper and Economics.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-003#95:1>
A wave of confidence swept through him.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-003#96:1>
Several days passed and Raymond had made it a point to look into the
post box regularly.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-003#97:1>
They were only bills and the usual junk mail.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-003#98:1>
Nothing else.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-003#99:1>
His fear, by this time, had almost disappeared, so much so, that he
informed his station, the Queenstown Police Station, also known as 'D'
Division, to close the case.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-003#100:1>
But still, he did notice that there were more foot patrols around
his block of flats.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-003#101:1>
And when he looked into the opposite block, he was shocked to see a
person standing at the corridor of the same level, staring into his dining
hall.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-003#102:1>
A wave of cold chill shot up.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-003#103:1>
Raymond observed clearly and, after quite some time, to his relief,
discovered that the man was his colleague, a plain clothes detective.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-003#104:1>
Real kind of inspector, Raymond thought, and mental note to thank
him personally for the assistance.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-003#105:1>
The sight of the plain clothes policeman brought Raymond some peace
and a feeling of foolishness.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-003#106:1>
No doubt, he had never felt safer in his own home but yet he was
embarrassed to have troubled his friends.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-003#107:1>
Several times a day, he would look into the opposite flat to confirm
the detective 's presence.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-003#108:1>
He was still there.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-003#109:1>
It was coming to the end of the examination period and Raymond felt
relaxed.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-003#110:1>
His last paper was Chinese Language and there was nothing much to
study for.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-003#111:1>
Settled onto his favourite chair he started reading the newspaper.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-003#112:1>
It was Tuesday and it had been quite some time since he had a chance
to read the morning paper peacefully now that the letter incident was dying
off, and his wife out for facial treatment.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-003#113:1>
Surprisingly, there was no noise from his neighbours, no kids
screaming along the corridor and, of course, no prank letters.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-003#114:1>
Only the passing of the morning traffic provided the disturbance he
had been used to.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-003#115:1>
As he read the paper, he was contemplating on how he should spend
his last two days of his leave.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-003#116:1>
Movies?

<ICE-SIN:W2F-003#117:1>
Fishing orjust plain sleeping?

<ICE-SIN:W2F-003#118:1>
He was really enjoying the thoughts when the door bell chimed.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-003#119:1>
His wife?

<ICE-SIN:W2F-003#120:1>
He stood up, stretched himself and strode to the door.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-003#121:1>
Expecting to see his wife or neighbour, he was surprised to see a
tall Indian man dressed in light green shirt and dark green trousers.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-003#122:1>
The postman.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-003#123:1>
" Yes?'

<ICE-SIN:W2F-003#124:1>
" Hello, I have a registered letter for Mr Raymond Wong.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-003#125:1>
You Raymond Wong?" His breath, filled with cigar smell, forced
Raymond to totter a few steps backward.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-003#126:1>
" Yes, yes, yes.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-003#127:1>
Let me sign the paper." His hand quickly snatched the counterfoil
and he signed it.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-003#128:1>
Unlike the usual green slip, this copy was in light brown.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-003#129:1>
Ray commented on it and the postman quickly replied that this was
the new set of counterfoil.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-003#130:1>
" Here you are."

<ICE-SIN:W2F-003#131:1>
" Thanks, by the way, could I use your toilet?"

<ICE-SIN:W2F-003#132:1>
Raymond smiled and with his warm hospitality directed him to the
toilet.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-003#133:1>
While waiting for the postman, Raymond looked at the letters that
the postman had brought up for him as well.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-003#134:1>
Well, there were the usual Reader's Digest bill, Public Utilities
Board bill, the registered letter from the Inland Revenue Department, then
something struck him.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-003#135:1>
It was the letter from Reader's Digest.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-003#136:1>
There was a ten-cent stamp on it but it was not stamped by the post
office.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-003#137:1>
Even the registered letter had his name and address on a label
unlike the normal procedure which was on the envelope.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-003#138:1>
Not really knowing what to do, he tore open the envelope.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-003#139:1>
And there it was: a sheet of white paper.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-003#140:1>
And a drop of blood.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-003#141:1>
" It is going to be your blood." The voice startled him as Raymond
turned around.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-003#142:1>
He gave a soft scream when he saw a gleaming kitchen knife and fell
back onto the sofa.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-003#143:1>
The sudden chill pierced sharply into his abdomen as he uttered.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-003#144:1>
" Who are you!" The Indian smiled, revealing his thick wet lips.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-003#145:1>
It was a smile that announced death.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-003#146:1>
" You don't know me.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-003#147:1>
Think, Wong, six years ago.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-003#148:1>
The Redhill Murder?" Ray's mind raced back six years ago.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-003#149:1>
One late evening a young 18-year old girl was found molested and
murdered in a slightly deserted car park.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-003#150:1>
A dagger was found stabbed into her stomach.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-003#151:1>
Ten minutes earlier, a robbery was committed near this vicinity.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-003#152:1>
This time, there were witnesses.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-003#153:1>
The victim, an old man, identified the Indian during the
identification.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-003#154:1>
The other witness confirmed the identification.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-003#155:1>
The investigating officer, Detective Raymond Wong, immediately put
him under arrest.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-003#156:1>
A week later, another charge of molesting and murder was served on
him.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-003#157:1>
" Do you recall now?

<ICE-SIN:W2F-003#158:1>
I was sentenced to six years imprisonment and not the death sentence
because you could not put up a credible case.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-003#159:1>
Yes, I did commit the robbery.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-003#160:1>
But I never did kill that girl.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-003#161:1>
You wanted results, fast results and never bothered the life of an
innocent man.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-003#162:1>
You tried to kill me!"

<ICE-SIN:W2F-003#163:1>
" No, no, listen, please.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-003#164:1>
Yes, it was my fault.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-003#165:1>
I sort of got carried away, you know, the promotion and so on.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-003#166:1>
I made a dumb mistake.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-003#167:1>
Please forgive me, I have a wife and maybe a child soon." Raymond
pleaded, tears rolling down to his cheek.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-003#168:1>
" Forgive?

<ICE-SIN:W2F-003#169:1>
Never!" Raymond felt a sharp pain in his abdomen and collapsed.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-003#170:1>
When the police discovered him, slumped on the floor, he was already
dead.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-003#171:1>
His right hand was still clutching the letter.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-003#172:1>
They couldn't find any weapons for clues.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-003#173:1>
The plain clothes detective did not notice anyone suspicious.
