<ICE-SIN:W1A-002#1:1>
Question: What significant features did a) the can vuong movement b)
turn of the century rural rebellions in North and Northeast Siam c) the Hsaya
San rebellion have in common?

<ICE-SIN:W1A-002#2:1>
What major differences were there in the three cases?

<ICE-SIN:W1A-002#3:1>
Answer: Colonial or colonial-like policies in the 3 three states in
question had good and bad consequences.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-002#4:1>
Depending on how it is viewed, one manifestation of the above was the
presence of resistance movements.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-002#5:1>
The ma can vuong movement, the rural rebellions in North and
North-east Thailand and the Saya San Rebellion though occurring existing at
different times had more or less similar goals and in a way used similar
methods to appeal to the people.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-002#6:1>
Moreover, their appeal was mainly towards those who were oppressed -
the peasants.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-002#7:1>
The three resistance movements aspired to replace the ruling body.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-002#8:1>
The can-vuong movement intended to get rid of the French colonialists.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-002#9:1>
They were also unhappy with the seemingly complacent royal rulers and
the Mandarin collaborators.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-002#10:1>
They saw these collaborators as betraying their own people.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-002#11:1>
They wrote scathing messages to these.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-002#12:1>
For example, Phan Dinh Phung wrote, " You must realise that wherever
the French go, there flock around them groups of petty men who offer plans
and tricks to gain the enemy's confidence...

<ICE-SIN:W1A-002#13:1>
They use every expedient to squeeze the people out of their
possessions." ( Marr, 1971, pg 67).

<ICE-SIN:W1A-002#14:1>
They also saw the emperor as a p puppet ruler, controlled by the
French.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-002#15:1>
Thus, they wanted to get rid of the French, so that the emperor could
rule once again.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-002#16:1>
The Thai rebellions regarded the ruling body as enemies.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-002#17:1>
They intended to " negate the state", and live independently of the
government.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-002#18:1>
However, the Chiangmai rebellion ( 1899-1900) was more radical in
that it intended to set up a government ( Tanabe, 1984, pg 98) while the "
Holy Men" Rebellion in 1901 were less so, intending to make the village the
centre of their new society.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-002#19:1>
( Tanabe, pg 124).

<ICE-SIN:W1A-002#20:1>
This seemed natural as the latter of the two took place in the most
backward part of Thailand.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-002#21:1>
( Tanabe, pg 129).

<ICE-SIN:W1A-002#22:1>
The Saya San Rebellion intended to " restore Burmese rule revive
Buddhism, and re-establish the traditional order of things in Burma." ( Adas,
1974, pg 200.) He planned to do this by getting rid of the British and
restoring the monarchy.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-002#23:1>
Another common feature was their appeal to the peasants, and their
methods used.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-002#24:1>
The can vuong movement involved mainly the peasants, who were led by
the scholar gentry leaders.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-002#25:1>
This was because the peasants' lot was very bad.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-002#26:1>
They were badly exploited by the French.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-002#27:1>
Moreover, the can vuong movement appealed to the people because it
used symbols familiar to the people.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-002#28:1>
The movement captured the emperor and was used as a symbol of unity.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-002#29:1>
( Marr, 1971, pg 51.) With Confucian influence, the people highly
regarded the emperor and seeing the emperor fleeing to the mountains, were
moved to fight the French.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-002#30:1>
These sentiments were exacerbated by the Can Vuong Edict.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-002#31:1>
The movement also used reference to previous experiences against
against foreign presence ( China and Mongolia) and also brought up popular
figures of the past like Ku Yuan and Chao Tsui who righteously stood up for
what was right.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-002#32:1>
( Marr, 1971 pg 50.) The millenarian movements of Thailand appealed
to the peasants too.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-002#33:1>
The economic conditions were deteriorating especially with the
increase in central control by the government.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-002#34:1>
They resented this greater increase in control especially as their
ethnic background was Lao.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-002#35:1>
Their historical background of being " conquered people" made them
regard the government reforms as interfering in their lives.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-002#36:1>
Personalities like Ong Man and Phaya Phap were familiar symbols,
garnering support among the people.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-002#37:1>
They were regarded as " phu mi bun" or " men of great merit.", who
had supernatural powers to fight against bullets and other weapons.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-002#38:1>
They were believed to usher in a period of peace and prosperity.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-002#39:1>
Their use of chants, amulets, holy water and other rituals appealed
to the peasants, who were familiar with these.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-002#40:1>
Similarly, in Burma, the Saya San Rebellion appealed mainly to the
peasant classes.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-002#41:1>
The economic condition in Burma was also quite depressing especially
during the late 1920s and the 1930s.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-002#42:1>
The rice economy was subject to much fluctuations of the
international prices and when they dipped in 1930s, the peasants suffered
considerably.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-002#43:1>
The tenant farmers could not pay the rent and those who borrowed
money could not return it.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-002#44:1>
Moreover, jobs were not readily available and with the presence of
Indian immigrants.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-002#45:1>
Amidst all this, Saya San and his Galon Association arose, with his
royal regalia and golden galon symbols.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-002#46:1>
These greatly stirred the people because they believed in the coming
of a period of great peace & stability brought by a figure of royalty.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-002#47:1>
As a result, Saya San gained a large following.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-002#48:1>
Moving on now to differences in the various movements, One areas was
leadership.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-002#49:1>
Both the rural rebellions in Thailand and Burma were regarded as
millenarian movements of sorts, having strong links at least to the religious
and historical traditions of the past.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-002#50:1>
Their leader-ship was concentrated in religious figures of great
power and dynamism.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-002#51:1>
However, even here, Saya San could be seen as a more politicised
figure than most historians credit him for.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-002#52:1>
Patricia Herbert claims that due to his involvement with the Young
Men's Buddhist Association ( YMBA) and the General Council of Buddhist
Associations ( GCBA), he was already exposed to political methods and goings
on.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-002#53:1>
( Herbert, 1982, pg 11) He also realised that was not just another
traditional leader then.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-002#54:1>
The leadership of the can vuong movement was in the hands of the
scholar-gentry class.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-002#55:1>
It seemed natural that they were the leaders of the movement as they
were more in touch with the agrarian lifestyle than any other segments of
society.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-002#56:1>
They travelled much more than other classes of society and were "
closely rooted to the soil".

<ICE-SIN:W1A-002#57:1>
They thus could mix well with the peasants.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-002#58:1>
( Marr, 1971, pg 52-3).

<ICE-SIN:W1A-002#59:1>
Unlike the other two movements, the can vuong movement was seen to
use poetry as an influential mode to reach out to the people.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-002#60:1>
They did not use much tangible symbols or rituals.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-002#61:1>
Due to their scholar gentry class background, they were used to
writing poetry and were adept at it.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-002#62:1>
This was of great influence in stirring the people's emotions against
the French.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-002#63:1>
( Marr, 1971 pg 76) In fact, the movement is known as to have had
considerable sway over nationalists like Ho Chi Minh.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-002#64:1>
The can vuong movement was marked by its belief in " If we fail, hope
shifts to our sons." ( Marr, 1971, pg 44.) This is what gave the scholar
gentries the added impetus to fight against the French.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-002#65:1>
They believed that ultimately their cause would be fulfilled.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-002#66:1>
Hence, they were able to courageously stand against French naval
artillery, which was far more superior to theirs.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-002#67:1>
This was different from the others, as the participants in those
believed in the power and invulnerability of the amulets used.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-002#68:1>
One final point to note about the Saya San Rebellions in Burma
concerns the outbreak of ethnic clashes between the Burmese and the Chinese
and the Burma and the Indians.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-002#69:1>
Though in Thailand, acrimonious relations existed between the Thais
and the Chinese, they never reached as violent proportions as in Burma.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-002#70:1>
At the end of the rebellion, about 120 Indians were killed and 900
were wounded.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-002#71:1>
The clashes were thus very violent, stemming from already mentioned
causes.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-002#72:1>
In conclusion, I would like to say that each movement had their own
particular significance to the community in question.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-002#73:1>
Where colonial powers were present, the nationalists of that time or
later looked upon these movements lessons to learn from or as sources of
inspiration.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-002#74:1>
The monks involved in the Saya San Rebellion were later more and
involved in politics too.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-002#75:1>
As for the Thai rebellion, it signalled a greater consciousness of
the peasant, who were brave enough to stand up for an alternative view to the
government. </I>

<I>

<ICE-SIN:W1A-002#76:2>
<h> Introduction </h>

<ICE-SIN:W1A-002#77:2>
It cannot be denied that the points brought out in the question are
true.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-002#78:2>
That is, those points did occur in the mainland Southeast Asian
territories.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-002#79:2>
Robequain mentioned that the justification of colonisation is not by
looking at financial achievements alone ( Robequain 1944: 348).

<ICE-SIN:W1A-002#80:2>
Neither should one then look merely at these achievements as given,
without examining the flip-side to it.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-002#81:2>
One should ask then at what expense have these benefits been reached.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-002#82:2>
This will then help us come to some clearer picture of the situation
and whether the indigenous population did benefit from the economic changes
of the colonial ( semi-colonial) orders.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-002#83:2>
( a) Production of commodities, especially rice, increased
dramatically.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-002#84:2>
The actual production of rice did greatly rise.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-002#85:2>
However, the consumption of rice in Vietnam actually fell ( Scott,
1976: 87).

<ICE-SIN:W1A-002#86:2>
This was the situation even during the Great Depression.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-002#87:2>
What this meant was that though the production of rice was
increasing, much of it was being exported and did not actually reach the
mouths of the indigenous population.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-002#88:2>
In Burma, Tate suggests that though material progress was
experienced, the local people received a disproportionate share in the
country's new prosperity ( Tate, 1979: 144).

<ICE-SIN:W1A-002#89:2>
This was illustrated similarly in the poor distribution of the wages
in Indo-China.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-002#90:2>
In the 1930's the average wage rate of the whole of Indo-China
represented less than 1/12 of their French counterparts ( Tate, 1979: 345).

<ICE-SIN:W1A-002#91:2>
Where Siam is concerned, the distribution seemed fairer except what
they received was heavily taxed.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-002#92:2>
This shows clearly that at least in the colonially controlled areas,
though production increased, the indigenous people were not benefiting.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-002#93:2>
( b) Land area under cultivation expanded greatly.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-002#94:2>
More land was being used.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-002#95:2>
However the actual productivity of land is not mentioned.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-002#96:2>
In fact, Bastin and Benda assert that it did not ( 1968: 76-7).

<ICE-SIN:W1A-002#97:2>
As there is no limitless frontier, Burma experienced problems of land
shortage.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-002#98:2>
What this led to was a move to look for jobs, which in themselves
became pronouncedly scarce in the Depression years.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-002#99:2>
Though land was getting less and less available, the authorities did
not comprehend the situation enough to stop the problem.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-002#100:2>
So, although better farming methods and more high quality
fertilizers were introduced, they were not effective as the cost was high.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-002#101:2>
Moreover whatever credit facilities were provided benefited those
who were already well-to-do.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-002#102:2>
Mobility from tenants to landowners was kept to a minimal degree.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-002#103:2>
Soon, there were large numbers of peasants and a small group of
landowners.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-002#104:2>
Non-agriculturists who owned land increased from 18% in 1906-07 to
31% in 1929-30.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-002#105:2>
Though land area used increased, it did not actually benefit the
indigenous population to a large extent as land was in the hands of a few.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-002#106:2>
This too was also the case in Vietnam, Cochin-China to be exact.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-002#107:2>
However, in Burma, during the Great Depression, even the landowners
lost their property to the chettiar moneylenders.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-002#108:2>
Siam too suffered from the unequal distribution of land though it
does not seem to be as bad as the above in Burma.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-002#109:2>
( c) International trade, both exports and imports, boomed.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-002#110:2>
The situation here has to be viewed with a pinch of salt.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-002#111:2>
One should cast one's mind back to the signing of the unequal
treaties, beginning with the Bowning treaty in 1855.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-002#112:2>
These treaties gave protection over the colonial goods, which meant
that what profits they received would be at the expense of local profits (
Steinberg: 215).

<ICE-SIN:W1A-002#113:2>
Moreover Tate mentioned that trade in Vietnam carried on such that
the necessities of France were imported and sold to French people while the
Vietnamese were flooded with French luxury goods which they rarely needed or
could afford ( Tate, 1979: 345).

<ICE-SIN:W1A-002#114:2>
Aside from the above, international trade meant that the indigenous
people were in a more vulnerable position, as they were more open to the
fluctuations in prices and demand.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-002#115:2>
Where there were slumps or any other international economic
catastrophes, the people were to suffer even more.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-002#116:2>
Besides a greater burden being passed on to the colonially ruled
people ( Bastin and Benda, 1968: 79), the people of Thailand also suffered.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-002#117:2>
In the 1930s the people in the Angthong province depended on rice as
a staple income. <X>

<ICE-SIN:W1A-002#X118:2>
Due to the world-wide Depression, farmers and speculators suffered
severe losses.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-002#X119:2>
Jobs were difficult to get and there was a general fall in the
standard of living, as evidenced by the increasing number of middle and lower
class farmers ( Chatthip 1981: 199-206).

<ICE-SIN:W1A-002#X120:2>
There was a drop in income for farmers from 400 baht to 125 baht.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-002#X121:2>
The situation became so bad that families began to sell their gold
ornaments ( Chatthip 1981: 211-16).

<ICE-SIN:W1A-002#X122:2>
In Burma and Vietnam, the agriculturists also suffered.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-002#X123:2>
The real value of rice fell and with constantly increasing prices
against an unstable income, the situation was bad.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-002#X124:2>
Michael Adas actually suggests that even before the Depression
things were bad ( Adas 1974: 147).

<ICE-SIN:W1A-002#X125:2>
More importantly, the people of Burma were suffering from a loss of
the previously freely available resources of the forest.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-002#X126:2>
The British recognised the potential in the timber industry and
placed restrictions on the indigenous use of forest products, such as
taxation ( Scott, 1976: 63-65).

<ICE-SIN:W1A-002#X127:2>
What all these show in fact is that though international trade
boomed, the indigenous people did not seem to benefit in actuality.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-002#X128:2>
( d) Population grew rapidly, both through immigration and natural
births Without a doubt, population did increase.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-002#X129:2>
According to Bastin and Benda, it increased from 26m in 1830 to
123-odd m.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-002#X130:2>
in 1940.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-002#X131:2>
This was brought about by the colonial and semi-colonial
encouragement in immigration and also improved welfare of the people.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-002#X132:2>
Where there were deadly diseases like cholera, they were eventually
wiped out but anyhow reduced mortality rates.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-002#X133:2>
Moreover the population increase reflected the success somewhat of
economic change and the stability which the colonial governments brought to
areas like Burma and Indochina.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-002#X134:2>
Even where hospitals and medical improvements were scarce, they
were a first.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-002#X135:2>
However, the increasing immigrant population created a lot of
competition for jobs.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-002#X136:2>
In Burma, this led to much communal violence, culminating in the
1931 Saya San rebellion.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-002#X137:2>
Indians were seen as more efficient and the Burmese thus lost out
on jobs.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-002#X138:2>
With the presence of Chettiar moneylenders, the resentment
heightened.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-002#X139:2>
In Cambodia the indigenous population felt threatened too by the
Vietnamese present, who were filling up clerical and administrative posts.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-002#X140:2>
In Thailand the resentment was felt against the Chinese.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-002#X141:2>
The indigenous people were slowly becoming more dependent on the
Chinese ( Bastin and Benda 1968:75).

<ICE-SIN:W1A-002#X142:2>
Conclusion It appears that there are more negative effects than
positive.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-002#X143:2>
However, two points must be taken note of.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-002#X144:2>
The population increase in itself was a counter-effect to whatever
positive effects of economic change.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-002#X145:2>
Rather than continually pointing the finger at the colonial or
semi-colonial order, this local factor was also a reason for much hardship.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-002#X146:2>
Moreover, with the immigrant population tense situations were
created.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-002#X147:2>
Another point to note is the fact that whatever technological
advancement achieved must be attributed largely to the colonial presence.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-002#X148:2>
That is, if one were to imagine an advanced mainland Southeast Asia
without colonial initiation, it would be quite hard.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-002#X149:2>
However, David B.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-002#X150:2>
Johnston suggests that Thailand as an example of the absence of
formal colonial presence gives evidence of a more economically stabilised
country.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-002#X151:2>
This was due to the use of indigenous and not foreign capital and
labour.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-002#X152:2>
Moreover, being an independent nation, the incidence of
exploitation was not so rampant.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-002#X153:2>
He asserts that even Michael Adas agrees on the point that someday,
though at a slower pace, economic innovation and productivity would have been
reached.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-002#X154:2>
Of course, none of the countries involved here suffered massive
famine, but it seems to be that whatever Thailand did experience, it was a
much more watered down one than the other colonially ruled countries. </X>
