The order may not be the same as the way I have listed them.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-020#14:1>
A cassette will accompany the listening/speaking part in each unit.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-020#15:1>

recording studio.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-020#16:1>
Most of the stories will have to be read by an American or Americans,
with perhaps a few by other Westerners and/or Asians.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-020#17:1>
The topics covered should be in the areas of Everyday Living, Growing
Up and International Affairs/Events.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-020#18:1>
The contents should be about 70% Western/American and the rest Asian.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-020#19:1>
If you have any other ideas, feel free to discuss it with me.

MR CHIA SHYH CHIUAN, CHRIS ENGLISH LANGUAGE and LITERATURE

<ICE-SIN:W1B-020#71:4>
Dear Mr Chia

<ICE-SIN:W1B-020#72:4>
I am pleased to be able to tell you that the Universities Endowment
Fund has done quite well and about
&dollar;23 million has been collected in donations and pledges to date.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-020#73:4>
This has been due in no small way to your contributions.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-020#74:4>
As at 31 December 1992, NUS staff pledged and donated
&dollar;1.8 million.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-020#75:4>
It is encouraging to note that the support comes from a wide
crosssection of staff: from deans, lecturers, research staff and
administrative staff to campus wardens and cleaning attendants.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-020#76:4>
I would like to say on behalf of the Fund Raising Committee that we
are grateful to each and every one of you for your generosity and we hope to
have your continued support.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-020#77:4>
For those who have not donated to the Fund, it is not too late.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-020#78:4>
The UEF Secretariat Office at the Alumni Affairs and Development
Office, NUS, will be glad to answer any queries you have.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-020#79:4>
I myself graduated from the National University of Singapore, then
known as the University of Malaya.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-020#80:4>
I believe that graduates like myself are lucky to have received an
excellent education from the University and I consider it a great opportunity
to contribute to the education of the new generation of university students
upon whom the future of our nation depends.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-020#81:4>
Although some of you may not have graduated from this University, you
are very much a part of it because you are teaching and working in it.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-020#82:4>
I believe it will generate a sense of satisfaction for university
staff to donate something to their University through the Universities
Endowment Fund.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-020#83:4>
For NUS is indeed your University, and you should take pride that
your contribution as a member of staff of the University and a donor to the
UEF will help the University attain international renown as a centre of
academic excellence.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-020#84:4>
Your relationship with the University should not of course stop here.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-020#85:4>
There are so many activities on the campus where input from the
university staff will be very much appreciated.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-020#86:4>
One of the major projects we are organising is a 100-km Ultramarathon
on Sunday, 18 July 1993.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-020#87:4>
A brochure and registration form are enclosed for your information
and use.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-020#88:4>
Thank you once again for your support for the UEF.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-020#89:4>
I am pleased to work with you in contributing to the education of
university students on whom the future of our nation depends.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-020#90:4>
With warm regards

<ICE-SIN:W1B-020#91:4>

Dear Mr Fong

<ICE-SIN:W1B-020#119:6>
Thank you for your letter dated 19 July 1993.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-020#120:6>
Much as I have enjoyed Cetecea for its multi-layered references, I
am afraid it would not be possible to stage a full length play at the UN Day
Dinner owing to the constraints of time and technical facilities.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-020#121:6>
The stage at the Mandarin Ballroom is not properly equipped and the
acoustics of the place also leaves much to be desired.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-020#122:6>
As such, we would not be able to do full justice to your
miseen-scene.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-020#123:6>
However, the UN Day Dinner is not until October 23, so if you do
decide to change your mind, we would still be happy to accommodate a short
sketch of 15 to 20 minutes.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-020#124:6>
I am currently in charge of the Theatre Studies programme at the NUS
and have a group of fairly talented students who would be more than willing
to perform.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-020#125:6>
The occasion offers extremely good exposure.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-020#126:6>
I believe you are being unnecessarily modest, but will respect
whatever decision you make.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-020#127:6>
Incidentally, I am also researching a paper on sexual taboos and
their infringement in recent Singapore drama, and understand that you have
written a Mandarin play which might be of some interest.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-020#128:6>
I am fairly conversant in Mandarin and would appreciate a copy of
this play.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-020#129:6>
Let me end by wishing you every success in your creative endeavours.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-020#130:6>

 The United Nations Association of Singapore publishes two issues of
its journal World Forum annually, and 20000 copies of each are distributed to
government departments, civil organisations, all UN related agencies,
schools, libraries, as well as to our board of advisors.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-020#140:7>
 I understand that Ms Lena Leong has spoken to you on a previous
occasion concerning sponsorship for the forthcoming issues of World Forum.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-020#141:7>
 I am now writing to you with a formal request for sponsorship.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-020#142:7>
 Your assistance in this matter will be most deeply appreciated.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-020#143:7>

 16 January 1992

<ICE-SIN:W1B-020#158:8>
 Dear Kerrie JOINT PROMOTION WITH HOLIDAY INN PARK VIEW With
reference to your holidex dated 13 January to Mr Horsburgh, we have now had
another discussion on the proposed joint promotion with Holiday Inn Golden
Mile and can report to you on the following points:- 1) Holiday Inn Crowne
Plaza Bangkok has now agreed to participate in the programme.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-020#159:8>
 2) We are all in favour of the Bonus Coupon scheme but as we realise
time is of the essence, and given the fact that Holiday Inn Golden Mile due
to their existing package cannot embark on a similar project until July 1992,
we will have to think of an alternative promotion.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-020#160:8>
 However, we hope that Holiday Inn Golden Mile might still be willing
to consider implementing our version of the Bonus scheme in say, March 1992.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-020#161:8>
 3) The mechanics of the Bonus scheme are as follows:-

<ICE-SIN:W1B-020#162:8>
 a) Deluxe Room

<ICE-SIN:W1B-020#163:8>
 Single occupancy at S&dollar;190.00++

<ICE-SIN:W1B-020#164:8>
 Double occupancy at S&dollar;210.00++

<ICE-SIN:W1B-020#165:8>
 b) Executive Club Single occupancy at S&dollar;255.00++ Double occupancy at
S&dollar;285.00++

<ICE-SIN:W1B-020#166:8>
 Rates for the Executive Club are inclusive of the following:

<ICE-SIN:W1B-020#167:8>
 Guest will be eligible to accumulate bonus points on his master
bill.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-020#168:8>
 Welcome drink and fruit basket.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-020#169:8>
 Continental breakfast.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-020#170:8>
 Re-confirmation of air tickets.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-020#171:8>
 For every S&dollar;300 spent, the guest will earn 10 points.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-020#172:8>
 A complimentary room night in a Deluxe room is worth 100 points and
in an Executive Club room the value is 120 points.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-020#173:8>
 The promotion would run for two months and be redeemable in the
following two to three months.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-020#174:8>
 4) The main concern for all properties is that any one hotel might 'lose'
out if all they are doing is giving out free nights.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-020#175:8>
 Mr Horsburgh suggests that each hotel's coupons be colourcoded so
that at the end of the promotion, we can see which hotel gave away more
complimentary nights to which property.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-020#176:8>
 For all to break even therefore, a common value should be placed on
all coupons ( say one coupon is equivalent to S&dollar;160, 2,300 Baht and HK&dollar;800)
and arrangements can be made for each hotel to be paid back what it is owed.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-020#177:8>
 We hope to be able to iron out all the 'kinks' when everyone gets
together at the Sales and Marketing Conference in a few weeks time.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-020#178:8>
 In the meantime, I hope that this will be of some assistance to you.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-020#179:8>
 Thank you for your kind attention.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-020#180:8>
