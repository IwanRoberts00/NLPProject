<ICE-SIN:W2F-009#1:1>
<h> MY COUSIN TIM </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2F-009#2:1>
I REMEMBER TIM as I wait here and sweat under the green tent, the
backs of my thighs soaking under my black pants, the base of my spine marked
out on my black shirt, sitting on the red vinyl chair, picking at ground nuts
and kua-chi from the unsteady tables.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-009#3:1>
I don't play cards and haven't much to say to the other relatives.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-009#4:1>
My part of the family went down to Singapore when my father did his
university and never came back.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-009#5:1>
We've lost touch with almost all of them since and even my father has
trouble recognising Uncle Keong Tim's brother-in-law and some of his
cousins.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-009#6:1>
" Keong Tat's son", that's how I'm introduced and then I shake hands,
nod, ask whether they want a packet drink, get it for them if they do and go
back to my seat and sweat some more.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-009#7:1>
Tim's family was the only one we really kept in touch with.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-009#8:1>
First, because Uncle Keong Tim used to have business in Singapore, and
then because Tim, or Ek Tim as everyone called him then, couldn't pass Malay,
was sent down to study at my school and stayed with us.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-009#9:1>
We were 14 then.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-009#10:1>
I had just got my own room because Ee Lin, my eldest sister, was in
England studying.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-009#11:1>
The room wasn't really given to me, I just moved in.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-009#12:1>
First, I only slept there but then, slowly, my clothes, portable
cassette player and tennis rackets followed.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-009#13:1>
I was a squatter in a strangely pink room with frilly curtains.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-009#14:1>
Ee Lan complained: " Mum, I'm older, even Ee Cheng is older than him.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-009#15:1>
One of us should get Ee Lin's room, not him."

<ICE-SIN:W2F-009#16:1>
My mother had learnt by then to control the four of us by the skill
of caprice.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-009#17:1>
Her decisions were never consistent or ruled by any discernible
principle.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-009#18:1>
That made us think twice before bothering her with one of our
squabbles and leaving it to her to adjudicate who was right; we learnt in
this way to resolve things between ourselves by bargaining, trading or, most
of the time, fighting and shouting.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-009#19:1>
We were more unruly than my father might have liked, but none of us
could ever be accused of being a tattletale or mother's favourite.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-009#20:1>
Ee Lan tried her luck that day and failed.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-009#21:1>
I was a boy, my mother said, and it was best that I have my own room
until Ee Lin came back for holidays.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-009#22:1>
Ee Lan, 16, raged against the sexual discrimination of the entire
world, about jobs and the right to vote and how hunting animals was no longer
important and we were all equal now.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-009#23:1>
My mother, unmoved, kept cutting cucumbers for dinner.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-009#24:1>
To keep the peace as we grew, she persuaded my father to renovate and
build three extra rooms in the garden where his favourite papaya trees grew,
but that was much later.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-009#25:1>
I enjoyed my room for six months before Tim came to stay and share
it.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-009#26:1>
My mother broke the news to me.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-009#27:1>
She was sure we would get on, my cousin was a very nice, quiet boy,
very polite.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-009#28:1>
He played the piano - Grade Eight - and Auntie June often asked him
to play classical pieces after dinner.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-009#29:1>
This sort of news was less than impressive to me at an age when my
favourite singer was David Bowie.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-009#30:1>
Tim had to do a lot to convince me that his presence was anything but
an intrusion.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-009#31:1>
When he arrived he first made friends with my sisters.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-009#32:1>
He played piano while they tried to sing and dreamt of taking part in
Talentime.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-009#33:1>
Then he won my father over, listening to him talk about gardening and
fruit trees, helping him and the gardener on Saturdays.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-009#34:1>
He was a dark-eyed, fair boy with bak-pau cheeks, well groomed, short
hair, and a powerful frame which seemed too big and mature for the short
pants we wore to school.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-009#35:1>
He was good at all subjects and even his Malay, which had ruined him
for Malaysian schools, was fine by our standards.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-009#36:1>
His best subject was Maths.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-009#37:1>
It was something he had an instinct for; he was solving problems
before the teacher could and practising from a Sec Four book.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-009#38:1>
He was also a good runner, tennis player and played songs during
recess on the school piano in the hall, any number which our classmates
requested.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-009#39:1>
He was always nice, cheerful and helpful to everyone.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-009#40:1>
In a month he made more friends in the class than I, a bit of a
loner, had during the whole of Sec One.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-009#41:1>
I should have been jealous, I guess, and I think I would have been if
not for Tim.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-009#42:1>
He quietly spoke up for me with my family so my parents and even my
sisters occasionally saw my point of view, and our house became more
peaceful.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-009#43:1>
Every friend he made in school, he insisted get along with me and be
my friend too.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-009#44:1>
He helped me with Maths and my other weak subjects when we studied
together in that room, without ever acting too smart.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-009#45:1>
He always asked and deferred to me in Geography and History, which
were my strong subjects - up to then, I was doing well in them but came close
to failing the rest.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-009#46:1>
We played a lot of tennis together too, both at school team practices
and on our own.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-009#47:1>
All day on Saturdays and Sundays.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-009#48:1>
And, on Thursdays and Fridays, we'd wake up early - Tim leaning over
to nudge me after the alarm went - pack our uniforms into sports bags,
change, pick up our rackets and basket of tennis balls and go.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-009#49:1>
We'd play at the club until it was 11.00 and the sun was hot, almost
overhead - my rocket serve and forehand pitted against Tim's steadiness and
ability to exploit my awkward backhand - then shower or swim instead of
showering and rush off to school.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-009#50:1>
I improved, learnt to hit less wildly and played singles for the
school team.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-009#51:1>
One Saturday afternoon, we took on my father and another doctor who
had up to then confounded the directness of our youthful game with lobs and
drop shots, and we beat them for the first time.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-009#52:1>
The next year, when we were in morning session, we continued the
routine by simply reversing it and playing after school.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-009#53:1>
We won the under-16 Doubles Championships and Tim was the runner-up
in Singles.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-009#54:1>
Our school was champion that year and sometimes the girls at the club
would ask us to join them for a game and a swim after.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-009#55:1>
We both played for Combined Schools and wore our badges and track
tops around at every opportunity.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-009#56:1>
But if there was any one thing that really won me over, it was his
sense of humour.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-009#57:1>
Beneath that quiet, polite, eager, agreeable exterior, Tim had a vein
of wicked humour.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-009#58:1>
He breathed cutting asides to me in the very presence of the person
he was making fun of; our teachers, my father, his father, our tennis coach,
the giggly girls we'd meet.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-009#59:1>
These were too many to remember.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-009#60:1>
What I remember more clearly were the occasional pranks.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-009#61:1>
Tim was a great mimic.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-009#62:1>
Each Sunday night, in our room, he'd imitate my father giving his
latest lecture on gardening.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-009#63:1>
He telephoned Ee Lan and pretended he was the RTS newscaster she had
a crush on.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-009#64:1>
He called up our class monitor, a crew cut boy named Yew Huat, and,
mimicking our teacher, told him to go to the staff room early the next
morning for a meeting.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-009#65:1>
When Yew Huat later told us about the practical joke and
confidentially asked for our help to find out which of our classmates had
done it, I almost gagged trying not to laugh.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-009#66:1>
We had started out so different, but Tim grew darker and, with
exercise and our eating contests, I got taller and bigger.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-009#67:1>
By the end of that first year, people who just met us thought we were
brothers.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-009#68:1>
By the end of the third year, our discipline master Mr Tan caught Tim
for long hair and thought he was me.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-009#69:1>
To sit here on this occasion and think of these things saddens me.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-009#70:1>
I feel old when I touch these memories, not 33 but 63, my father's
age.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-009#71:1>
But I can't help myself.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-009#72:1>
I only visited this town, this house, to see Tim in the holidays when
he came home.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-009#73:1>
I see the market and hawker stalls where we temporarily escaped the
constant hunger of adolescence, the courts near the old tin quarries where
we'd play all afternoon, the river at the edge of town which made a natural
water slide from the rocks it had smoothed, where we'd swim in the hot
afternoons, and the street of narrow houses, stylish brothels during the tin
boom but run down even in our youth, where fat, dark women sat in the doorway
under the red light and called us as we each, laughing, tried to push the
other towards them.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-009#74:1>
I see the bungalow with its roof tiles still green and shiny, the
lions of prosperity by the gate, the garden and patio at its centre, where
Auntie June would trim her rose bushes at 4.30 and have tea, and the room Tim
and I would share.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-009#75:1>
I see them all as they were.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-009#76:1>
Nothing of the slow erosion of time and prosperity the town and house
have suffered registers in my mind.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-009#77:1>
My memories are fuelled by guilt: I lost touch with Tim some years
ago.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-009#78:1>
It was my work, first at university and then in the firm - a manager
in an accounting firm just has just too many partners to answer to and too
many juniors to lead.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-009#79:1>
It was my marriage.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-009#80:1>
These things must, I know, weigh more in the balance of things than
the friendship of a cousin, but when I sit here I cannot excuse myself.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-009#81:1>
I should have kept in touch with him We were 17 when he left.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-009#82:1>
One weekend, Uncle Keong Tim visited and told him and my parents the
plan after Sunday dinner.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-009#83:1>
Ek Tim was going to England.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-009#84:1>
There he would do his A-levels in a special school and finish them in
one year.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-009#85:1>
He would be in University by 18 and, because he was Malaysian and
didn't have to do Army, would be finished with his first degree by 21.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-009#86:1>
After all, Tim had gotten six P1s and two P2s in the exams.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-009#87:1>
My father said he thought it was an excellent idea and that he would
have done it too, but for the fact that I had to do NS.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-009#88:1>
I would go to university in England after that.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-009#89:1>
I had, my father recalled perfectly, five P1s ( not mentioning the
three P4s with which I had marred my certificate).

<ICE-SIN:W2F-009#90:1>
Maybe, my uncle finished, Ek Tim would still be there, doing his PhD.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-009#91:1>
Then the two brothers talked about the possibility of pooling their
resources to buy a flat in London so they wouldn't have to pay rent for us; a
place to stay when they visited on holiday and hold as an investment.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-009#92:1>
I was at the table still finishing my second helping.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-009#93:1>
I looked closely at my uncle as they spoke.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-009#94:1>
He was my father's younger brother, the second son of my grandfather,
but he had more white hair and wrinkles, looser skin and a buttery paunch
which he wore under a sports T-shirt.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-009#95:1>
These things might have made him look older than my father who kept
himself fairly slim, but he overcame them with joviality, a sense of
liveliness.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-009#96:1>
He was always willing to share a beer with us, to jokingly offer us a
cigarette before pointing to my father and saying that the doctor did not
approve.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-009#97:1>
Uncle Keong Tim was a businessman, a trader, and often said part of
his business was getting on with people.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-009#98:1>
He had other plans for Tim, though. <X>

<ICE-SIN:W2F-009#X99:1>
Something professional like an engineer or lawyer.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-009#X100:1>
As I looked at him and my father, I remembered an old family
photograph, taken when they were 18 and 17 respectively.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-009#X101:1>
There, posed formally in the studio on either side of my
grandparents, dressed in dark suits which my father kept the habit of
wearing, they looked so similar.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-009#X102:1>
Now they were unmistakably different.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-009#X103:1>
I wanted to say something about their plans for us, although it was
clear it was not my place to.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-009#X104:1>
It was just dazzling.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-009#X105:1>
Not just that our fathers knew our exact results, but that Tim was
leaving and the days of tennis and school work were going to dissolve.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-009#X106:1>
It seemed like we'd just been allowed to wear long pants to school
and go to parties where there were girls and, suddenly, our parents were
talking about us getting degrees and PhDs.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-009#X107:1>
Perhaps that was the first occasion I seriously thought about the
passage of time.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-009#X108:1>
I finished my food and kept quiet.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-009#X109:1>
Tim went in May, two months later, and things were never the same
again. </X> </I>
