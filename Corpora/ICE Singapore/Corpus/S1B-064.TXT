<I>

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#1:1:A>
Doctor Kong when you first saw the patient on the twentieth of
August nineteen ninety-one in your clinic were you aware that the Court had
already declared her to be of unsound mind

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#2:1:B>
I'm not aware of that fact

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#3:1:A>
Were you supplied with any medical reports prepared by Doctor
Ong or Woodbridge Hospital at the time when you examined

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#4:1:B>
No at the time when I examined her I have been told that there
was a doubt as to whether she was of sound mind and I then proceed to examine
her

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#5:1:A>
How long was your first interview

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#6:1:B>
I believe it was about one and a half to two hours I think

<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#7:1:B>
We set aside two hours

<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#8:1:B>
I recall having some time left over

<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#9:1:B>
So it must have been an hour and a half or slightly more than that

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#10:1:A>
With yourself

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#11:1:B>
Yes I interviewed the Plaintiff's husband

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#12:1:A>
Not just the patient alone

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#13:1:B>
My clerk was in the room with me because I need a interpreter

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#14:1:A>
How long you took to interview the patient alone

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#15:1:B>
Patient alone I would say for about

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#16:1:A>
First occasion

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#17:1:B>
Roughly an hour I would say

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#18:1:A>
Roughly an hour

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#19:1:B>
Yes

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#20:1:A>
Do you understand the Malay language doctor

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#21:1:B>
A little

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#22:1:A>
And how long did you interview the patient during the second
interview on the fourth of September nineteen ninety-one

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#23:1:B>
Second interview if I recall correctly

<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#24:1:B>
I think it's about forty-five minutes or so

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#25:1:A>
Forty-five minutes

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#26:1:B>
Yes about forty-five minutes

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#27:1:A>
And the dialogue was also in Malay language

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#28:1:B>
Yes I would put the question to my clerk

<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#29:1:B>
She translate it and she would respond to her

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#30:1:A>
So you would not be able to say whether the patient's
knowledge of the Malay language is good or poor

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#31:1:B>
I passed my Standard One Malay for all that is worth

<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#32:1:B>
I don't use it very often and so my facility with it was not that
great

<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#33:1:B>
But from the kind of words that my clerk was using to her I would
think that her command of language was quite good

<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#34:1:B>
Better than me at least

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#35:1:A>
You knew that she came from India to Singapore in nineteen
seventy-six

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#36:1:B>
Yes indeed

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#37:1:A>
And you were aware that this accident took place in nineteen
eighty-four

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#38:1:B>
Yes indeed

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#39:1:A>
In a matter of eight years the patient coming with only a
knowledge of Tamil language is able to speak good Malay

<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#40:1:A>
Would it not reflect that prior to the accident her I Q must have
been above average

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#41:1:B>
I think to learn a language and master a language one need not
be above average

<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#42:1:B>
Otherwise a lot of people would not be able to speak

<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#43:1:B>
I think it would be safe to say that to master a language
sufficiently an I Q even a borderline I Q should be able to pick up the
necessary language

<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#44:1:B>
You see that's the basis of the kind of training that are given to
educationally subnormal

<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#45:1:B>
They can learn languages and use it with facility

<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#46:1:B>
You see that's the basis

<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#47:1:B>
So it does not mean that just because she can master a language she
must therefore be above average

<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#48:1:B>
Then we are ruling out all the E S N's from learning any language
isn't it

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#49:1:A>
But the fact that she could pick up a new language in a new
environment would show that she had good intelligence

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#50:1:B>
I wouldn't say good intelligence

<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#51:1:B>
sufficient intelligence to learn a new language

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#52:1:A>
You did not ward her in any hospital to observe her

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#53:1:B>
No I did not

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#54:1:A>
And your report is based on these two short interviews you had
with her

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#55:1:B>
Based on it

<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#56:1:B>
Interviews plus the assessment

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#57:1:A>
Assessment reports

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#58:1:B>
That we had made

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#59:1:A>
Did she understand what this examination was all about

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#60:1:B>
This was put to her at the second session and as I said

<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#61:1:B>
She did not say whether she understood or don't understand

<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#62:1:B>
So I'm not able to ascertain that point

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#63:1:A>
Exactly your Honour

<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#64:1:A>
Now in your first interview you found her answers were vague and
unspontaneous and at times appeared inconsistent

<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#65:1:A>
What impression did you gather at that moment during your first
interview

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#66:1:B>
Well I leave an open mind

<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#67:1:B>
There are many possibilities and in my trade the fact that the
person has this trait could mean many things

<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#68:1:B>
There are many causes as you know for a person being vague and so
forth

<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#69:1:B>
And of course as results keep coming in then one becomes slowly
certain why she was vague etceteras

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#70:1:A>
Did you observe doctor that if you asked a leading question
she would easily answer yes

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#71:1:B>
No no

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#72:1:A>
For example if you ask her are you living at Telok Blangah

<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#73:1:A>
The answer would be yes

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#74:1:B>
No not true

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#75:1:A>
How was your questions put to her

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#76:1:B>
Some of the questions we get her to describe some were leading
questions

<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#77:1:B>
But I would think that the proportion would be fifty-fifty

<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#78:1:B>
In fact in psychiatric examination we are instructed that we do not
ask leading questions as much as we can

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#79:1:B>
Yes

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#80:1:A>
And the other questions

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#81:1:B>
Direct questions requiring a yes or no

<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#82:1:B>
And in some instances she didn't exactly give yes

<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#83:1:B>
In fact sometimes she give no

<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#84:1:B>
At the second interview do you watch T V

<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#85:1:B>
She says No

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#86:1:A>
Did you notice any difficulty in her shifting from one topic
to another

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#87:1:B>
No difficulty

<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#88:1:B>
In fact I do it very often in my interview

<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#89:1:B>
It's a technique I have developed to pick up certain things and I
move from one to the other

<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#90:1:B>
And I noticed that she was able to respond

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#91:1:A>
You look at page one of your report doctor at the bottom

<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#92:1:A>
She was complaining to you about her body pains and despite that
she was not able to point out exactly where the headache was

<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#93:1:A>
How do you explain that

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#94:1:B>
I can't explain that

<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#95:1:B>
I put it as a statement of fact that she can't

<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#96:1:B>
You see she was describing her symptoms and all that

<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#97:1:B>
So when she stopped I said well but where's the headache

<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#98:1:B>
And then she she didn't respond

<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#99:1:B>
So I don't know what to make out of that

<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#100:1:B>
It can be due to so many reasons isn't it

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#101:1:A>
A normal person doctor if he complains about stomach pain or
headache will tend to put the hand at the abdomen or in the forehead but not
so in this case

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#102:1:B>
Not so in that yes

<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#103:1:B>
The question is why

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#104:1:A>
Did it not strike that something was abnormal on her

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#105:1:B>
Well something is abnormal but the question then your Honour
is why would the person not respond

<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#106:1:B>
You see if you want to take the whole range you can say this is
due to brain damage

<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#107:1:B>
You can take the other extreme end and you can say that this is
malingering this is hysterical

<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#108:1:B>
It's a whole range you see

<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#109:1:B>
So I refuse to commit myself

<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#110:1:B>
I put it as a statement of fact

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#111:1:A>
You are aware that she had an injury to her frontal lobe

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#112:1:B>
Indeed

<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#113:1:B>
This was what she said as well or her husband said to the

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#114:1:A>
No I'm talking about the patient

<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#115:1:A>
Forget about the husband for the time being because your interview
is restricted to the patient

<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#116:1:A>
Did she complain to you anything else apart from the bodily pains

<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#117:1:A>
What did she complain of

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#118:1:B>
She complained of headaches her head bursting giddiness a lot
of symptoms in relation to the head

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#119:1:A>
And did you conduct any test for her memory

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#120:1:B>
Yes my psychologist did the Graham Kendall's Memory for
Design Test which showed eleven which is borderline up to about twenty-five
is considered borderline

<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#121:1:B>
I think roundabout seven is considered borderline

<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#122:1:B>
So she I would say she get quite a high score

<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#123:1:B>
The lower the score the normal it is

<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#124:1:B>
The higher the score the more abnormal it is

<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#125:1:B>
So we didn't arrange a borderline from say seven to about
twenty-four

<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#126:1:B>
She score about eleven which I think is quite good

<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#127:1:B>
Obviously she has definite memory deficits but her memory deficits
strike me on the testing as mild

<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#128:1:B>
It's considered borderline

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#129:1:A>
But she had some difficulty performing the task

<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#130:1:A>
She was slow

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#131:1:B>
Yes she was slow which my psychologist document

<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#132:1:B>
You can read that in his report

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#133:1:A>
Now did you find out what was her attitude towards her
children

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#134:1:B>
I did ask her about her children and she says she's quite
happy with the children

<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#135:1:B>
And she said that they were good to her

<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#136:1:B>
So I put her a direct question

<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#137:1:B>
So are you therefore happy with them

<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#138:1:B>
She just kind of again stared blankly

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#139:1:A>
No answer

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#140:1:B>
No answer

<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#141:1:B>
So she doesn't answer yes to direct questions that's one and two

<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#142:1:B>
Her response again would indicate a wide variety of conditions

<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#143:1:B>
So I feel that it's I would put it down as a matter of fact rather
than comment on it

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#144:1:A>
Did you also observe that in one moment she would say
something and the next moment she'll forget

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#145:1:B>
Not all the time

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#146:1:A>
But were there instances of such

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#147:1:B>
There were perhaps one or two instances when she would behave
like that

<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#148:1:B>
Again the significance of this behaviour like with this is open to
question

<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#149:1:B>
It can be argued

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#150:1:A>
For example doctor you said that you were asking about the
children and finally you put a question to her

<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#151:1:A>
And the answer is negative

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#152:1:B>
Yes

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#153:1:A>
How would you explain to that condition

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#154:1:B>
Well as I said there are many different explanations from
that

<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#155:1:B>
It can be due to depression

<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#156:1:B>
It can be due to brain damage

<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#157:1:B>
Can be due to malingering or hysteria

<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#158:1:B>
Whatever one can put to it you see

<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#159:1:B>
There's a whole range of explanations

<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#160:1:B>
For instance when I asked her how many legs a dog has and she
don't respond for a minute

<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#161:1:B>
I thought that she won't say anything

<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#162:1:B>
So I was very pleasantly surprised when she says four

<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#163:1:B>
I'm glad I waited

<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#164:1:B>
Had I been impatient I would have lost that

<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#165:1:B>
So I'm not sure whether in fact you know one can say it's due to
brain damage

<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#166:1:B>
I mean the causes of such responses such behavioural responses are
many

<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#167:1:B>
And at this point in time I want just to describe what actually
happened and state it there

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#168:1:A>
Did you discuss with her about what plan she has for her
family her sons

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#169:1:B>
We tried to but she doesn't want to consider that

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#170:1:A>
There was no response

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#171:1:B>
Well she showed by her demeanour that she doesn't want to
respond to it

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#172:1:A>
In such circumstances doctor

<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#173:1:A>
Do you think that she would be able to live independently

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#174:1:B>
I think again it's very hard to say

<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#175:1:B>
Why would a person not be interested to discuss the future

<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#176:1:B>
I think again one can think of a variety of causes that can cause
a person to act and behave in that way

<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#177:1:B>
And I do not want to straitjacket myself and say it is due to this
one thing or put it down first and let's consider what other possible causes

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#178:1:A>
Do you think that she'll be able to lead an independent life

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#179:1:B>
I think so because in my view I am increasingly convinced
looking at Doctor Ong's report that a lot of it all could be due to phobic
anxiety

<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#180:1:B>
And a large degree I think to a depression that probably I
hesitate to say this

<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#181:1:B>
But I think it's probably inadequately treated

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#182:1:A>
Suppose you give her a ten dollar note doctor and ask her to
go down to the market just below her apartment and do the daily marketing for
the day

<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#183:1:A>
Do you think she'll be able to carry out that function

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#184:1:B>
Well Doctor Ong says that she could handle small amount of
money in one of his earlier reports

<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#185:1:B>
If that's the case I would expect that if we can overcome the
phobia and get her out of the home

<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#186:1:B>
On the basis of what Doctor Ong said

<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#187:1:B>
I would say yes

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#188:1:A>
But at this moment do you think she would be able to <X>

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#X189:1:B>
At this moment a lot of motives will contaminate the
behaviour isn't it

<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#X190:1:B>
Motives of tranquil

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-064#X191:1:A>
My question is at this moment do you think she would be able
to carry out the function of a housewife like going to the market </X> </I>
