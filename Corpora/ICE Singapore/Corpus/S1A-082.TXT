<I>

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-082#1:1:A>
So what are you going to do at Takashimaya afterwards

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-082#2:1:B>
I don't know

<ICE-SIN:S1A-082#3:1:B>
Actually there's nothing right

<ICE-SIN:S1A-082#4:1:B>
There's nothing much to do there right I mean

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-082#5:1:A>
Yah unless you are buying something

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-082#6:1:B>
Buying so expensive

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-082#7:1:A>
Well I mean you don't have to work

<ICE-SIN:S1A-082#8:1:A>
You don't have buy at Studio lah I suppose

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-082#9:1:B>
Yah yah But anyway I think Studio hah they don't open on Sunday

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-082#10:1:A>
But today is not Sunday what

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-082#11:1:B>
Yah lah yah lah I mean they don't open on Sundays

<ICE-SIN:S1A-082#12:1:B>
Do they follow the Tangs one

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-082#13:1:A>
Oh yah ah yah yah yah

<ICE-SIN:S1A-082#14:1:A>
Probably they do lah

<ICE-SIN:S1A-082#15:1:A>
Once they had this interview you know with uh the old C K Tang ah
not his son or what

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-082#16:1:B>
Is it

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-082#17:1:A>
And then they were asking him why why is it their store does
not open on Sunday you know

<ICE-SIN:S1A-082#18:1:A>
Because they were the reporter was quite curious because Sunday is
the day where most of the stores make their money you see

<ICE-SIN:S1A-082#19:1:A>
Saturdays and Sundays weekdays much less so ah

<ICE-SIN:S1A-082#20:1:A>
Then the man the man just said well after a certain point you just
have to say you just have to know when to stop lah

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-082#21:1:B>
You mean stop earning money ah

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-082#22:1:A>
In the sense that not money is not everything you see

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-082#23:1:B>
Yah right

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-082#24:1:A>
To him lah

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-082#25:1:B>
And I heard he is a very devout Christian and uh he follows
the Sabbath

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-082#26:1:A>
Ya lah ya lah that is why lah

<ICE-SIN:S1A-082#27:1:A>
Because I probably they were thinking like aiyah we have so many
millions already you know what is another couple of millions

<ICE-SIN:S1A-082#28:1:A>
I know they some of the Tang clan or what family or what they
attend this church at uh Queenstown

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-082#29:1:B>
Is it

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-082#30:1:A>
Yah it is called Church of our Saviour and I know that one of
the weekly bible studies right

<ICE-SIN:S1A-082#31:1:A>
It is held in the Tang's boardroom

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-082#32:1:B>
It is held at

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-082#33:1:A>
Tang boardroom

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-082#34:1:B>
Tang boardroom

<ICE-SIN:S1A-082#35:1:B>
Really ah

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-082#36:1:A>
Yah I told you right

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-082#37:1:B>
Yah lor yah lor

<ICE-SIN:S1A-082#38:1:B>
Anyway are they a big family

<ICE-SIN:S1A-082#39:1:B>
They control the whole

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-082#40:1:A>
Empire

<ICE-SIN:S1A-082#41:1:A>
They own Tangs Studio and I think I am not sure lah this one

<ICE-SIN:S1A-082#42:1:A>
I think Dynasty Hotel

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-082#43:1:B>
No I mean the management is it like

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-082#44:1:A>
No the own it

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-082#45:1:B>
Yah but that means the top-level management

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-082#46:1:A>
Yah lah yah lah yah lah

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-082#47:1:B>
is occupied by the their own relatives or what

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-082#48:1:A>
Yah lah

<ICE-SIN:S1A-082#49:1:A>
The son lah I suppose

<ICE-SIN:S1A-082#50:1:A>
The old sons of C K Tang

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-082#51:1:B>
They used to have small neighbourhood shops down at Macpherson

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-082#52:1:A>
Ah hah

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-082#53:1:B>
Uhm one at I think at Katong and uh yah one at Macpherson and
one at Katong

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-082#54:1:A>
Ah hah

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-082#55:1:B>
because uh my grandpa used to like buy liquor from them

<ICE-SIN:S1A-082#56:1:B>
They sell liquor you know

<ICE-SIN:S1A-082#57:1:B>
One of the one of the accountant <unclear> word </unclear> yah the
old whisky type and then they sell the very old type the the one with the old
Chinese uhm god you know that guy with the bald head you know

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-082#58:1:A>
But anyway anyway I think of all the local stores ah I mean
the department stores they are one of the ones who are doing better lah

<ICE-SIN:S1A-082#59:1:A>
Like you see Metro keeps closing you know right

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-082#60:1:B>
They they I think they stocked quite intelligently because
they does they they don't just like

<ICE-SIN:S1A-082#61:1:B>
Anyway anyway all shopping centres look alike

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-082#62:1:A>
Yah lah

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-082#63:1:B>
but they all there are very strange and interesting items you
see

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-082#64:1:A>
Like like Studio Tangs lah

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-082#65:1:B>
Yah yah

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-082#66:1:A>
This niche marketing lah

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-082#67:1:B>
Yah for the young one

<ICE-SIN:S1A-082#68:1:B>
Yah like the Tangs is reserved for

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-082#69:1:A>
quite high class one

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-082#70:1:B>
And more general audience yah

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-082#71:1:A>
Aye even Tangs is quite high class one you know

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-082#72:1:B>
Yah lah yah lah

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-082#73:1:A>
all those stuff

<ICE-SIN:S1A-082#74:1:A>
Not cheap at all

<ICE-SIN:S1A-082#75:1:A>
But then I think it would be hard work man

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-082#76:1:B>
Yah

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-082#77:1:A>
But then but then if you notice most of the department stores
in Singapore are Japanese you know

<ICE-SIN:S1A-082#78:1:A>
It is their fad correct

<ICE-SIN:S1A-082#79:1:A>
You see Yaohan one Isetan two Tokyu three Daimaru four Takashimaya
five Sogo six

<ICE-SIN:S1A-082#80:1:A>
It is their third retail

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-082#81:1:B>
<unclear> word </unclear>

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-082#82:1:A>
Ah it is practically new form of Japanese imperialism

<ICE-SIN:S1A-082#83:1:A>
The only the only non-Japanese ones are Galeries Tangs

<ICE-SIN:S1A-082#84:1:A>
That is all what

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-082#85:1:B>
Galeries Tangs

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-082#86:1:A>
Robinsons ah Robinsons

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-082#87:1:B>
Metro

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-082#88:1:A>
Metro John Littles

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-082#89:1:B>
Yah

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-082#90:1:A>
That is all

<ICE-SIN:S1A-082#91:1:A>
Mostly Japanese

<ICE-SIN:S1A-082#92:1:A>
More than half uh

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-082#93:1:B>
Some more Japanese are more aggressive

<ICE-SIN:S1A-082#94:1:B>
They upgrade very fast

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-082#95:1:A>
Like you know uhm

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-082#96:1:B>
keep upgrading

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-082#97:1:A>
You know why

<ICE-SIN:S1A-082#98:1:A>
Because they have so many in Japan right

<ICE-SIN:S1A-082#99:1:A>
That that one here uh that one here right can draw from the
Japanese resources you see while Tangs only has one shop here

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-082#100:1:B>
Yah lah yah lah

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-082#101:1:A>
You know what I mean

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-082#102:1:B>
Yah

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-082#103:1:A>
There is a difference uh

<ICE-SIN:S1A-082#104:1:A>
Wah here damn sleepy man

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-082#105:1:B>
Yah all the food uh

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-082#106:1:A>
Yah I need to walk it off uh

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-082#107:1:B>
Actually I am supposed to go swimming today

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-082#108:1:A>

<ICE-SIN:S1A-082#109:1:B>

Too powerful never mind

<ICE-SIN:S1A-082#121:1:A>

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-082#222:1:A>
Yah yah yah

<ICE-SIN:S1A-082#223:1:A>
I didn't know N T U had a Arts Department

<ICE-SIN:S1A-082#224:1:A>
I think he moved to N T U you see right

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-082#225:1:B>
Yah it is conjoined N I E lah

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-082#226:1:A>
He used to be here lah then I think he left uh

<ICE-SIN:S1A-082#227:1:A>
Then after that a few of them left with him

<ICE-SIN:S1A-082#228:1:A>
Kirpal Singh not left with him lah

<ICE-SIN:S1A-082#229:1:A>

<ICE-SIN:S1A-082#230:1:A>
I think Max Le Blond is no longer here right

<ICE-SIN:S1A-082#231:1:A>
Uh Kirpal Singh

<ICE-SIN:S1A-082#232:1:A>
Still got who uh

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-082#233:1:B>
I think it is more challenging opening up a new department
than simply staying around

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-082#234:1:A>
Oh yah lah but I suppose if you are too comfortable here ah
you may not want to bother lah

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-082#235:1:B>
Yah

<ICE-SIN:S1A-082#236:1:A>
Correct

<ICE-SIN:S1A-082#237:1:A>
Besides I mean it's they can't doing all that much different stuff
and right

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-082#238:1:B>
Yah but I suppose they have the freedom to do a lot more
things lah because

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-082#239:1:A>
True lah

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-082#240:1:B>

<ICE-SIN:S1A-082#241:1:A>
Yah lah yah lah yah lah yah yah

<ICE-SIN:S1A-082#242:1:A>
That is true

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-082#243:1:B>

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-082#244:1:A>

<ICE-SIN:S1A-082#271:1:A>
