Dear Jeanette,

<ICE-SIN:W1B-004#2:1>
Finally, I got down to reply your letter.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-004#3:1>
It was school exams, followed by invigilation and school admin for the
past 1 month.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-004#4:1>
Am having a 2-day break before assuming invigilation for A.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-004#5:1>
Maths.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-004#6:1>
Nice to hear from you and appreciate your effort to keep in touch.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-004#7:1>
As I grow older, I can't help but conclude that working adults are
less faithful in keeping in touch.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-004#8:1>
Thanks for the initiative.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-004#9:1>
How's papers so far, esp.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-004#10:1>
Maths?

<ICE-SIN:W1B-004#11:1>
Learn something abt yourself and friends and God during this "
traumatic period"?

<ICE-SIN:W1B-004#12:1>
Be it during exams or vacation, it's fun and meaningful to aim a "
bettering" today over tomorrow.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-004#13:1>
Now to reply your questions: ' 91 has been a gd year.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-004#14:1>
Not that there's no unpleasant or difficult moments, but on the
whole, a year I've enjoyed, learned new things and grown ( for the better, of
course).

<ICE-SIN:W1B-004#15:1>
Only bumped into Hwee Choo and boyfriend once.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-004#16:1>
Think they attend 1st service.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-004#17:1>
I attend 3rd mostly.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-004#18:1>
" Pals" of my age - I meet them and catchup at people's wedding.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-004#19:1>
But still talk like old friends once we hit off.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-004#20:1>
From your sharing - you sound purposeful with what you want to do
with yourself.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-004#21:1>
Gd!

<ICE-SIN:W1B-004#22:1>
Always be teachable and always concern yourself with the right thing
at the right time.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-004#23:1>
Guess studies, at the time of your writing, is such an oppressive
burden.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-004#24:1>
Sounded unhealthily worried and nervous I hope it's just that moment.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-004#25:1>
If it is preoccupying more and more, like as if heading for nervous
breakdown, then seek help from people who can help.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-004#26:1>
Sometimes, difficulties with studies may due to ineffective and
inefficient study skills and methods.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-004#27:1>
It'll be good to do some research, I mean read up, about study skills
and methods, and see if yours can be improved on.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-004#28:1>
Books can be found in National Library - ask info.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-004#29:1>
Counter for help if necessary.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-004#30:1>
Above all, enjoy and unwind this vacation.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-004#31:1>
Learn to relax healthily.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-004#32:1>
You seemed stressed.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-004#33:1>
If you've friends who want to have a meaningful Christmas, 'cos they
never know one before, make a date and come down to FCBC's " Come Celebrate
Christmas".

<ICE-SIN:W1B-004#34:1>
This season is always full of opportunity to tell people of God's
Love and Christ.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-004#35:1>
FCBC is excitedly preparing for it this period.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-004#36:1>
Am personally excited too.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-004#37:1>
Happy hols and blessed Christmas!

<ICE-SIN:W1B-004#38:1>

<ICE-SIN:W1B-004#40:1>
P/S: Rec'd your " Thank you" card.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-004#41:1>
Like I've always tell myself, as long as I've done my best, I won't
rebuke myself and know that I've pleased God, myself and my parents since
it's the best that I've given.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-004#42:1>
So if you've given what you can, go and have this holiday with a free
spirit. </I>

<I>

<ICE-SIN:W1B-004#43:2>
Dear Indra,

<ICE-SIN:W1B-004#44:2>
Thanks ever so much for your letter, you were right I was getting a
little worried that you had forgotten all about me.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-004#45:2>
Actually, I wrote you another letter but I brought these aerogrammes
today and decided to use these instead, from now on.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-004#46:2>
My budget is getting too tight, Mary still haven't sent me the money
she owes me.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-004#47:2>
I'm beginning to hate her more and more.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-004#48:2>
I hope I get it before the end of this month or else I'm going to
send her a nasty postcard, maybe her dad might see it.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-004#49:2>
College is fine, making more friends.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-004#50:2>
Getting pretty fed up and bored hanging out with the fat Spanish girl
Judith and the dim black girl, Hazel from Slough.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-004#51:2>
Judith likes this Spanish guy Freddy in our econs and stats class.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-004#52:2>
She takes French with him too and whenever he joins us at the table
she cuts me out totally by rattling away in Spanish.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-004#53:2>
He is nice and always chats with me and sits next to me in the stats
class, which she doesn't take.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-004#54:2>
As for Miss Slough, she is really weird and quite dumb.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-004#55:2>
You can look at her and ask her a question and she just gives you a
blank stare.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-004#56:2>
Well I'm getting more friendly with these 3 girls who are in most of
my classes, Miki ( Japanese) Kana ( ? ) and a Malaysian girl who hangs out
with them, smiles a lot too.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-004#57:2>
Probably better to start hanging out with them.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-004#58:2>
Much nicer not jealous or dim ( respectively for Judith and Hazel).

<ICE-SIN:W1B-004#59:2>
It's only a month and I can't stand same people but you would react
the same way if you were me.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-004#60:2>
Anyway all else aside I love going to college hitting the books.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-004#61:2>
I'm quite into it right now.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-004#62:2>
I'm even taking a side course in Western Civilization in Medieval and
Renaissance history.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-004#63:2>
It's a real change from the other tasteless business subjects.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-004#64:2>
Anita is alright.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-004#65:2>
I was down with the flu for 2 weeks and she was sweet to see to me
but ended up getting the flu herself, so I had to look after her in return.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-004#66:2>
I'm also pleased to inform you that she lives on the 7th floor and me
on the 2nd, in a way it's good because we don't see so much of each other so
we avoid a lot of conflicts.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-004#67:2>
But I go up to her room every evening to watch a little TV or she
comes down for short visits, usually to have a cigarette.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-004#68:2>
So Prof.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-004#69:2>
Thumboo wants you to work for NUS Theatre.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-004#70:2>
How very interesting, make sure they pay you a good salary because I
can foresee a lot of work dumped your way.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-004#71:2>
Beware!

<ICE-SIN:W1B-004#72:2>
Should they require a temporary clerical assistant or whatever from
May to August be sure to keep me in mind.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-004#73:2>
Yes, I'm coming home for the summer.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-004#74:2>
Yah!

<ICE-SIN:W1B-004#75:2>
I'm dying to see you again to resume the Sunday nights at Emerald
Hill, our own secret corner, just like when we were children, though we never
played together but you knew what I mean.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-004#76:2>
I heard that Allysan's engagement party was very traditional.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-004#77:2>
Sam wrote to me about and she said she was somewhat surprised that
there were Indian women with trays of gifts lining up outside my house.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-004#78:2>
So weird!

<ICE-SIN:W1B-004#79:2>
As for my father's behaviour, I'm not the least surprised.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-004#80:2>
He always puts his pride above all else even at the expense of
Allysan's happiness.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-004#81:2>
I hope that Allysan and Sinder will get married and be happy.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-004#82:2>
It's amazing that they've lasted this long.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-004#83:2>
How is Shareen and Alvin these days, my eldest sister never writes.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-004#84:2>
I'll have to deal with her when I come home.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-004#85:2>
Getting a fucking job here is impossible, anyway it's much better to
come home for the hols.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-004#86:2>
Please don't tell anyone that I'll be home in mid may cause the fewer
people who know it, the better.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-004#87:2>
Slowly I'm cutting off ties with a lot of friends at home.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-004#88:2>
As for Mary, it's definitely the end, maybe not altogether but it's
definitely going to be at that superficial stage once I come home.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-004#89:2>
Much like how is it with Jacqueline, Susanna and Grace.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-004#90:2>
Sad isn't it?

<ICE-SIN:W1B-004#91:2>
But frankly I don't care.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-004#92:2>
I'll always have good friends like Monica, Martini, Lynn etc not
forgetting my family, Sam you and my other cousins.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-004#93:2>
Wah!

<ICE-SIN:W1B-004#94:2>
So drama.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-004#95:2>
I'm happy to hear that your GRE went all.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-004#96:2>
So I guess it'll be Hello!

<ICE-SIN:W1B-004#97:2>
America in 1994.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-004#98:2>
I may be able to get that exchange programme I applied for in Chicago
as I'm not at EBS doing languages so Regent's College say I can apply.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-004#99:2>
In case you've confused RC houses e EBS, School of Counselling
Psychotherapy, College of Radiology, Bell lust of languages.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-004#100:2>
Very diversified and you have a wide choice of schools of learning.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-004#101:2>
RC is opening a new faculty next term, they only have arts and
sciences and they are introducing LLB ( law) into the curriculum.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-004#102:2>
Not that I'm any interested but you'll be sure that we'll be getting
a fair share of 'big mouths'.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-004#103:2>
Went to the library yesterday and had to change my Student
pass/library card whatever and the guy at the desk teased me.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-004#104:2>
He said you want to change your EBS card to RC generated then what
about next month, Bell lust etc.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-004#105:2>
Cheeky Bastard.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-004#106:2>
Been eating hellava lot lately, too much if you ask me.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-004#107:2>
Be prepared to see me come home a fat bitch and leave home again a
scarecrow.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-004#108:2>
I put on and lose weight like a pendulum.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-004#109:2>
But I get so bored and too expensive to go out so I borrow a library
book and pig out all the time.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-004#110:2>
Sad huh!

<ICE-SIN:W1B-004#111:2>
I'm pleased to say I got an 'A' on my first Business English paper,
believe it on the environment and a 'B' in my Statistics.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-004#112:2>
I hope I can do as well for my economics, history and computing.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-004#113:2>
I enjoy computer lessons the most, even if it's the most tedious,
the lecturer is a real nice lady.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-004#114:2>
She's also my tutor.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-004#115:2>
She's a block lady in her mid thirties.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-004#116:2>
Very, very patient and understanding.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-004#117:2>
Had brunch with Marcella last Saturday.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-004#118:2>
She called me over to her place down the street.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-004#119:2>
Then we went to see a photography exhibition on pre and postwar
France.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-004#120:2>
It was really interesting.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-004#121:2>
She's not quite as ambiguous now, thank goodness!

<ICE-SIN:W1B-004#122:2>
She off to Venice this week to meet some French/Persian guy.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-004#123:2>
Wah!

<ICE-SIN:W1B-004#124:2>
some people have all the luck.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-004#125:2>
Anna was ill last week so I didn't see her.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-004#126:2>
Didn't see Sharon last week either as she's works all the time, the
poor thing.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-004#127:2>
Well, hope I didn't bore you.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-004#128:2>
Do write as often as you can.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-004#129:2>
I miss you very, very, very much.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-004#130:2>
Take care.

Dear Chris,

<ICE-SIN:W1B-004#134:3>
It was good to speak with you and to have the chance to be your
guest at lunch.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-004#135:3>
Do keep in touch.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-004#136:3>
So far the Planned Parenthood Association has not decided on the
date for the volunteer training programme for resident speakers.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-004#137:3>
I will be happy to take care of your insurance or investment needs
at any time.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-004#138:3>
Do keep me informed when you are ready to make a decision.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-004#139:3>
My new telephone no is 7354324.

Dearest Charmusaki,

<ICE-SIN:W1B-004#146:4>
I was just about to send you this card to tell you that I've moved
when my mother told me that you'll be stopping in SF for awhile.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-004#147:4>
Maybe I can get Jean and Iain to fly up too.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-004#148:4>
They are only 45 mins away by plane but I haven't had the chance to
go visit them lately.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-004#149:4>
Well, let me tell you about my new place.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-004#150:4>
It's a 2 bedroom unit with a tiny little backyard and located very
close to downtown.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-004#151:4>
In fact I take the cable car to the train station everyday.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-004#152:4>
I'm sharing this place with Leo and so far we've managed to survive
the move ( we both have a lot of things).

<ICE-SIN:W1B-004#153:4>
Anyhow, you must come and stay with us while you're here.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-004#154:4>
I'll take a few days off to play with you in the city and run about
sight seeing/ shoppping etc It'll be a lot of fun.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-004#155:4>
Well, I hope everything is going alright for you.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-004#156:4>
I'm sure I'll be hearing from you soon.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-004#157:4>
Just in case, my office no ( 510) 549-1234.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-004#158:4>
Looking forward to seeing you soon.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-004#159:4>
Regards to your family.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-004#160:4>
Take care.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-004#161:4>
God Bless.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-004#162:4>

P/S How's Dawn doing in NZ? </I>

<I>

<ICE-SIN:W1B-004#165:5>
Dear Edward,

<ICE-SIN:W1B-004#166:5>
By the end of this year you'll graduate.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-004#167:5>
Glad to know that you're coming to Singapore.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-004#168:5>
Will certainly try to meet up with you despite my hectic schedule.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-004#169:5>
Are you also here to look for a job?

<ICE-SIN:W1B-004#170:5>
Will you have any difficulty with the immigration department since
you went away to Australia without completing your NS?

<ICE-SIN:W1B-004#171:5>
I am quite shock to learn that Pastor Mark is still in Perth.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-004#172:5>
I thought he was supposed to go to Adelaide to assist Reverend
Powell?

<ICE-SIN:W1B-004#173:5>
I heard about his plans to study in the States too, perhaps his
plans didn't work out.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-004#174:5>
What's happening to BPCWA?

<ICE-SIN:W1B-004#175:5>
Why did Pastor Peter want to resign? <X>

<ICE-SIN:W1B-004#X176:5>
Are you still attending this church?

<ICE-SIN:W1B-004#X177:5>
How's the YF there?

<ICE-SIN:W1B-004#X178:5>
I'm sure it's not quite the same since we left.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-004#X179:5>
It must have been a lot more quieter and the group smaller.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-004#X180:5>
Have you made any new friends there?

<ICE-SIN:W1B-004#X181:5>
Sharon and Elaine should be completing their course soon.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-004#X182:5>
Elaine might have another semester to go as she is repeating some
unit.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-004#X183:5>
Good to hear from you and let's keep in touch.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-004#X184:5>
Looking forward to seeing you in about four months' time.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-004#X185:5>
Take care and God bless.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-004#X186:5>
Love-in-Christ, Paul Huang </X> </I>
