<ICE-SIN:S2B-046#1:1:A>
Basically I'll discuss on two topics

<ICE-SIN:S2B-046#2:1:A>
The first topic is the use of Singapore literature in relation to
the Singaporean dictionary of English

<ICE-SIN:S2B-046#3:1:A>
And secondly I'll discuss the top ah uh I'll discuss the topic of
the users of the dictionary in relation to Singaporean literature in English

<ICE-SIN:S2B-046#4:1:A>
Uh I do not know if I've much time for the second part of it but
I'll try my best uh uh say what I want to say uh in regard to both topics

<ICE-SIN:S2B-046#5:1:A>
There is a long established tradition of using works in of
literature as a source for citations in lexicography

<ICE-SIN:S2B-046#6:1:A>
The Arabic lexicographers in the eighth century for instance
included citations from literary works in their dictionary

<ICE-SIN:S2B-046#7:1:A>
And what has been regarded as a first of the big dictionaries of
modern standard languages

<ICE-SIN:S2B-046#8:1:A>
An Italian dictionary published in 1612 is based in words of

<ICE-SIN:S2B-046#9:1:A>
Almost exclusively on exception from the foreign time writers of the
fourteenth century

<ICE-SIN:S2B-046#10:1:A>
When it comes to lexicography in English from Dr Johnson's
dictionary with his various quotations from literary works of English and of
the OED and its supplement and Webster's

<ICE-SIN:S2B-046#11:1:A>
Considering the long established tradition of the inclusion of data
from literary works compilation of dictionaries

<ICE-SIN:S2B-046#12:1:A>
It does seems odd that apart from the panel discussion just now
there is only one people out of twenty in this workshop which deals with
literary works and lexicography

<ICE-SIN:S2B-046#13:1:A>
Literary works are even more important if one considers the
inclusion of quotations from them in the dictionaries' citation files without
their actual inclusion in the dictionary itself

<ICE-SIN:S2B-046#14:1:A>
It would thus be of interest for us to look at some of the general
conceptions of principles involved whether explicit or implicit selection of
lexicographic data from literary works

<ICE-SIN:S2B-046#15:1:A>
As looking at these conceptions of principles may help us to gain a
clearer understanding of how one may use citations from literary works in the
lexicographic files in relations to Singapore English

<ICE-SIN:S2B-046#16:1:A>
And of deep potential problems that one may encounter here towards
the end of my talk

<ICE-SIN:S2B-046#17:1:A>
I will also discuss the needs of the users for dictionary of
Singaporean English in relations to Singapore literature with reference to
the use of literary works in lexicography maybe use

<ICE-SIN:S2B-046#18:1:A>
It may be helpful for us to look at the principles of selection of
or attitudes towards data from literary works as it was practised in the
compilation of the supplement to the OED

<ICE-SIN:S2B-046#19:1:A>
Robert Birchfield who is the general editor of supplement has
mentioned about his decision uh to include the vocabulary of our greatest
modern writers in the supplement

<ICE-SIN:S2B-046#20:1:A>
Among them TS Eliot Virginia Woolf Evelyn Waugh WH Auden and even
Dylon Thomas and James Joyce except for most of

<ICE-SIN:S2B-046#21:1:A>
I thought the lights would be off but anyway's still on the the
quotation from Birchfield is interesting in relation to what he implies
rather than what he's explicitly stated

<ICE-SIN:S2B-046#22:1:A>
In my view there are at least three important implications in what
Birchfield has noted

<ICE-SIN:S2B-046#23:1:A>
Firstly Birchfield's decision to include the works of our greatest
modern writers indicates the evau the evaluative bent in his selection of
literary works

<ICE-SIN:S2B-046#24:1:A>
From which he collated his citations and touches on the important
question on whether the lexicographer should engage in a prior evaluation of
the standing of the author or of the quality of his or her literary works
before deciding to include quotations from the works in the dictionary
citation files

<ICE-SIN:S2B-046#25:1:A>
Although I initially wanted to disagree with Birchfield I have come
to the realization that this problem is unavoidable even today in 1980

<ICE-SIN:S2B-046#26:1:A>
For example noted that the conception of the good authors has come
to stay and cannot be neg neglected in any lexicographic file

<ICE-SIN:S2B-046#27:1:A>
This principle of selection may be especially important if the
language or variety of the language uh has a great number of literary works

<ICE-SIN:S2B-046#28:1:A>
This may not be the case with Singaporean literature as yet but
some kind of prior evaluation of the works may be necessary so that the
lexicographer is not inundated with data of ephemeral significance

<ICE-SIN:S2B-046#29:1:A>
Some highly regarded literary works may continue to be read many
years after their publication and the lexicographer has a duty to explain a
very high percentage of lexical items found in these works

<ICE-SIN:S2B-046#30:1:A>
In this relation of a member of the lexicographic team has some
prior training in literature and is capable of arriving at an evaluative
decision of works to include or exclude

<ICE-SIN:S2B-046#31:1:A>
In looking for data for the dictionary lexicographic files this
principle of selection may be crucial if the lexicographic project one
undertakes has a limited scope

<ICE-SIN:S2B-046#32:1:A>
Secondly Birchfield's decision to include the works of our greatest
modern writers indicates the restriction to economical works from the British
Isles

<ICE-SIN:S2B-046#33:1:A>
Which reveals that even a premier dictionary of English language
such as the OED has has its cheap interest the desire to keep a written
record of language and culture which centre on the British Isles

<ICE-SIN:S2B-046#34:1:A>
But there are bound to be less the thus there are bound to be less
citations from literary works by American writers when compared to citations
from British and Irish authors except for an author like TS Eliot who lived
in Britain for a good part of his life

<ICE-SIN:S2B-046#35:1:A>
And one suspects that there are even less citations from authors
writing in English from other countries of the British Commonwealth when
compared to those from bri British and Irish authors

<ICE-SIN:S2B-046#36:1:A>
This revelation by Birchfield makes the decision to embark on a
dictionary of other varieties of English uh apart from British Standard
English including a dictionary of Singaporean English even more urgent as the
OED and its supplements can never give us a fair picture of English as it is
spoken or in this case as it is written outside the British Isles

<ICE-SIN:S2B-046#37:1:A>
Thirdly the decision to include even Dylon Thomas and James Joyce
when the important exclusion of much of Heeningan's wake touches on the
extent or limit of the exclusion or otherwise of the creative use of the
English language and lexicography

<ICE-SIN:S2B-046#38:1:A>
The creative use of English may include nonce words or formations
which appear only in certain literary works and virtually no where else

<ICE-SIN:S2B-046#39:1:A>
In this connection some of the neologisms created in the heyday of
Ying Mao Chin for instance may have to be excluded as they probably do not
appear elsewhere in Singaporean English

<ICE-SIN:S2B-046#40:1:A>
But literary works may have an influence on the language people use
and some nonce forma formations especially in popular literary works may
eventually find their way to everyday language

<ICE-SIN:S2B-046#41:1:A>
For example the word taximan can in Catherine uh Catherine Lim's
The Taximan's Story

<ICE-SIN:S2B-046#42:1:A>
I suspect would be less likely to be included as part of the
Singaporean English lexicon had Lim's story not been published as the lexical
item taxi driver or the word taxi as a sus substitute for taxi driver were
definitely more common

<ICE-SIN:S2B-046#43:1:A>
On the other hand Arthur Yap's use of the verb intercept as a noun
in his poem Banyan Tree and conversion of the noun drought into an adjective
by adding the ed suffix as in droughted traveller in his poem The Meeting are
more likely to be nonce formations not found elsewhere in Singapore English

<ICE-SIN:S2B-046#44:1:A>
One major reason for the inclusion of citations from literary works
in the lexicographer's citation files is the fact that many literary works
that needs traditionally and as we know them today are examples of or as in
the case of poetry and drama have a permanent manifestation in written
language

<ICE-SIN:S2B-046#45:1:A>
The fact remains that the main source of data in lexicography is
still the written

<ICE-SIN:S2B-046#46:1:A>
In the words of the lexicographer Sidney Landow dictionaries are
not based on spoken language

<ICE-SIN:S2B-046#47:1:A>
There are preeminently records of the written language

<ICE-SIN:S2B-046#48:1:A>
The situation today has not changed much

<ICE-SIN:S2B-046#49:1:A>
In 1986 for example Benson and noted that the best dictionary
houses has citation banks for written English but are just beginning to use
spoken citations as lexicographic evidence

<ICE-SIN:S2B-046#50:1:A>
There has been criticism amongst linguists or more specifically
linguists with an interest in lexicography on the practice of including
mainly citations from writ written language when when collating lexicographic
data

<ICE-SIN:S2B-046#51:1:A>
We have seen Jo Foley for example criticising this pro procedure on
the first day of this workshop

<ICE-SIN:S2B-046#52:1:A>
But as Susan Butler and other lexicographers have pointed out the
collation of data from written language has an enormous practical advantage
over those from spoken language while not denying the importance of data from
spoken language

<ICE-SIN:S2B-046#53:1:A>
Especially when time and generous funds are available

<ICE-SIN:S2B-046#54:1:A>
Citations from written language are not only easier but also
cheaper to collate

<ICE-SIN:S2B-046#55:1:A>
It may be countered that the dependence on written language may be
applicable only to the main native varieties of English

<ICE-SIN:S2B-046#56:1:A>
But the Caribbean English dictionary which is a dictionary of a
non-native variety of English was according to Gustav planned to be based
mostly on printed texts and quotations from such texts

<ICE-SIN:S2B-046#57:1:A>
Written texts also have the advantage of giving the lexicographic
information from in terms of virtual stem of having arrived

<ICE-SIN:S2B-046#58:1:A>
As far as the language or dialect is concerned both practically and
psychologically spoken words seem to hang in the air so to speak

<ICE-SIN:S2B-046#59:1:A>
Whereas written words have a sense of permanence about them

<ICE-SIN:S2B-046#60:1:A>
This sense of permanency is even stronger when we are dealing with
literary works

<ICE-SIN:S2B-046#61:1:A>
Especially with works which are highly regarded as they are unlike
newspapers or magazines which are hardly read a few months after their
publication

<ICE-SIN:S2B-046#62:1:A>
Thus Birchfield's desire to include the vocabulary of our greatest
modern writers is not merely an insupportable preconceived value judgement
but has a practical value in giving the lexicographer an idea of lexico items
which have premanance or durability in relation to a language or dialect as
highly regarded literary works are read several years after their publication

<ICE-SIN:S2B-046#63:1:A>
Although it must be added here that we cannot say for certain at
present which works of Singaporean English literature will be read fifty
years from now

<ICE-SIN:S2B-046#64:1:A>
Or whether a canon of Singaporean literature in English which will
ensure the survival of some works is being developed or institutionalized
associated with the feeling of having arrived

<ICE-SIN:S2B-046#65:1:A>
In relation to uh to the written language is the fact that written
language gives the lexicographer an indication of how words are spelt

<ICE-SIN:S2B-046#66:1:A>
The problem of spelling colloquial le lexical items which have not
been written down has incidentally touched on by Rosemary Khoo in her talk
yesterday

<ICE-SIN:S2B-046#67:1:A>
In relation to this we must mention here that it is likely that
colloquial lexical items which have not been written down will make their
first printed appearance in the literary work

<ICE-SIN:S2B-046#68:1:A>
And thus the use of literary works in lexicography will make the
task of including these lexical items in the dictionary easier

<ICE-SIN:S2B-046#69:1:A>
The lexicographer who insists on including lexical items which have
not been written down may have to resort to the International Phonetic
Alphabet or some such phonetic alphabet

<ICE-SIN:S2B-046#70:1:A>
And he or she may have to resort to this means as the only means of
spelling of the dictionary's main entries

<ICE-SIN:S2B-046#71:1:A>
A practice which is quite odd to say the least or the lexical uh
lexicographer could do something worse than this

<ICE-SIN:S2B-046#72:1:A>
He or she could invent the spelling of these words using the
letters of the Romanized English alphabet even if these words have not
appeared before

<ICE-SIN:S2B-046#73:1:A>
In a language like English or its varieties and dialects this may
not be viable as English spellings not phonetically based

<ICE-SIN:S2B-046#74:1:A>
The appearance of colloquial words in the written form in literary
works would thus be of immense help in giving the lexicographer an indication
of how these words are spelt or the actual uses of the language or dialect

<ICE-SIN:S2B-046#75:1:A>
We may also note that Singaporean literature and English has the
advantage of being a living literature with a growing number of works

<ICE-SIN:S2B-046#76:1:A>
This gives the lexicographer more data to work on than a dialect
which does not have a written literature <X>

<ICE-SIN:S2B-046#X77:1:A>
Some Singaporean literary works in English are also quite popular
over the years some local collections of short stories such as Catherine
Lim's Little Ironies and Philip Jeyaretnam's First Love had 5 figure sales
and in the recently concluded annual festival books for examples some of the
recently published local literary books sold a few hundred copies per day
according to the figures released by the festival organisers in fact some of
the books such as Rex Shelley's Shrimp People and Gopal Baratham's Sayang
have sold 4000 copies each during the the exhibition and these two books in
fact deserve more than just a passing lexicographical mention as Shelley's
Shrimp People has a useful glossary of lo local lexical items at the end of
the book and Gopal Ba uh Gopal Baratham with his book hoped that the word
sayang will not only be part of Singaporean English which uh many of you
agreed yesterday is uh it is already a part of but uh of international
English as well this is a hope inciden inci incidentally which is uh uh
perhaps shared by Shirley Hew uh just now uh due to their popularity local
literary works may not only be a reflector of the English used by
Singaporeans but may possibly have an influence on the use of the language in
Singapore a factor which I mention earlier in relation to Catherine Lim's The
Taximan's Story in spite of their advantages literary works may also present
problems to the lexicographer these problems however may not be universal
lexicographic problems per se as I mean as as I can see it of course when it
comes to lexicography I am just a layman or universal problems one encounters
whenever one uses data from literary works but I suspect these are
theoretical and practical problems which may be either created or solved by
the kind of lexicographic work that one wants to compile and I think this has
been emphasised by Susan Butler just now and the time of information that one
wants to include in it they there may also be problems in relation to the
nature of language in general and the language or dialect that one is dealing
with in particular the kind of dictionary that one deals with may hinge on
whether one wants to include an encyclopedic information this inci
incidentally has been mentioned by Dr Ban in his opening address it has been
discussed uh yesterday by the workshop participants and whether the lexical
items should be arranged conceptually as in uh thesaurus and not merely
alphabetically the kind of dictionary that one deals with may also hinge on
the extent of the dictionaries thoroughness exhaustiveness or scope and on
its uh intended readership and I think this is the precise point made by
Susan Butler just now the pre the predetermined scope of the dictionary may
determine for instance whether citations from literary works or citations in
general should be included or excluded if they're included then they become
rather scholarly like the OED or Websters intend international version in
this connection I have also mentioned earlier that the prior evaluation of
literary works may be crucial for dealing with a dictionary of a limited
scope I would be dealing with the potential user of the dictionary of
Singaporean English in relations to Singaporean literature later in my talk
but we may mention here that the intended readership of the dictionary may be
a highly specialised one in this regard the dictionary of English as it is
used in Singaporean English literature or more general dictionary of
Singaporean English as it is as it is found in the literature it's an
academic likelihood which may possibly be re be realised in the not so
distant future the type of information to be put in the dictionary which in
turn has been predetermined by the scope of the dictionary may centre on the
question of whether one should include information on collocation grammar
slang and so on one may also consider whether to indicate if the lexical item
belongs to standard or non standard Singaporean English usage or whether
there is a regional variation on the lexical items used that one should
decide whether to include information on regional variation may seem bizarre
at first sight but uh uh uh most of you have uh attended some of the earlier
sessions and you know that this is uh uh a problem which uh anyone dealing
with uh uh Singaporean lexical items face the primary difficulty here of
course is uh the distinction between English as it is spoken in Singapore and
English as it as it is spoken in Malaysia uh and in fact this problem is in
fact compounded and not helped by the fact that Singaporean literature in
English and Malaysian literature in English are quite often taken especially
in the past as one literature and not as two separate literatures for example
Edwin Thumboo's three collections of poetry the Flowering Tree Seven Poets
and the Second Tongue publishes respectively in 1970 73 and 76 or include
poets writing in English from both Malaysia and Singapore in spite of the
fact that all three volumes were published after Singapore's separation from
Malaysia even today the general commonwealth literature still discusses
Singaporean and Malaysian literatures together in its annual review studies
of the literatures of the two countries I suspect that the lexicographer of
Singaporean English cannot simply ignore the earlier works in English by
Malaysian writers such as Mohamed Haji Salim Lord Llyod Frenando as there did
not seem to be a sharp division between both the literatures in English and
the English dialects of the two countries until recent years I myself picked
an example from the poem by Mohamed Haji Saleh earlier in my talk in order to
determine the possibility of his inclusion in the Singaporean English lexicon
however certain lexical items may mainly occur in Malaysian English and not
in Singaporean English such lexical items should be labelled strictly as
Malaysian as has been suggested I think yesterday in this workshop and not
simply excluded especially when one is dealing with a dictionary which has a
wide scope as one cannot entirely preclude the possibility of the occurrence
in the English spoken by Singaporeans one possible solution to the
Singapore-Malaysia problem as has been sug suggested by Susan Butler and also
by I think uh Anthea Gupta is to have a dictionary of both Singaporean and
Malaysian English in one volume another linguistic factor which may prove
either to be a help or hindrance to the lexicographer oif Singaporean English
using Singaporean literary works in English is the codification of the
standard language as far as Singaporean English as a non-native variety is
concerned now many of the workshop participants have discussed this and many
of them agree that the standard for language or variety of the language goes
hand in hand with a dictionary of the language or variety </X> </I>
