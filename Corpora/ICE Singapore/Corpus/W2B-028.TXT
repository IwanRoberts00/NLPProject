<h> The Boas and Pythons </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-028#4:1>
<h> Family Boidae </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-028#5:1>
There are altogether about 70 species of boas and pythons found in the
world and they all belong to the family Boidae.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-028#6:1>
Boas and pythons share some characteristics.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-028#7:1>
Both are constrictors and most possess vestiges of the third limbs
which are usually present as claws or spurs on either side of the vent or
cloaca.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-028#8:1>
They also have two lungs, though the left lung is smaller and may be
greatly diminished in the more primitive kinds of boas.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-028#9:1>
Here the resemblance ends, for boas belong to the sub-family Boinae
and range from 60 cm upwards in length.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-028#10:1>
These snakes generally give birth to live young ( ie they are
viviparous) or they lay eggs which hatch almost immediately, a condition
known as ovo-viviparity.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-028#11:1>
Most boa species are found in the New World, though there is an
overlapping of the geographical distribution in Africa and the Indian
subcontinent with the pythons.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-028#12:1>
The Asian boas prefer arid sandy areas as they lead a
semi-subterranean way of life.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-028#13:1>
The pythons, on the other hand, belong to the sub-family Pythoninae.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-028#14:1>
They are generally snakes of massive proportions and great lengths
and are hence well known in this part of the world.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-028#15:1>
Unlike boas, pythons have heat-detecting pits along the lips of
their mouths, are egg-layers and occur principally in the Old World of Asia
and Australasia.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-028#16:1>
Humid forests and well-watered areas are the preferred habitats of
the pythons.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-028#17:1>
There are about 20 species and sub-species of pythons occurring in
the Asia-Pacific region, and the largest of them is the reticulated python (
Python reticulatus) which can attain an impressive length of about 10 metres
or so.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-028#18:1>
This common and handsome snake is remarkably adaptable and can be
found in the dense jungles, areas close to water and even near human
settlements.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-028#19:1>
Being a good swimmer, the reticulated python also colonises numerous
off-shore islands.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-028#20:1>
Though the reticulated python produces only a single clutch annually,
the number of eggs deposited can be anywhere between 16 to 103.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-028#21:1>
The precious clutch is coiled around and incubated by the female,
whose presence effectively discourages common egg-raiders like civet cats and
monitor lizards.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-028#22:1>
Young pythons often frequent areas near human settlements where they
prey on mice and rats, and hence can be regarded as beneficial for they keep
the population of such vermin in check.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-028#23:1>
Larger reticulated pythons, however, tend to undo the good deed
occasionally raiding the rural farms, taking fowls, piglets and even dogs and
cats.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-028#24:1>
As a consequence pythons of all sizes end up being captured by the
irate farmers and residents who sometimes donate the snakes to the zoo.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-028#25:1>
I received as many 20 reticulated pythons during a particularly "
productive" month.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-028#26:1>
One can usually link the probable cause of this undesirable change of
diet to the shrinking natural habitats of the snakes, with the resultant
scarcity of suitable natural prey.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-028#27:1>
On rare occasions, various forms of atypical reticulated pythons turn
up in the steady flow of python donations to the zoo over the years.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-028#28:1>
I was delighted one day when I opened a gunny-sack to find a
startling pale-coloured, wild-caught reticulated python, about 3 metres
long.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-028#29:1>
Even normal reticulated pythons may come in either one of the two
body colour phases: those pythons in the dark colour phase are
short-tempered, while those in the bright colour phase are invariably
selected by snake charmers and hobbyists because they are more easily
conditioned to handling.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-028#30:1>
The reticulated python occurs in Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand,
Indonesia, Burma, Indo-China and the Philippines.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-028#31:1>
It has charmed many who have come to know and understand it.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-028#32:1>
Its status in the wild seems secure for the regular field encounters
and captures indicate that it is still common.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-028#33:1>
But one may ask, how long?

<ICE-SIN:W2B-028#34:1>
Another colourful python found in this region is the blood python (
Python curtus).

<ICE-SIN:W2B-028#35:1>
This heavy and stout-bodied python reaches only about 3 metres in
length and it prefers humid habitats bordering waterways in the jungle where
it hunts for small mammals, particularly rats.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-028#36:1>
Captive blood pythons are notoriously known to be difficult feeders,
but with patience and proper conditioning, one can induce some individuals to
accept live chicks, gerbils and hamsters.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-028#37:1>
I have recorded several matings in a well-established pair in the
zoo, the copulations usually occurring in the early morning in the early and
later part of the year.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-028#38:1>
Recently, they were observed mating in mid-May and it is hoped that
the female will at last produce a clutch of eggs soon.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-028#39:1>
The blood python is found in Malaysia, Indonesia, Borneo and Indo-
China.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-028#40:1>
My favourite in the python family is the rock python, of which there
are two recognised sub-species.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-028#41:1>
The larger Burmese rock python ( Python molurus bivittatus) which can
grow to over 7 metres, is found in East Java, Burma, Indo-China, Southern
China and Hong Kong.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-028#42:1>
The rarer Indian rock python ( Python molurus molurus) occurs only in
Pakistan, India and Sri Lanka.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-028#43:1>
Both of these sub-species of rock pythons, when collected young, are
easily tamed and hence highly popular with snake keepers, charmers and
hobbyists.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-028#44:1>
These snakes adapt well to captivity and are easily maintained on a
diet of chicks, hens, rats and hamsters.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-028#45:1>
Atypical rock pythons are quite rare and hence highly valued as
exhibits and breeding specimens.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-028#46:1>
I have known people who have willingly paid a princely sum of about
Singapore
&dollar;78,000 for a pair of atypical golden-white Burmese rock pythons.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-028#47:1>
Towards the eastern part of this region can be found about a dozen or
so kinds of pythons belonging to various genera, most of them occurring in
the Australian continent and parts of New Guinea.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-028#48:1>
One of them, the green tree python ( Chondropython virldis) is
specially adapted for an arboreal existence with its greatly enlarged front
teeth, strongly prehensile tail and a long slim body.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-028#49:1>
Unlike the Amazonian tree boa ( Corallus caninus) to which it bears
striking resemblance in both physical and resting posture, the green tree
python is an egg-layer, producing up to 20 eggs in a clutch.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-028#50:1>
The baby tree pythons are brick red with white vertebral markings,
becoming yellow and then green as they mature.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-028#51:1>
Wild birds and small mammals are its natural prey, but in captivity,
the green tree python can be induced to accept mice, chicks, gerbils and
hamsters.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-028#52:1>
The green tree python averages about 90 cm but may reach a maximum
length of about 2 metres.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-028#53:1>
It occurs in the forested parts of Northern Australia and New Guinea.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-028#54:1>
Another rare python which also occurs in New Guinea is the largely
terrestrial and nocturnal white-lipped python ( Liasis albertisi).

<ICE-SIN:W2B-028#55:1>
It is so called because its blackish head is marked along the lips
with white and black bars.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-028#56:1>
Its 2-metre-long body is characteristically cylindrical and covered
with smooth small scales which tend to give the python a beaded appearance.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-028#57:1>
The two adult white-lipped pythons which I encountered were hostile
and kept striking the glass front of their tanks repeatedly at the slightest
sign of disturbance.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-028#58:1>
The white-lipped python lays eggs and feeds on warm-blooded animals -
in captivity it will feed on chicks and hamsters.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-028#59:1>
There are about 7 species of sand boas in the Old World, being
distributed from the Middle East to Northern Africa, eastwards to the Indian
sub-continent and Northwest China.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-028#60:1>
The sand boa, as its name implies, inhabits dry sandy areas where it
often spends much of the time buried in the loose soil or sand, usually with
only its head showing as it lies in wait for any passing unsuspecting prey
like rodents and birds.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-028#61:1>
At dusk, the sand boa comes onto the surface.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-028#62:1>
Its slit-like valvular nostrils ( to exclude sand) and enlarged
tougll scale on the snout ( to aid in tunnelling) are special adaptations for
a burrowing way of life.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-028#63:1>
The head of the sand boa is covered with numerous small scales like
the body.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-028#64:1>
However, several longitudinal rows of scales along the back to the
tail are keeled ( see Figs 1a and 1b) and rough to the touch.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-028#65:1>
The eyes are small with slit-like pupils.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-028#66:1>
The Russell's sand boa ( Eryx coicus) is attractively marked and
grows to between 49-90 cm long.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-028#67:1>
It occurs in West Pakistan, all over India and Sri Lanka.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-028#68:1>
I have found this species to possess an unpredictable disposition -
it may suddenly attack by lunging in a series of rapid sidelong slashes at
one's hand, inflicting bleeding wounds.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-028#69:1>
In captivity, it feeds on mice and day-old chicks.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-028#70:1>
About 16 young are born in a litter, usually in the months of June
and July.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-028#71:1>
Another interesting sand boa is the brown sand boa ( Eryx johni).

<ICE-SIN:W2B-028#72:1>
Sometimes also known as John's sand boa, it is uniformly dark brown
with a very blunt tail that resembles the head.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-028#73:1>
When molested, it often assumes a defensive position with the tail
sticking out of the body coils, thereby deceiving the enemy into thinking
that it is the head.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-028#74:1>
The reproduction and feeding habits of the brown sand boa are similar
to that of the Russell's sand boa.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-028#75:1>
Juvenile brown sand boas are lighter brown in colour, becoming darker
as they mature.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-028#76:1>
They can reach a length of about l metre and are distributed
throughout the Indian sub-continent.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-028#77:1>
There exists a small but unique group of Boid snakes in the Solomon
Islands in the South Pacific.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-028#78:1>
These snakes belong to the genus Candoia.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-028#79:1>
Like the sand boas, they give birth to live young and possess
vestiges of the hind limbs.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-028#80:1>
All the Solomon boas have the snout obliquely truncated, and the body
scales keeled.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-028#81:1>
Of the three Solomon Island species, two are described here.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-028#82:1>
The common tree boa ( Candoia carinata) can grow to about 1 metre,
but the average length is around 75 cm.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-028#83:1>
It is the most widespread of the Soloman Island boas, and occurs in
the forests, rocky and grassy areas, caves and cultivated areas.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-028#84:1>
The body coloration is very variable - being from light cream to
brown, brick red to dark brown with a darker zig-zag vertebral pattern.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-028#85:1>
The cryptic colouration helps conceal it on open ground among leaves
and grass.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-028#86:1>
Up to 20 young are born in a litter.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-028#87:1>
In captivity, it takes readily to white mice, and can be handled
quite uneventfully if one is gentle enough with it.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-028#88:1>
Another species, the greater tree boa ( Candoia bibroni) is the
largest of the three species of Solomon Island boas, capable of reaching
lengths of between 1.25 to 2 metres.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-028#89:1>
The body coloration is also quite variable, being dark grey or
blackish with darker blotches forming a variegated pattern, this being very
distinct on the posterior body and on the tail.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-028#90:1>
Unlike the former species it is largely arboreal, occurring in
mangrove swamps, forests and even cultivated areas.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-028#91:1>
The greater tree boa hunts at night for small prey like lizards,
rats, flying foxes and other birds.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-028#92:1>
In captivity, I have found this snake to be easily manageable, taking
readily to white mice and day-old chicks.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-028#93:1>
<h> The Blind Snakes </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-028#94:1>
<h> Family Typhlopidae </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-028#95:1>
This family of blind snakes comprises nearly 200 species which has
such a wide pantropical distribution that it can also be found on some of the
remote Pacific islands.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-028#96:1>
The blind snakes are generally soil burrowers, being small and
worm-like in appearance.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-028#97:1>
They have specialised habits, with teeth only in the upper jaws and
they feed on soft-bodied insects and their eggs and grubs.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-028#98:1>
Most species reproduce by laying eggs, the clutch size varying with
different species.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-028#99:1>
Among the larger of the blind snakes found in this region is the
Diard's blind snake ( Typhlops diardi).

<ICE-SIN:W2B-028#100:1>
Several sub-species are known, found in Malaysia, Singapore,
Thailand, Burma and Indochina.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-028#101:1>
In some parts of its range the Djard's blind snake is said to lay
eggs ( ie to be oviparous) whereas in others, it is reported to be
viviparous.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-028#102:1>
It grows to about 30-48 cm long and spends most of its time
underground, occasionally coming onto the surface at dusk.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-028#103:1>
I have collected specimens which had accidentally fallen into
steep-sided drains and consequently could not climb out.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-028#104:1>
As its mouth is small and barely distensible, the blind snake feeds
on small prey like lizards and worms. <X>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-028#X105:1>
Another smaller but more common blind snake is the Brahminy blind
snake ( Ramphotyphlops braminus). </X> </I>
