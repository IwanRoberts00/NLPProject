Mrs Chua rang this morning

<ICE-SIN:S1A-024#46:1:A>
She's wondering whether she's invited to tonight's dinner and uhm I
told her that she was

<ICE-SIN:S1A-024#47:1:A>
Mrs Lim had taken for granted that she was going and there was no
need to send a special invitation to her

<ICE-SIN:S1A-024#48:1:A>
She said anyway she just came back from uh the Rockies

<ICE-SIN:S1A-024#49:1:A>
And she says that the weather there is warm not cool as we as we
thought it would be

<ICE-SIN:S1A-024#50:1:A>
And surprisingly she said the Rocky the <unclear> word </unclear>
where she stayed for two days was also warm

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-024#51:1:B>
Uhm

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-024#52:1:A>
So

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-024#53:1:B>
How long was she there in the Canada

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-024#54:1:A>
Fifteen days fifteen days with her two daughters and
son-in-law one son-in-law

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-024#55:1:B>
Uhm uhm

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-024#56:1:A>
And she said that uhm she enjoyed it very much

<ICE-SIN:S1A-024#57:1:A>
She says the scenery is one of the best and she she also mentioned
that she went up to the uh Summer Fraser University and the view from there
is excellent

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-024#58:1:B>
Uhm

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-024#59:1:A>
She says the architecture too is good but she doesn't think
that that building deserves first prize in the uhm something like
architectural uh competi competition

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-024#60:1:B>
Is it

<ICE-SIN:S1A-024#61:1:B>
When did they get first prize

<ICE-SIN:S1A-024#62:1:B>
I didn't know

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-024#63:1:A>
It seems there was some competition

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-024#64:1:B>
Uhm

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-024#65:1:A>
Of architectural designs and Summer Fraser University topped

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-024#66:1:B>
Oh that's that's very good what

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-024#67:1:A>
Uhm

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-024#68:1:B>
Huh

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-024#69:1:A>
Uhm

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-024#70:1:B>
Cos our children love that place very much Huh

<ICE-SIN:S1A-024#71:1:B>
Since they've been there for about four years

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-024#72:1:A>
She says the building is nice but not that wonderful

<ICE-SIN:S1A-024#73:1:A>
But the view is from there is excellent

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-024#74:1:B>
But I think the <unclear> word </unclear> building is unusual

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-024#75:1:A>
You know

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-024#76:1:B>
Because all these buildings are connected to one another and
there's no exposure to the rain and the sun

<ICE-SIN:S1A-024#77:1:B>
I think that was what <unclear> word </unclear> told us last time
wasn't it

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-024#78:1:A>
Ya it seems ya ya

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-024#79:1:B>
Uhm

<ICE-SIN:S1A-024#80:1:A>
Eh actually we should walk round the buildings

<ICE-SIN:S1A-024#81:1:A>
We have not walked

<ICE-SIN:S1A-024#82:1:A>
We have not even been into the main uh building itself

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-024#83:1:B>

<ICE-SIN:S1A-024#86:1:B>
Uhm

<ICE-SIN:S1A-024#87:1:A>

enclosed areas

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-024#112:1:B>
I think uh we should end by nine-thirty not uh

<ICE-SIN:S1A-024#113:1:B>
The latest should be ten but I don't think it will stretch as long
as ten o'clock

<ICE-SIN:S1A-024#114:1:B>
Would it

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-024#115:1:A>
Uhm

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-024#116:1:B>
So far we had the meetings ending only about nine thirty

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-024#117:1:A>
Oh ya ya

<ICE-SIN:S1A-024#118:1:A>

think that uh it's a little inconvenient for Victor uh Vin not Victor Vincent
to you know to keep them company till about ten

<ICE-SIN:S1A-024#119:1:A>
And also Vincent would be actually having dinner at her uhm's his
uhm's

<ICE-SIN:S1A-024#123:1:A>
So they they rang just now to ask me whether I could ask
Victor to allow them to use his computer

Uhm uhm

<ICE-SIN:S1A-024#125:1:B>
Have you asked Victor already

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-024#126:1:A>

<ICE-SIN:S1A-024#127:1:A>
I only spoke to Kathleen but then the we we had to cut short our
conversation because she had an incoming call at her office you know so

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-024#128:1:B>

I mean if he's unable to finish he says he'll carry on tomorrow
night

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-024#131:1:B>
Ya it's more convenient because uh after all they're only a
few doors away from here

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-024#132:1:A>
Ya

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-024#133:1:B>
Just a short distance

<ICE-SIN:S1A-024#134:1:B>
But Vincent's place is too far

<ICE-SIN:S1A-024#135:1:B>
It's Bishan and I think uh I don't think it'll be very convenient
for them to go a few times

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-024#136:1:A>
Ya

<ICE-SIN:S1A-024#137:1:A>

some Bee Hoon for tomorrow night's function

<ICE-SIN:S1A-024#146:1:A>
Uh I told her that I would just say 'yes' and if I can think of
another dish I'll do that dish

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-024#147:1:B>
But Bee Hoon would be very good <unclear> word </unclear> if
she can fry Bee Hoon

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-024#148:1:A>

<ICE-SIN:S1A-024#151:1:B>
Hemelia can cook the fish ball or the meat ball

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-024#152:1:A>
Uh meat ball ya

Uhm This morning I was listening to the tape I bought from
Malacca some years back Cantigas

<ICE-SIN:S1A-024#238:1:A>
Cantigas I think is Portuguese music Portuguese singing

Portuguese uh singing is very lively

<ICE-SIN:S1A-024#240:1:A>
Oh ya by the way uh Loonie rang up last night

<ICE-SIN:S1A-024#241:1:A>
Loonie I I'm not sure whether he rang from Singapore or from
Philippines

<ICE-SIN:S1A-024#242:1:A>
He didn't indicate that

<ICE-SIN:S1A-024#243:1:A>
But he rang

<ICE-SIN:S1A-024#244:1:A>
I don't I don't know why he rang also

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-024#252:1:B>
I think it should be at the Singapore

<ICE-SIN:S1A-024#253:1:B>
Let me see

<ICE-SIN:S1A-024#254:1:B>
Airlines Club what do you call it

<ICE-SIN:S1A-024#255:1:B>
SIA Club

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-024#256:1:A>
Uhm uhm

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-024#257:1:B>
SIA Club ya

<ICE-SIN:S1A-024#258:1:B>
Seems that anybody could go there eh for the dinner or for for the
meals

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-024#259:1:A>
It's different for our club

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-024#260:1:B>
Uhm

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-024#261:1:A>
Our club is so exclusive

<ICE-SIN:S1A-024#262:1:A>
I I I don't know the fact that they have to charge visitors who
come in for just for a meal

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-024#263:1:B>
Well they've got their reason I suppose otherwise there'll be
all sorts of all all sorts of people coming in

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-024#264:1:A>
Ya but if members uh members sign them in it's okay what

<ICE-SIN:S1A-024#265:1:A>
I mean shouldn't shouldn't uh make it that difficult for members
to have a guest for dinner or for lunch

<ICE-SIN:S1A-024#266:1:A>
Or of course lunch-time it's anybody can come in on work on
working days not on weekends nor public holidays but uhm working days they
allow that

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-024#267:1:B>
Uhm You see in Chinese Swimming Club they have a separate
entrance going to the restaurant so people use just use that entrance and
come out exactly in the same way

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-024#268:1:A>
Uhm

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-024#269:1:B>
Whereas in our club uh you have entrance going to the
swimming pool as well as to the billiards room as well as to uh you know the
other facilities rooms

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-024#270:1:A>
Anyway I don't like the Chinese Swimming Club <X>

<ICE-SIN:S1A-024#X271:1:A>
It's so much like a little uh uh uh a mini-China

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-024#X272:1:B>
Uhm

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-024#X273:1:A>
The colour is blue and the new uh pool with its building has
got such uh poor taste The archi architecture is such

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-024#X274:1:B>
It's Chinese what That's

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-024#X275:1:A>
The architecture is so bad

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-024#X276:1:B>
I mean that's typical Chinese what <unclear> word </unclear>

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-024#X277:1:A>
I I don't know I feel as thouh I'm in China when I see
<unclear> word </unclear> look at that building I'm in that in that ang in
that space there

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-024#X278:1:B>
Ya uhm What we don't really appreciate is enclosed feeling
that we get when we go there whereas we

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-024#X279:1:A>
It's so different from our from the Changi Beach Club

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-024#X280:1:B>
Uhm uhm

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-024#X281:1:A>
where you have the sea right in front of you and the breeze

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-024#X282:1:B>
