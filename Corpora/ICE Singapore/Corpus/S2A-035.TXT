<ICE-SIN:S2A-035#1:1:A>
We had a special viewing session in the museum last night for
some very special people

<ICE-SIN:S2A-035#2:1:A>
So they were going through the whole of museum from one room to
another gallery and so on

<ICE-SIN:S2A-035#3:1:A>
And at the end of this whole tour there was going to be a reception
for them in the conference room

<ICE-SIN:S2A-035#4:1:A>
There will be drinks there will be cakes and so on

<ICE-SIN:S2A-035#5:1:A>
So there was this show known as Mo Tau the Ink Paintings in
Singapore that was right before the conference room

<ICE-SIN:S2A-035#6:1:A>
After walking through the whole museum the whole group just went
past the whole exhibition just because there was food at the end of it

<ICE-SIN:S2A-035#7:1:A>
And that's quite natural and your lunch time is like uh what
thirty-five minutes from now and you must be happy

<ICE-SIN:S2A-035#8:1:A>
So we should keep to just thirty-five minutes and uh hopefully you
know we can uh go through with

<ICE-SIN:S2A-035#9:1:A>
And I'm interested in having a dialogue discussion with you more
than anything else because I understand that you're a group of writers are
you not

<ICE-SIN:S2A-035#10:1:A>
And I do not know how much you're interested in art

<ICE-SIN:S2A-035#11:1:A>
I was saying I do not know how much are you all are interested in
art

<ICE-SIN:S2A-035#12:1:A>
Uh I certainly hope to use this use this very short uh session that
I have with you to talk about at what points we can cross-reference art
history and literal history and what kind of inspirations that you know

<ICE-SIN:S2A-035#13:1:A>
Again art could draw from writing and writing could draw from the
visual arts

<ICE-SIN:S2A-035#14:1:A>
Uh the talk that I'm going to have is called Art And Identity: Ink
Painting In Singapore

<ICE-SIN:S2A-035#15:1:A>
I gave this title over a long-distance phone call and somebody
decided to be creative along the way and to add the word creative which makes
no identity

<ICE-SIN:S2A-035#16:1:A>
But it is art and identity and not necessarily a creative identity

<ICE-SIN:S2A-035#17:1:A>
Uhm the the point is uh I'm I'm giving this talk in conjunction
with the current exhibition that we have at the National Museum the one that
I mention Mo Tau uh Ink Paintings in Singapore

<ICE-SIN:S2A-035#18:1:A>
Uhm uh ink paintings or you all might better know the medium as
Chinese paintings then again whether these paintings are Chinese is a point
of contention

<ICE-SIN:S2A-035#19:1:A>
You know this is precisely some of the things that we could discuss
about

<ICE-SIN:S2A-035#20:1:A>
Uh it is better to use the more technical term ink painting as in
as in the ink medium

<ICE-SIN:S2A-035#21:1:A>
Uh the exhibition that we are having tries to capture to talk about
in particular history in particular development of this medium of paintings
in Singapore over the past fourteen years or so

<ICE-SIN:S2A-035#22:1:A>
The actually I'm keen to find out are you all interested in art at
this pace

<ICE-SIN:S2A-035#23:1:A>
Do do you all like paintings

<ICE-SIN:S2A-035#24:1:A>
Yes no no sorry uh okay okay okay

<ICE-SIN:S2A-035#25:1:A>
Okay uh we may say that the beginning of art in Singapore I mean we
do this for reasons of writing an art history of Singapore as the point when
Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts was establish in 1938

<ICE-SIN:S2A-035#26:1:A>
Have you heard of Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts which is a art
school well-known art school uh very established art school in Singapore

<ICE-SIN:S2A-035#27:1:A>
Now this school was established in 1938

<ICE-SIN:S2A-035#28:1:A>
And when the school was established it was modelled after similar
art academies in Shanghai in China Shanghai was then the arts centre of Shang
uh of of China in the 1950s

<ICE-SIN:S2A-035#29:1:A>
Now if you go back further back into Chinese uh history twentieth
century history uh you'll you'll you'll recall that you know early twentieth
century late nineteenth century was the point when the Chinese learned along
from the West

<ICE-SIN:S2A-035#30:1:A>
And they got this a lot of Western technology Western ideas and so
on and try to integrate this Western uh technologies and idea with Chinese
tradition

<ICE-SIN:S2A-035#31:1:A>
So when the art academies were establish in Shanghai in the
twenties and thirties they had uh basically two departments

<ICE-SIN:S2A-035#32:1:A>
One is known as Chinese ink painting the other one is xiyang hua or
Western art

<ICE-SIN:S2A-035#33:1:A>
And the two departments could never really integrate because to
begin with we're talking about very different uhm uh artistic uhm uh
traditions at artistic or aesthetic traditions

<ICE-SIN:S2A-035#34:1:A>
And same as for Singapore when it came to Singapore

<ICE-SIN:S2A-035#35:1:A>
When this moder of art academy came to Singapore in the late 1930s
Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts also started with two departments The Chinese
painting department the Western painting department

<ICE-SIN:S2A-035#36:1:A>
Even up to today you know this uh dichotomy is still very
problematical

<ICE-SIN:S2A-035#37:1:A>
Now in this exhibition we're organising we try to look at the
history of Singapore art just plan from the view of a single medium ink
painting

<ICE-SIN:S2A-035#38:1:A>
And uh in doing so we try to see how by looking from this point of
view by looking specifically from this perspective what kind of questions we
can generate

<ICE-SIN:S2A-035#39:1:A>
What kind of issues

<ICE-SIN:S2A-035#40:1:A>
What kind of discussions we can generate in discuss in talking
about the history of art in Singapore

<ICE-SIN:S2A-035#41:1:A>
So uh have the Nanyang style

<ICE-SIN:S2A-035#42:1:A>
Have you heard of this term

<ICE-SIN:S2A-035#43:1:A>
Uh do some of you do art major are are you doing art as a paper in
your 'A' level

<ICE-SIN:S2A-035#44:1:A>
You are just writers and nothing else

<ICE-SIN:S2A-035#45:1:A>
Okay okay uh okay let me see how I should say this

<ICE-SIN:S2A-035#46:1:A>
There was a group of artists in the early 1950s uh namely uh Chen
Wenxi Zong Sutien uh Cheng chon Cheng Chong Swee and Liu Kan who went for a
field trip in Bali in 1952 uh specifically

<ICE-SIN:S2A-035#47:1:A>
So during this trip they captured many of the Balinese sceneries
Balinese culture people and so on

<ICE-SIN:S2A-035#48:1:A>
And this field trip that they made in the in 1950 uh in the early
1950s when they came back they actually uh a new genre of painting known as
Nanyang style

<ICE-SIN:S2A-035#49:1:A>
Basically they integrated Chinese ink with Western methods of ink
painting and using Balinese subject matters

<ICE-SIN:S2A-035#50:1:A>
In the 70s and 80s when we started talking looking at our own art
history when Singapore started looking started looking our own art history we
then identified the Nanyang style of the 1950s as our first art movement

<ICE-SIN:S2A-035#51:1:A>
So you know this is a fairly nationalistic uh retrospective of our
own art history and we were searching for an art movement that we could call
our own

<ICE-SIN:S2A-035#52:1:A>
Is like the Americans calling the abstract expressionism as the
American the beginning of American art you know

<ICE-SIN:S2A-035#53:1:A>
America finally became independent culturally from their European
counterparts and started its own uh artistic movement

<ICE-SIN:S2A-035#54:1:A>
So same as for Singapore in the seventies and eighties we started
considering Nanyang style as our own

<ICE-SIN:S2A-035#55:1:A>
At the same time uh new arty younger artist who studied at Nanyang
Academy of Fine Arts in the late sixties in the early seventies and so on
started doing their fine arts studies abroad

<ICE-SIN:S2A-035#56:1:A>
So some went to London some went to New York and so on uh others
went to Paris

<ICE-SIN:S2A-035#57:1:A>
So when they came back they brought uh brought back with them many
new ideas especially about uh abstract expressionism internationalist
artistic directions

<ICE-SIN:S2A-035#58:1:A>
So in the seventies and eighties the whole discussion of visual
arts in Singapore was very much uh uh at two ends of the spectum

<ICE-SIN:S2A-035#59:1:A>
On the one hand you have the nationalistic approach to look at
Nanyang style as in the art movement in Singapore

<ICE-SIN:S2A-035#60:1:A>
And on the other hand you you have the internationalist approach to
look at international trend from America and so on as a international art
style which we should have

<ICE-SIN:S2A-035#61:1:A>
The ink painters in the meantime you know this this group of people
continued to paint paint in the traditional ink media

<ICE-SIN:S2A-035#62:1:A>
Now even the word traditional is questionable because some of them
actually evolve you know from the traditional approach to ink to to be more
innovative and to do new things and so on

<ICE-SIN:S2A-035#63:1:A>
Uh they found themselves being caught in in a awkward position
because they were not internationalist uh painters in the sense of doing
abstract art

<ICE-SIN:S2A-035#64:1:A>
And they were also not nationalist painters in the sense of doing??
Nanyang style art

<ICE-SIN:S2A-035#65:1:A>
They were traditionalist painters yes uh by association of the ink
medium regurgitation of Chinese painting

<ICE-SIN:S2A-035#66:1:A>
However because Singapore continued uh to have exchanges with China
after the end of cultural revolution in China

<ICE-SIN:S2A-035#67:1:A>
So many Chinese artist from mainland China came to Singapore they
sold their works in Singapore

<ICE-SIN:S2A-035#68:1:A>
And many buyers of art in Singapore collectors by virtue of this
artist coming from mainland China

<ICE-SIN:S2A-035#69:1:A>
They were taught to be more Chinese or more uh authentic than the
local ink painters

<ICE-SIN:S2A-035#70:1:A>
So it was a period for them it was a very low key period because
they were neither here nor there

<ICE-SIN:S2A-035#71:1:A>
You know they could not find themselves uh a niche in the
nationalist uh paradigm they could find themselves in position in the
internationally uh outlook

<ICE-SIN:S2A-035#72:1:A>
Uh they could not find themselves even a position in the
traditionalist approach to art

<ICE-SIN:S2A-035#73:1:A>
So this is when National Museum uh our task at the museum is always
to research to interpret present the art history of Singapore

<ICE-SIN:S2A-035#74:1:A>
Not in any simplistic manner but always we try to show the picture
as complex as we can in order to be as true to the actual development as we
can

<ICE-SIN:S2A-035#75:1:A>
And hence we put together this exhibition to show that uh in any
development of visual arts and I'm sure it should be the same for writing for
the literaly history

<ICE-SIN:S2A-035#76:1:A>
Uh we have to be very careful about using any simplistic uh
schematisation of looking at the developments

<ICE-SIN:S2A-035#77:1:A>
But we always have to see the actual reality of a very complex
picture of a very diverse picture of development

<ICE-SIN:S2A-035#78:1:A>
Uhm now I'm just going to talk a little bit about identity because
the development of Singapore art has a lot to do with the identity of
Singaporean Chinese

<ICE-SIN:S2A-035#79:1:A>
Now I'm not saying that the museum is only interested in Chinese
art of course

<ICE-SIN:S2A-035#80:1:A>
But we happen to be dealing with this topic as this point

<ICE-SIN:S2A-035#81:1:A>
And you know we are also interested for instant uh next year we are
having an exhibition on Indonesian art and so on

<ICE-SIN:S2A-035#82:1:A>
So we're always interested in looking at things from other ethnic
groups' point of a view

<ICE-SIN:S2A-035#83:1:A>
When a why you know the question here is

<ICE-SIN:S2A-035#84:1:A>
Why is Chen Wenxi Chong Cheng Chong Swee uh Chen Suying and Liu Kan
go to Bali in the early fifties and why did they start a Nanyang style

<ICE-SIN:S2A-035#85:1:A>
Uh we argue in the current exhibition that one way of looking at
this is to go back again to China to Shanghai in the 1920s and 30s

<ICE-SIN:S2A-035#86:1:A>
Because after the May fourth uh movement in Shan in China uh what
was really introduced to the visual arts education in China was Western
representational painting or naturalistic painting or or representation

<ICE-SIN:S2A-035#87:1:A>
Sorry I mean or uh realist painting

<ICE-SIN:S2A-035#88:1:A>
At the point when you know of course uh this was a period of
judaism it was it was a period of phobism?? and so on

<ICE-SIN:S2A-035#89:1:A>
When when the West began to be more interested in abstract
paintings

<ICE-SIN:S2A-035#90:1:A>
But what the Chinese learn from the West they were really more
interested in realism for very specific historical reasons

<ICE-SIN:S2A-035#91:1:A>
Because artist were intellectuals and they wanted to communicate
with the public at large

<ICE-SIN:S2A-035#92:1:A>
And therefore the best means to do so is through the medium of
representational painting

<ICE-SIN:S2A-035#93:1:A>
So this you know in China later on we have people like Shi Feihong
and so on who establish art schools in in a art schools

<ICE-SIN:S2A-035#94:1:A>
And also uh specific painting styles to integrate Chinese ink
paintings and Western art

<ICE-SIN:S2A-035#95:1:A>
And in Singapore in a way the Nanyang style is a later development
of this early culture renaissance in China in the early twentieth century

<ICE-SIN:S2A-035#96:1:A>
That's one way of looking at it

<ICE-SIN:S2A-035#97:1:A>
So in a way the Nanyang style was part of the May fourth impulse
that finally develop into a kind of uhm uh South-east Asian Chinese art that
started off with with the inspiration of the early twentieth century </I>
