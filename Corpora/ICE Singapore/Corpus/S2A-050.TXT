<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-050#1:1:A>
Well I don't know about the rest of you but I enjoyed that
presentation by Doctor uh Professor Elton immensely

<ICE-SIN:S2A-050#2:1:A>
And the I was reacting right through his uh his uh lecture and I
would like to share some of the thoughts with you

<ICE-SIN:S2A-050#3:1:A>
I think one has to be careful uhm in terms of what we think we can
achieve at the university or at any institution of learning

<ICE-SIN:S2A-050#4:1:A>
I believe that education is not confine nor limited to formal
institutions

<ICE-SIN:S2A-050#5:1:A>
There are other channels of education in a family in the churches uh
in community uh organisations and uh life experiences that one goes through

<ICE-SIN:S2A-050#6:1:A>
Some it may be a little bit unfair to demand of an institution like
this that we need all the aims of education that everyone who passes through
our portals and and uh graduate uh will become quotes unquotes educated men
and women in the sense that has uh Professor Elton has uh aptly described

<ICE-SIN:S2A-050#7:1:A>
As I was listening to him and all the various wonderful objectives
that uh we ought to be working for I felt grossly inadequate not up to it
disqualified to be the kind of teacher lecturer that can fulfill those
objectives

<ICE-SIN:S2A-050#8:1:A>
I say that not to discourage you but I say that to provoke you into
thinking

<ICE-SIN:S2A-050#9:1:A>
You see let's take a typical lecturer how well qualified is he to do
this educating function

<ICE-SIN:S2A-050#10:1:A>
He's a graduate like the rest of us maybe he's has first class
honours second upper

<ICE-SIN:S2A-050#11:1:A>
He goes for a P H D abroad and he's highly specialised in that
particular field

<ICE-SIN:S2A-050#12:1:A>
His experiences in life limited to campuses a little bit off campus
emotional some stable some unstable some some in between

<ICE-SIN:S2A-050#13:1:A>
Mentally you know various stages various degrees but you can say of
him that he is vitally interested in his subject area immerse in it and is
and expect in it and developing further expertise in it

<ICE-SIN:S2A-050#14:1:A>
Then he goes before the classroom

<ICE-SIN:S2A-050#15:1:A>
His very first class he expects all the students to be graduate
student level

<ICE-SIN:S2A-050#16:1:A>
So he throws all he knows at them and finds that they are totally
out of depth

<ICE-SIN:S2A-050#17:1:A>
He learns over the years that he has to learn to communicate

<ICE-SIN:S2A-050#18:1:A>
That he cannot throw the things that he is familiar with and assume
that they can pick up like that because there's an idiom there's a language
of the subject matter that one one has

<ICE-SIN:S2A-050#19:1:A>
There are paradigms to learn models uh to emulate and to present
and theories into which to cramp all the facts that we see around us

<ICE-SIN:S2A-050#20:1:A>
So the question is how does he communicate

<ICE-SIN:S2A-050#21:1:A>
Even the rudiments that he needs to communicate to the students let
alone motivate them in other areas

<ICE-SIN:S2A-050#22:1:A>
Then take the viewpoint of the student

<ICE-SIN:S2A-050#23:1:A>
Is he graduate student calibre

<ICE-SIN:S2A-050#24:1:A>
Is he of our level that you know we can pick things up like that
react to a lecture like that and start thinking of all kinds of ideas

<ICE-SIN:S2A-050#25:1:A>
Think you must think of the average student

<ICE-SIN:S2A-050#26:1:A>
Are you communicating are we communicating successfully to the
average student

<ICE-SIN:S2A-050#27:1:A>
I go I measure myself that way

<ICE-SIN:S2A-050#28:1:A>
As I lecture I like to look at my students

<ICE-SIN:S2A-050#29:1:A>
When I see them blank looking in in Hokkien they say 'lei boh kiew'
meaning can't catch the ball can't catch what I'm saying then I go back over
the ground again

<ICE-SIN:S2A-050#30:1:A>
When I see them smiling I say ah I've achieved something and then
when the essays come in in the tutorials when they react then my heart sinks
again

<ICE-SIN:S2A-050#31:1:A>
Because I thought they understood but clearly they didn't
understand

<ICE-SIN:S2A-050#32:1:A>
So I said well I've got to start over again

<ICE-SIN:S2A-050#33:1:A>
How do I communicate

<ICE-SIN:S2A-050#34:1:A>
How do I communicate to people who are average intelligence

<ICE-SIN:S2A-050#35:1:A>
Now it doesn't mean that if somebody gets uh average grade or
mediocre grade that that person is gonna be a failure in life

<ICE-SIN:S2A-050#36:1:A>
I've witnessed many of my colleagues before third class honours
general degree

<ICE-SIN:S2A-050#37:1:A>
But they went out to be outstanding successes in life

<ICE-SIN:S2A-050#38:1:A>
What made the difference

<ICE-SIN:S2A-050#39:1:A>
I believe the university provides education outside the classroom
the various avenues that are available the societies the clubs

<ICE-SIN:S2A-050#40:1:A>
I as a student was active

<ICE-SIN:S2A-050#41:1:A>
I was a debater

<ICE-SIN:S2A-050#42:1:A>
I was an organiser of forums and so on

<ICE-SIN:S2A-050#43:1:A>
I took part in forums and I believe that these other extra
curricular avenues develop areas of a student that we can't develop and we
better confess that we can't develop them

<ICE-SIN:S2A-050#44:1:A>
At the same time too let's recognise that we cannot look after
their emotional needs

<ICE-SIN:S2A-050#45:1:A>
Many students have emotional problems and I find that uh sometimes
talking to them sometimes being able to help them financially or to get them
to a counsellor is very helpful

<ICE-SIN:S2A-050#46:1:A>
Because if they are emotionally in conflict then they can't do well

<ICE-SIN:S2A-050#47:1:A>
So there are many many factors many other factors which uh
Professor Elton did not mention but within one hour he couldn't he couldn't
have mention

<ICE-SIN:S2A-050#48:1:A>
But I think we should take all these into consideration and my
approach would be given our limited resources what's the best we can do

<ICE-SIN:S2A-050#49:1:A>
Before we motivate students are we ourselves motivated

<ICE-SIN:S2A-050#50:1:A>
I have lecturers in the past at Stanford University who openly told
us told the students

<ICE-SIN:S2A-050#51:1:A>
I don't get promoted for good teaching I get promoted for good
research so why should I bother

<ICE-SIN:S2A-050#52:1:A>
Now if if lecturers carry this kind of attitude they're not
motivated in teaching

<ICE-SIN:S2A-050#53:1:A>
They just come and do everything dot dot dot dot dot

<ICE-SIN:S2A-050#54:1:A>
Doesn't matter whether half the students are asleep and then
examine them set topics and so on

<ICE-SIN:S2A-050#55:1:A>
You can get by concentrate on your research and do very well

<ICE-SIN:S2A-050#56:1:A>
But what's the result

<ICE-SIN:S2A-050#57:1:A>
Are we interested in motivating students and how should we go about
it

<ICE-SIN:S2A-050#58:1:A>
Do we present a a lecture that is well-rounded A B C D if and but
and so on all conditions

<ICE-SIN:S2A-050#59:1:A>
Now if you did that students go to sleep

<ICE-SIN:S2A-050#60:1:A>
There's another way of presenting Chicago style

<ICE-SIN:S2A-050#61:1:A>
Get them agitated excited because you say things that you know they
they are not comfortable with

<ICE-SIN:S2A-050#62:1:A>
But they don't know how to rebut you and that makes them you know
go and look at the books and come out with something

<ICE-SIN:S2A-050#63:1:A>
That's why Chicago has produced so many Nobel prize winners okay

<ICE-SIN:S2A-050#64:1:A>
Now there are different approaches we can use but the main thing is
can we interest the students

<ICE-SIN:S2A-050#65:1:A>
Can we motivate them

<ICE-SIN:S2A-050#66:1:A>
Can we get them excited

<ICE-SIN:S2A-050#67:1:A>
You see we are excited about our areas of interest

<ICE-SIN:S2A-050#68:1:A>
Can we communicate this excitement to them this enthusiasm to them

<ICE-SIN:S2A-050#69:1:A>
If we can I think we've gone a long way

<ICE-SIN:S2A-050#70:1:A>
Thank you very much

<ICE-SIN:S2A-050#71:1:A>
Let me have my next speaker I don't know how many minutes I took

<ICE-SIN:S2A-050#72:1:A>
Doctor Andy Hor please

<ICE-SIN:S2A-050#73:1:A>
When the subject of motivating the student was given to me I found
that it was a difficult task

<ICE-SIN:S2A-050#74:1:A>
The first thing I did was to look at the dictionary what motivation
means and how I would define it for the discussion

<ICE-SIN:S2A-050#75:1:A>
I have not looked at uh any literature on that the subject

<ICE-SIN:S2A-050#76:1:A>
I have collected my thoughts as a practising teacher on this

<ICE-SIN:S2A-050#77:1:A>
So what I will do is I'll define it the way I feel it's applicable
for student learning look at the forms or factors that influence uh student
motivation

<ICE-SIN:S2A-050#78:1:A>
Finally summarise and would make out the case for student
motivation in a university setup

<ICE-SIN:S2A-050#79:1:A>
The best definition I could make out for motivation is a process of
arousing an interest for action

<ICE-SIN:S2A-050#80:1:A>
Ah that's the way I quote the define it for this purpose because
there were other definition

<ICE-SIN:S2A-050#81:1:A>
The word is one the meaning are many

<ICE-SIN:S2A-050#82:1:A>
But I think this is the one that came closer to motivation

<ICE-SIN:S2A-050#83:1:A>
That is motivation is a driving force and this force affects
student learning

<ICE-SIN:S2A-050#84:1:A>
It can come instantly or is a slow process but it must be sustained

<ICE-SIN:S2A-050#85:1:A>
Then only we have motivation

<ICE-SIN:S2A-050#86:1:A>
The driving force or the motivation can come from within or from
ithout/result <unclear> word </unclear> for learning to take place

<ICE-SIN:S2A-050#87:1:A>
But the external force that we say for motivation must eventually
become within and must be self-generated for learning to go on

<ICE-SIN:S2A-050#88:1:A>
So though we say external or internal the external must eventually
come internal in the student for sustained uh learning

<ICE-SIN:S2A-050#89:1:A>
You might also ask the question why motivate students uh in a
university setup

<ICE-SIN:S2A-050#90:1:A>
They are tertiary students

<ICE-SIN:S2A-050#91:1:A>
They are adults

<ICE-SIN:S2A-050#92:1:A>
Is motivation necessary

<ICE-SIN:S2A-050#93:1:A>
I feel motivation is necessary because the time a student comes to
university's very short

<ICE-SIN:S2A-050#94:1:A>
It may be three years or five years as in the Medical Faculty

<ICE-SIN:S2A-050#95:1:A>
During that period they are undergoing a transformation

<ICE-SIN:S2A-050#96:1:A>
It's a short period you know and during this period of
transformation that is as Professor Elton said they are preparing for life

<ICE-SIN:S2A-050#97:1:A>
We can influence them so they learn and continue to learn

<ICE-SIN:S2A-050#98:1:A>
So there is a need for uh motivation <unclear> word </unclear> in a
university setup

<ICE-SIN:S2A-050#99:1:A>
As an illustration I thought I would take my subject Biology or
Medicine

<ICE-SIN:S2A-050#100:1:A>
If we take a bone cell or how bone is formed and here this similar
one would be a parallel rubic <unclear> word </unclear> learning

<ICE-SIN:S2A-050#101:1:A>
We need a cell we need nourishment and we need a stimulus

<ICE-SIN:S2A-050#102:1:A>
However appropriate the cell is unless you have a stimulus and
nourishment the cell cannot produce bone

<ICE-SIN:S2A-050#103:1:A>
Similarly how uh good the student is unless we have the
nourishment and the stimulus we cannot get our learning

<ICE-SIN:S2A-050#104:1:A>
So this is very vital so I thought I would illustrate it that way

<ICE-SIN:S2A-050#105:1:A>
I shall look at the some of the factors or forms in which I feel
are important uh for motivation for learning

<ICE-SIN:S2A-050#106:1:A>
The first one I take is the teacher as a stimulus or driving force

<ICE-SIN:S2A-050#107:1:A>
He must love to teach be committed and be concerned for the
student be inspiring and have a infectious enthusiasm

<ICE-SIN:S2A-050#108:1:A>
If you look back uh inspiring teachers have always attracted the
students to their discipline

<ICE-SIN:S2A-050#109:1:A>
They do a deeper learning of the subject and they subsequently
devoted their life in that discipline whether it is medicine science or art

<ICE-SIN:S2A-050#110:1:A>
And I think that comes through motivation

<ICE-SIN:S2A-050#111:1:A>
And to do motivation you need close contact and that is the form
it must take between the student and teacher

<ICE-SIN:S2A-050#112:1:A>
In addition as it was said earlier they must not put off or kill
student enthusiasm

<ICE-SIN:S2A-050#113:1:A>
They must identify the good ones and the bad ones as you said so
that we look at the good ones and make them better

<ICE-SIN:S2A-050#114:1:A>
And also identify the ones at risk and see that they do not fall
by the wayside

<ICE-SIN:S2A-050#115:1:A>
In addition I think a good teacher motivates I feel through
demonstrating a mind at work uh be it analysis in analysis in synthesis or
problem-solving skills

<ICE-SIN:S2A-050#116:1:A>
And this method I feel attracts students to learning and motivates
them

<ICE-SIN:S2A-050#117:1:A>
Secondly I shall consider the role of the faculty and a department
as a stimulus or driving force for student learning for motivation

<ICE-SIN:S2A-050#118:1:A>
Though we can say the responsibility for learning is that of the
student and the teacher

<ICE-SIN:S2A-050#119:1:A>
I think we must also consider in addition the faculty and the
departments have a definite role in motivating

<ICE-SIN:S2A-050#120:1:A>
Not only must they they have a role it must be very transparent to
the student that they are committed to this

<ICE-SIN:S2A-050#121:1:A>
And they must demonstrate this

<ICE-SIN:S2A-050#122:1:A>
Then it pervades down the whole faculty and the department and
improves learning

<ICE-SIN:S2A-050#123:1:A>
Thirdly I want to look at the role of friends peers in the class
for motivation

<ICE-SIN:S2A-050#124:1:A>
Our students are usually motivated by group learning with their
friends

<ICE-SIN:S2A-050#125:1:A>
It may be while in the class or even outside the class

<ICE-SIN:S2A-050#126:1:A>
And this can trigger and sustain motivation and I feel this must
be also be encouraged for motivation

<ICE-SIN:S2A-050#127:1:A>
Fourthly I come to assessment and examination which Professor
Elton touched on as a factor for motivation student learning <X>

<ICE-SIN:S2A-050#X128:1:A>
I think our assessment methods have an impact on students'
learning But we must also take into account the students will also learn to
pass examinations Therefore our assessment methods can be changed and geared
to stimulate a deep learning and in addition to achieving our objectives </X>
