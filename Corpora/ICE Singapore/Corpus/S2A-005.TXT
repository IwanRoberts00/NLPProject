<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-005#1:1:A>
One thing they can tell

<ICE-SIN:S2A-005#2:1:A>
The Thais is not to take the guys in green lightly

<ICE-SIN:S2A-005#3:1:A>
Myanmar's football have certainly their football has certainly been
more colourful than their outfits

<ICE-SIN:S2A-005#4:1:A>
Allowing it to run Vitoon

<ICE-SIN:S2A-005#5:1:A>
Here's Attapong

<ICE-SIN:S2A-005#6:1:A>
Offside though

<ICE-SIN:S2A-005#7:1:A>
Well I've got a feeling that Soe naing who uh did quite a good job
marking Fandi Ahmad out at the first ninety minutes of the game against
Singapore in the semi-finals will be given the task of marking Piyahpong
again and Min zaw who went for Sundram that day will go for Vitoon

<ICE-SIN:S2A-005#8:1:A>
He has lost it for a little while

<ICE-SIN:S2A-005#9:1:A>
Actually that was Min zaw oo and Soe naing with that saving tackle

<ICE-SIN:S2A-005#10:1:A>
Then Toe Aung

<ICE-SIN:S2A-005#11:1:A>
So a nervous start indeed for Myanmar

<ICE-SIN:S2A-005#12:1:A>
They're an inexperience squad not used to matches of this high
magnitude

<ICE-SIN:S2A-005#13:1:A>
But like I've said they've maintained nice splat of oozing
self-belief and confidence

<ICE-SIN:S2A-005#14:1:A>
They need it more so now

<ICE-SIN:S2A-005#15:1:A>
Kyi Lwin who is one of their more experienced players

<ICE-SIN:S2A-005#16:1:A>
They'll be a calling on him to over ball in mid-field and settle
the team down

<ICE-SIN:S2A-005#17:1:A>
At the moment it's Thailand who are faster in settling down

<ICE-SIN:S2A-005#18:1:A>
Ye Htut

<ICE-SIN:S2A-005#19:1:A>
It would be at a right time there for Myanmar

<ICE-SIN:S2A-005#20:1:A>
Not a very good clearance

<ICE-SIN:S2A-005#21:1:A>
Surachai Min zaw oo with good tackle and here's Myo Hlaing the top
scorer of this competition with six goals

<ICE-SIN:S2A-005#22:1:A>
Tin Myo Aung who uh was taken over Myint Aung up front <unclear>
word </unclear> to bounce to the ball then and here's Attapong

<ICE-SIN:S2A-005#23:1:A>
Vitoon Kijmongkonsak wins the first corner of the afternoon in the
SEA Games soccer final

<ICE-SIN:S2A-005#24:1:A>
Thailand after four minutes are looking livelier and brighter up
front and uh passing has been more fluent as well

<ICE-SIN:S2A-005#25:1:A>
But Myanmar it is who win the header

<ICE-SIN:S2A-005#26:1:A>
It's not all the way out though

<ICE-SIN:S2A-005#27:1:A>
They're slow in moving up

<ICE-SIN:S2A-005#28:1:A>
That's why Vitton is offside

<ICE-SIN:S2A-005#29:1:A>
Apichad almost got to the end of it

<ICE-SIN:S2A-005#30:1:A>
Tawan Sripan well won though by Than Toe Aung

<ICE-SIN:S2A-005#31:1:A>
Good ball clear by Toe Aung

<ICE-SIN:S2A-005#32:1:A>
And that's Myanmar's football for you throughout this tournament

<ICE-SIN:S2A-005#33:1:A>
Nice one touch passing

<ICE-SIN:S2A-005#34:1:A>
Oh it's saved by the Thai goalkeeper and that's one of the greatest
goals you'll ever see at the National Stadium scored by that guy again Myo
Hlaing Win

<ICE-SIN:S2A-005#35:1:A>
Myanmar ahead in the SEA Games soccer final and really the
inexperience of the eighteen year old goalkeeper Somcit Wacharapong was very
evident there in the Thai goal

<ICE-SIN:S2A-005#36:1:A>
It's a big sin in goal keeping

<ICE-SIN:S2A-005#37:1:A>
You'll always have to make sure that your body is behind the ball

<ICE-SIN:S2A-005#38:1:A>
At time his body wasn't even around that and his reflexes were very
poor

<ICE-SIN:S2A-005#39:1:A>
That's the way to do it says Aung Kyaw Kyaw as he gathered that
shot from uh Attakpong quite easily and really that effort looked harmless

<ICE-SIN:S2A-005#40:1:A>
Vitton

<ICE-SIN:S2A-005#41:1:A>
This is turning out to be a magnificent final

<ICE-SIN:S2A-005#42:1:A>
Unbelievable and you're just describing Myanmar's character and how
interesting it is if Thailand were to go a ball down since they haven't been
a goal down before in the tournament

<ICE-SIN:S2A-005#43:1:A>
Well this is their <unclear> word </unclear>

<ICE-SIN:S2A-005#44:1:A>
Well we were just talking about Vitoon being up front with Piyapong
and Vitoon doesn't have the pace of a striker and doesn't have the
traditional sense of a striker but he's certainly showed the finishing
touches of a striker

<ICE-SIN:S2A-005#45:1:A>
Then Piyapong just well

<ICE-SIN:S2A-005#46:1:A>
He's all fired up for the final

<ICE-SIN:S2A-005#47:1:A>
Yes <unclear> word </unclear> he set the tournament alive like we
expected him to so

<ICE-SIN:S2A-005#48:1:A>
But when Piyapong is on form and the Thais are now inspired

<ICE-SIN:S2A-005#49:1:A>
Myanmar better watch them

<ICE-SIN:S2A-005#50:1:A>
Well that's been Myanmar's football all the time in the games

<ICE-SIN:S2A-005#51:1:A>
They'll score a goal

<ICE-SIN:S2A-005#52:1:A>
They'll conceive one

<ICE-SIN:S2A-005#53:1:A>
It's always hoping but they always believe in attacking

<ICE-SIN:S2A-005#54:1:A>
Whatever the case Kyaw Kyaw the <unclear> word </unclear> looking
suspect indeed and being with a cross so we have two goals in two minutes

<ICE-SIN:S2A-005#55:1:A>
So naing in the fifth for Myanamr and Vitoon in the seventh for
Thailand

<ICE-SIN:S2A-005#56:1:A>
It's one all a well-balanced final indeed

<ICE-SIN:S2A-005#57:1:A>
I suppose exactly what happened in the bang against Malaysia and
they're going a goal up earlier on and then Malaysia scoring fairly quicker

<ICE-SIN:S2A-005#58:1:A>
Myanmar have been very disciplined moving forward but not really at
the back

<ICE-SIN:S2A-005#59:1:A>
That was the eighth goal conceived from them

<ICE-SIN:S2A-005#60:1:A>
Kyi Lywin lovely play by Kyi Lywin again

<ICE-SIN:S2A-005#61:1:A>
And he's taken off against uh Singapore and it seems that he was
taken off at half time probably to rest him for the final and that's how
confident the Myanmar players were

<ICE-SIN:S2A-005#62:1:A>
He was limping a bit but he wasn't really that bad when you
consider that Malek had pulled a hamstring in the semi-finals and was taken
off immediately before the scoring of the two sides

<ICE-SIN:S2A-005#63:1:A>
Well played by Moe Kyaw

<ICE-SIN:S2A-005#64:1:A>
Tawan Sripan

<ICE-SIN:S2A-005#65:1:A>
This is a wonderful run by him

<ICE-SIN:S2A-005#66:1:A>
He's beaten two men two men

<ICE-SIN:S2A-005#67:1:A>
Nine <unclear> word </unclear> up for Vitoon again and well we
apologise as the scorer of Thailand

<ICE-SIN:S2A-005#68:1:A>
Well there was no need to actually

<ICE-SIN:S2A-005#69:1:A>
It's was just very badly struck from the number forty

<ICE-SIN:S2A-005#70:1:A>
Thailand goal will relate to that very well

<ICE-SIN:S2A-005#71:1:A>
Thailand have certainly started the game up much brighter and more
confident than Myanmar

<ICE-SIN:S2A-005#72:1:A>
Well with the experience big big game well turning it on that
counts most

<ICE-SIN:S2A-005#73:1:A>
Thailand are certainly going it towards a gold medal in the SEA
Games soccer final and it's that guy Piyapong Pueon who wins a header two
headers

<ICE-SIN:S2A-005#74:1:A>
Remember in the final in nineteen eighty-three against Singapore
got Thailand on the way to a two one victory on the gold medal and this
header could prove to be very important as well in the eleventh minute
Thailand lead by two goals to one

<ICE-SIN:S2A-005#75:1:A>
Once again very poor defending by Myanmar

<ICE-SIN:S2A-005#76:1:A>
He's already stated that this could be his last SEA Games and they
want to bring the gold medal back desperately to Thailand

<ICE-SIN:S2A-005#77:1:A>
They haven't won it since nineteen eighty-five and they win
Singapore two nil on home ground

<ICE-SIN:S2A-005#78:1:A>
But Myo Hlaing we all know about Myanmar's come back <unclear> word
</unclear> how determined they are and they <unclear> word </unclear> back at
you

<ICE-SIN:S2A-005#79:1:A>
Good work once again by Myo Hlaing

<ICE-SIN:S2A-005#80:1:A>
Thought that was a foul actually and they claim that it's a pass
back by the defender Myo Hlaing

<ICE-SIN:S2A-005#81:1:A>
The goalkeeper didn't pick that one up

<ICE-SIN:S2A-005#82:1:A>
So a relief indeed to Somcit Wacharapong

<ICE-SIN:S2A-005#83:1:A>
His fifth minute error is giving Myanmar that kind of start

<ICE-SIN:S2A-005#84:1:A>
They wanted Myo Hlaing

<ICE-SIN:S2A-005#85:1:A>
He has been the live wire of the Myanmar team at the moment

<ICE-SIN:S2A-005#86:1:A>
Myo Hlaing

<ICE-SIN:S2A-005#87:1:A>
He's the only one who wants the ball just attacking it

<ICE-SIN:S2A-005#88:1:A>
The rest they're just waiting for the ball to land at their feet

<ICE-SIN:S2A-005#89:1:A>
Kyaw Kyaw finding some room for that cross

<ICE-SIN:S2A-005#90:1:A>
Myanmar remember the privilege two of the most exciting matches in
the SEA Games against Malaysia and of course the epic battle in the
semi-final against Singapore

<ICE-SIN:S2A-005#91:1:A>
Myo Aung Tawan Sripan too much of the ball

<ICE-SIN:S2A-005#92:1:A>
Myo Hlaing wins

<ICE-SIN:S2A-005#93:1:A>
Good skill again by Myo Hlaing

<ICE-SIN:S2A-005#94:1:A>
Oh lovely ball played outside

<ICE-SIN:S2A-005#95:1:A>
Here's Ye Htut

<ICE-SIN:S2A-005#96:1:A>
Can he get the cross in

<ICE-SIN:S2A-005#97:1:A>
No and he doesn't even get the corner

<ICE-SIN:S2A-005#98:1:A>
Good work by Surasak Tungsurat

<ICE-SIN:S2A-005#99:1:A>
Nice little leap by Piyahpong

<ICE-SIN:S2A-005#100:1:A>
Well won in the air

<ICE-SIN:S2A-005#101:1:A>
Here's Surasak Tungsurat

<ICE-SIN:S2A-005#102:1:A>
There Phathanapong not convincely

<ICE-SIN:S2A-005#103:1:A>
Surachai as well

<ICE-SIN:S2A-005#104:1:A>
Here's Apichad Thaveechalerndit

<ICE-SIN:S2A-005#105:1:A>
He started out as a right back in this tournament and he's moved
forward to uh mid-field now

<ICE-SIN:S2A-005#106:1:A>
After is he's <unclear> word </unclear> placed in the middle of
the path against Malaysia and Indonesia

<ICE-SIN:S2A-005#107:1:A>
Good work by the seventeen year old Zaw oo and here's Kyi Lwin

<ICE-SIN:S2A-005#108:1:A>
That's more like it from Kyi Lwin the spreading play up

<ICE-SIN:S2A-005#109:1:A>
Myo Hlaing taking over

<ICE-SIN:S2A-005#110:1:A>
Good play

<ICE-SIN:S2A-005#111:1:A>
Here's Kyi Lwin

<ICE-SIN:S2A-005#112:1:A>
Myo Hlaing again

<ICE-SIN:S2A-005#113:1:A>
Great tackle second time around as well by Apichad
Thaveechalermdit and Myanmar could be in trouble here

<ICE-SIN:S2A-005#114:1:A>
The Thais are very quick

<ICE-SIN:S2A-005#115:1:A>
They're trying to break that time on the counter

<ICE-SIN:S2A-005#116:1:A>
They almost did

<ICE-SIN:S2A-005#117:1:A>
Then Toe Aung who scored five goals in the tournament so far

<ICE-SIN:S2A-005#118:1:A>
Nice

<ICE-SIN:S2A-005#119:1:A>
Oh it was a typical Myanmar move

<ICE-SIN:S2A-005#120:1:A>
Myanmar are very slick on the ground doing a lot of player

<ICE-SIN:S2A-005#121:1:A>
Surachai Jaturappattarapong <unclear> word </unclear> beating
almost didn't work

<ICE-SIN:S2A-005#122:1:A>
And it's gone out and we've got quarter of an hour gone by and a
lot of action

<ICE-SIN:S2A-005#123:1:A>
Three goals to talk about

<ICE-SIN:S2A-005#124:1:A>
Two to Thailand

<ICE-SIN:S2A-005#125:1:A>
One to Myanmar and now we even have uh substitution

<ICE-SIN:S2A-005#126:1:A>
Early one

<ICE-SIN:S2A-005#127:1:A>
Saw Ba Myint has been taken off

<ICE-SIN:S2A-005#128:1:A>
He hasn't had a good time

<ICE-SIN:S2A-005#129:1:A>
At the back Saw Ba Myint the sweeper and uh they have changed it
to Than win

<ICE-SIN:S2A-005#130:1:A>
This is really a gamble by the coach playing someone to the heart
of defence who's only had one game prior to this game

<ICE-SIN:S2A-005#131:1:A>
Easy cross to deal with

<ICE-SIN:S2A-005#132:1:A>
He wanted something spectacular the substitute Than win

<ICE-SIN:S2A-005#133:1:A>
and after both sides after that <unclear> word </unclear> have
settle down a little Good ball once again by Kyi Lwin

<ICE-SIN:S2A-005#134:1:A>
Nice movement upfront by Myanmar

<ICE-SIN:S2A-005#135:1:A>
It's not being shown at the moment and perhaps that is where they
are missing Wyin Aung now Wyn Aung does a lot of the after ball movement

<ICE-SIN:S2A-005#136:1:A>
Surachai Surasak

<ICE-SIN:S2A-005#137:1:A>
Easy for the defender there

<ICE-SIN:S2A-005#138:1:A>
Soe Moe Kyaw

<ICE-SIN:S2A-005#139:1:A>
An unorthodox <unclear> word </unclear> he's playing for Noe Kyaw
because he plays a left mid-field when they're attacking and left back on the
defender

<ICE-SIN:S2A-005#140:1:A>
Offside Vitoon Kijmongkonsak <unclear> word </unclear>

<ICE-SIN:S2A-005#141:1:A>
Offside clearly for that

<ICE-SIN:S2A-005#142:1:A>
Well any three of the players in Thai team as starting to line up
in today's final Played in the Merlion Cup Tournament way back in December
and they send really they've re-teamed it

<ICE-SIN:S2A-005#143:1:A>
For there's a lot of depth in Thailand foot in Thai football

<ICE-SIN:S2A-005#144:1:A>
Have they not got they own semi-professional leave back home

<ICE-SIN:S2A-005#145:1:A>
Well the only weakness actually you can spot off Myanmar's Kyi
Lwin is that he doesn't get back and defend as uh as his good as his
attacking players

<ICE-SIN:S2A-005#146:1:A>
<unclear> word </unclear> Aung hung the body of Surasak <unclear>
word </unclear>

<ICE-SIN:S2A-005#147:1:A>
Even bury and his way

<ICE-SIN:S2A-005#148:1:A>
Ye Htut Kyi Lwin plays for Perak of course in the semi-pro league

<ICE-SIN:S2A-005#149:1:A>
Here he is again

<ICE-SIN:S2A-005#150:1:A>
Oh

<ICE-SIN:S2A-005#151:1:A>
Now that's probably summarises Myanmar's uh feel of the moment
towards this game

<ICE-SIN:S2A-005#152:1:A>
A lack of cohesion at the back which is very evident

<ICE-SIN:S2A-005#153:1:A>
And of course all control and in that time by Surachai
Jaturapattarapong

<ICE-SIN:S2A-005#154:1:A>
Here's Myo Hlaing win who has been the best player so far

<ICE-SIN:S2A-005#155:1:A>
A time well shut up by Surasak

<ICE-SIN:S2A-005#156:1:A>
Nobody offering support though for Surachai and he makes place for
the shot

<ICE-SIN:S2A-005#157:1:A>
He tried to curl it but nobody saw them

<ICE-SIN:S2A-005#158:1:A>
That was uh an old Thai error

<ICE-SIN:S2A-005#159:1:A>
They're not running it to place and no support up front

<ICE-SIN:S2A-005#160:1:A>
That was very evident in the semi-final the first half semi-final
against Indonesia and also in the first half against Myanmar in the opening
match and that time the same time we saw the old Myanmar error of not
attacking the player on the ball

<ICE-SIN:S2A-005#161:1:A>
Apichad Thaveechalermdit

<ICE-SIN:S2A-005#162:1:A>
Nice little one to play with Vitoon exquisitely done there

<ICE-SIN:S2A-005#163:1:A>
Great skill by the number fourteen to bear it off and laid back
for Apichad who made some nice good running into the penalty box

<ICE-SIN:S2A-005#164:1:A>
Certainly sample something from Myanmar there

<ICE-SIN:S2A-005#165:1:A>
The Thais and they could learnt how to defend against there as
well

<ICE-SIN:S2A-005#166:1:A>
Myo Hlaing

<ICE-SIN:S2A-005#167:1:A>
He's been trying to prove too much at times

<ICE-SIN:S2A-005#168:1:A>
Myo Hlaing win

<ICE-SIN:S2A-005#169:1:A>
Oh poor ball by Moe Kyaw Apichad who has been busy in mid-field

<ICE-SIN:S2A-005#170:1:A>
Natee Tongsukkao

<ICE-SIN:S2A-005#171:1:A>
Well that call it his solid defender at their tournament

<ICE-SIN:S2A-005#172:1:A>
Here he is again

<ICE-SIN:S2A-005#173:1:A>
He's been cleared by Than win

<ICE-SIN:S2A-005#174:1:A>
Halfway through this match and Thailand are leading by two goals
to one

<ICE-SIN:S2A-005#175:1:A>
All the action coming in the first ten minutes

<ICE-SIN:S2A-005#176:1:A>
Poor finish by Tawan Sriman and I don't ever remember him having a
shot on target rather tournament Tawam Sriman

<ICE-SIN:S2A-005#177:1:A>
<unclear> word </unclear> and certainly it's uh Myanmar throwing
an unfamiliar sight there at the National Stadium and not passing the ball
around and too <unclear> word </unclear> spread out very well and it's
contested again on this side

<ICE-SIN:S2A-005#178:1:A>
The Thais will like this

<ICE-SIN:S2A-005#179:1:A>
The Myanmar players really have to go in and attack them and stop
the game in mid-field <X>

<ICE-SIN:S2A-005#X180:1:A>
That's where the Thais are winning the battle at the moment
Department separate the winner and the loser Apichad Thaveechalermdit Soe
Aung chasing it and Thais happy to just toss the ball around Defenders three
goals to one league They finally lose it What can Myanmar do now Moe Kyaw
Good play by Soe Moe Kyaw Well it's a nice one here by Moe Kyaw A chance
though now for Than Toe Aung who's happy to settle for the corner strangely
because there are two players in the box waiting for the all important cut
back to the byline </X> </I>
