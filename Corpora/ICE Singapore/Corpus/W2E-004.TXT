<h> <bold> A deserved prize </bold> </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-004#2:1>
<p> THE award of the Nobel peace prize to Soviet President Mikhail
Gorbachev this year was an entirely deserved one.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-004#3:1>
No figure in modern history has done as much as the indefatigable Mr
Gorbachev to recast what appeared to be the iron laws of Cold War politics.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-004#4:1>
Almost single-handed, he took the Soviet Union from being the bane of
the free world to one of its newest, and most prized members. </p>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-004#5:1>
<p> Protestations by Soviet leaders that they were working for international
peace, which had taken on an incantatory quality not even the speakers
themselves seemed to believe in, have been given a fresh lease of life.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-004#6:1>
That word <mention> life </mention> is significant.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-004#7:1>
Mr Gorbachev's revolution will literally save lives, thousands of
lives, both Russian and local, which would be lost in another Afghanistan or
Angola.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-004#8:1>
The Nobel peace prize, as the highest of such awards, is a proper
recognition of the magnitude of Mr Gorbachev's contribution to a
peaceful world. </p>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-004#9:1>
<p> However, as someone quipped, Mr Gorbachev did not get the Nobel
prize in economics.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-004#10:1>
The Soviet Union is in a sorry state as its economy threatens to come
apart and take with it whatever little political will keeps the country
united.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-004#11:1>
Mr Gorbachev has to move fast to ensure that the gains on the
international front are not lost at home.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-004#12:1>
If they are, there is no knowing where the Soviet Union will be
headed and what its demands of the International order will be.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-004#13:1>
Moscow's international friends can do only so much; the real impetus
for reform must come from within.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-004#14:1>
While it takes time to turn around countries as large and complex as
the Soviet Union, the frightening truth is that Mr Gorbachev does not have
much time. </p> </I>

<h> <bold> Time to let go </bold> </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-004#16:2>
<p> A BOOK aptly entitled Soviet Disunion, published this year, sketches four
possible scenarios for the Soviet Union in the l990s.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-004#17:2>
The first is the gradual disintegration of the empire; the second,
the creation of a Soviet Commonwealth; the third, a genuinely federal
country; and the fourth, the restoration of Imperial authoritarianism.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-004#18:2>
The authors, Messrs Bohdan Nahaylo and Victor Swoboda,
say that these are scenarios for the l990s.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-004#19:2>
All indications are, however, that a stark choice may have to be made
as early as next year.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-004#20:2>
There is an overwhelming consensus in the constituent republics that
the Soviet Union cannot continue in its present form.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-004#21:2>
The only real questions are whether the Kremlin will allow peaceful
change, or whether the country will tear apart, or whether reactionary
elements in the military, the KGB and the Communist Party will try to
reassert central authority.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-004#22:2>
The last possibility is very real, but not only is it questionable
whether force will be sufficient to quell nationalist discontent, it is also
certain that the West's attitude to the Soviet Union will change dramatically
if the bayonet is used to keep the empire together.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-004#23:2>
It is to be hoped that Soviet dependence on Western food and other
aid will cause the reactionaries to think three times before taking any
precipitate action. </p>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-004#24:2>
<p> Since nationalist feelings will not go away, the only feasible solution
is one that sees a real devolution of economic and political powers to the
republics, which will effectively become nations that can decide how to
regulate their relations with one another.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-004#25:2>
Admittedly, this is not going to be easy.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-004#26:2>
A reformulation of the federal structure that involves multiple
transfers of population will affect the substantial numbers of Russians
living in the non-Russian republics and <foreign> <it> vice versa </it>
</foreign> , a relocation made doubly difficult by the country's parlous
financial situation.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-004#27:2>
Then, there is a high level of integration in the Soviet economy,
made up of a series of intermeshing links between factories and firms
across the country.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-004#28:2>
These links, in matters such as the supply of raw materials at often
artificially low prices determined by Moscow, might be costly for some
republics to snap.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-004#29:2>
The counter-argument is that the republics will be free to set up new
trade regimes determined by market forces.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-004#30:2>
Indeed, they are doing this to a certain extent even now, and since
many of these republics simply refuse to accept economic directions
from the Kremlin or co-ordinate their economic policies anyway, it is
best to legitimise what is <foreign> <it> de facto </it> </foreign> and
make it <foreign> <it> de jure </it> </foreign> . </p>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-004#31:2>
<p> Doing so involves an act of will.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-004#32:2>
The problem is that there is a lack of meeting ground between the
Kremlin and the republics.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-004#33:2>
President Mikhail Gorbachev has always accepted the Soviet
structure as a given and thus is too parsimonious in the autonomy he is
willing to allow the republics.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-004#34:2>
Leaders of the republics, on their part, are making extreme,
and indeed often unrealistic, demands of Moscow in a bid to preserve
popular support back home.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-004#35:2>
The gulf is dramatised by the repeated rejection of Mr Gorbachev's
constitutional offers by the republics, which are set on
immediate and unconditional independence.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-004#36:2>
The problem is compounded by bad blood between the Kremlin,
which sees itself as the preserver of Soviet unity, and the rich and powerful
Russian Federation, which sees itself as the greatest economic,
political and cultural beneficiary of sucession from the Soviet Union.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-004#37:2>
There is tier upon tier of disunity. </p>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-004#38:2>
<p> It is time wiser counsel prevailed, and all sides got together, not to
accost each other as enemies but as partners who have the delicate, but by no
means impossible, job of devising a new constitutional framework for
the Soviet Union.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-004#39:2>
Letting the Baltic states leave might be the first step towards the
creation of a Soviet Commonwealth that can combine self-government with the
retention of necessary economic links.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-004#40:2>
Mr Gorbachev owes his country a peaceful devolution of the Kremlin's
powers.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-004#41:2>
He does not have very much time in which to do it. </p> </I>
<I>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-004#42:3>
<h> <bold> Last stand in Moscow </bold> </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-004#43:3>
<p> LOOKING back at all the signals coming out of Moscow in recent months,
the only surprise about the coup against Mr Mikhail Gorbachev is that anyone
should have been surprised at all.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-004#44:3>
Ever since former Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze warned
last December that the country was heading towards a dictatorship, hardline
opponents of Mr Gorbachev have been calling for his ouster.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-004#45:3>
In April, the rightwing Soyuz group in the Soviet parliament
circulated a petition among members demanding a special session at which he
was to be called to account and removed.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-004#46:3>
In June, hardliners within the government briefly attempted a
constitutional coup and sought unsuccessfully to transfer many of his powers
to Mr Valentin Pavlov, the conservative Prime Minister.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-004#47:3>
A month later, a group of 12 hardliners accused reformers of leading
the country to ruin and called on the military to step in.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-004#48:3>
The military's response was a statement on Friday in the Armed Forces
daily, Krasnaya Zvezda, asserting that the Communist Party and armed forces
were under open assault from anti-communist forces and appealing to
party members to close ranks in defence of the <quote> socialist
Fatherland </quote> . </p>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-004#49:3>
<p> The hardliners' anger against Mr Gorbachev is not wholly unjustified.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-004#50:3>
While the world might see him as the visionary who ended the
debilitating Cold War and as the gallant reformer trying to drag his country
into the modern era of growth and democracy, to them, he is the man whose
policies were destroying thc empire bequeathed to them by the Russian tsars
and which the Communist Party had turned into a superpower.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-004#51:3>
In the manner of coup-makers everywhere, the hardliners have
exaggerated the disorder in the Soviet Union to justify their move - but not
by much: The country was gripped by chaos and anarchy and, in the words of
the so-called state-of-emergency committee, had become ungovernable.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-004#52:3>
The problem is that the committee is unlikely to be able to do any
better than Mr Gorbachev and may, in fact, provoke far greater disorder and
bloodshed than the country has seen so far. </p>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-004#53:3>
<p> Throughout the country's long-running crisis, the hardliners have not
produced a single constructive proposal to rescue it from its most
basic problem - an economy that is in terminal decline.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-004#54:3>
Their only platform has been that law-and-order must be restored, and
this is what they pledge to do now.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-004#55:3>
The question is: how?

<ICE-SIN:W2E-004#56:3>
Although they command awesome powers on paper, they do not have
troops enough to quell the entire country should the republican and local
governments and the millions who voted them into office - in their parlance,
the <quote> extremist forces </quote> - refuse to submit to their
orders.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-004#57:3>
Indeed, it is not at all certain that the troops that they do have
would do their bidding.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-004#58:3>
They may, when it comes to the crunch, simply fade away.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-004#59:3>
And even assuming the best-case scenario for the coup-makers, the one
clear lesson of recent decades is that the command system simply does not
work; the economy cannot be commanded to produce. </p>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-004#60:3>
<p> There was tacit recognition of this in the first address by the new
regime's acting President, Mr Gennady Yanayev, when he stated that the
emergency measures were only temporary and <quote> in no way mean
renunciation of the course towards profound reforms in all spheres of life of
the state and society </quote> .

<ICE-SIN:W2E-004#61:3>
But reform, in today's Soviet context, necessarily means
altering the power balance between the centre and the republics, and
that is precisely the point the hardliners refuse to concede.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-004#62:3>
By removing Mr Gorbachev when they did, the hardliners prevented his
signing the new union treaty devolving key powers to the republics.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-004#63:3>
Ultimately, however, they will have to take the same route if they
are to have any chance of success at all in their proclaimed task of saving
the country.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-004#64:3>
Without the free consent of the republics, and their peoples,
the enterprise is doomed to fail. </p> </I>
<I>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-004#65:4>
<h> <bold> Averting a bloody split </bold> </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-004#66:4>
<p> WHEN the Bolsheviks seized power in Russia 74 years ago, they promised
the non-Russian peoples of the vast tsarist empire self-determination - and
wound up controlling them more tightly than the Tsars had done.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-004#67:4>
Ten days ago, their bumbling heirs launched an abortive coup to try
and save the empire - and dealt it its <foreign> <it> coup de grace </it>
</foreign> .

<ICE-SIN:W2E-004#68:4>
The Soviet Union is not just, as President Mikhail Gorbachev put it,
<quote> a different country </quote> from the one it was before the coup
attempt.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-004#69:4>
As things look now, the Soviet Union effectively no longer exists as
a political entity.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-004#70:4>
The institutions and apparatus of state power remain - and are
being swiftly absorbed one after another by the Russian republic under
President Boris Yeltsin.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-004#71:4>
They are also becoming more irrelevant by the day as the
centrifugal passions unleashed by the coup and its aftermath spread to republics
once only remarkable for their fealty to - and dependence on - the
union. </p>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-004#72:4>
<p> Some other form of association will be devised to take its place, if only
because economically, the republics are highly dependent on one another and
especially on Russia.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-004#73:4>
It is the only one of the 15 to be near economic self-sufficiency.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-004#74:4>
It subsidises the others to the tune of some 70 billion roubles
a year, equivalent to about 7 per cent of the Soviet GNP.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-004#75:4>
More important, all the republics are bound by a system that
commanded that just one or two factories would supply the entire Soviet
economy with a particular product.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-004#76:4>
Theoretically, that need not be an insurmountable barrier; what
the republics can no longer get from former partners, they can always import
from elsewhere.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-004#77:4>
In practice, that option does not exist for the republics, none
having the hard currency to pay for its needs or sufficiently attractive
goods to trade for them.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-004#78:4>
It is this realisation that lies behind yesterday's agreement between
Mr Gorbachev and the presidents of the Russia, Kazakhstan and Kirghizia
to draw up an agreement on economic cooperation to be open to all 15
republics. </p>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-004#79:4>
<p> But even assuming the best, that all or the majority of the 15 will sign
on, the economic agreement is no substitute for the union treaty that was to
have been signed the day after the coup but which has now been rejected as no
longer acceptable, even by those who were its strongest proponents. <X>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-004#X80:4>
The search is now on for an alternative pact, but whether a formula
can be found to satisfy all the key republics is doubtful.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-004#X81:4>
President Yeltsin and his aides, by their words and actions during
and after the coup, have made clear that Russia sees itself as the big
brother of the new union.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-004#X82:4>
But at least two of the republics reject that claim, namely Ukraine,
the second-richest and most populous after Russia, and
Kazakhstan, the second-largest, which responded to Russian threats that it
might want to review its frontiers with republics seceding without its
agreement by issuing its own warning, that war could break out if that
happened. </p>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-004#X83:4>
<p> It is probably a little premature to say that the Soviet Union will go
the way of Yugoslavia.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-004#X84:4>
But the potential for that happening is enormous.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-004#X85:4>
Of the 23 inter-republican borders, only three are not contested.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-004#X86:4>
Nearly as many Russians ( 60 million) live outside the Russian
republic as inside it ( 82 million) and virtually every republic has
significant minorities which want their own independence from the
majority population there.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-004#X87:4>
Not surprisingly for a state spanning 10 time zones, Russia itself
is the prime example, having within its borders 31 " autonomous" republics,
regions and areas - containing some of its most important factories,
and raw materials.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-004#X88:4>
Already creaky before the coup attempt, when there was still some
semblance of central authority that the key republics acknowledged at least
nominally, the entire Soviet edifice could collapse, and very bloodily, if Mr
Yeltsin and other republican leaders do not proceed with great
restraint and care in the days and weeks ahead.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-004#X89:4>
That crack-up, unlike Yugoslavia's, will not be easy for the world
to ignore. </p> </X> </I>
