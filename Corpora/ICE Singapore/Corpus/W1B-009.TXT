Dharamsala,

<ICE-SIN:W1B-009#2:1>
21/2/94

<ICE-SIN:W1B-009#3:1>
Dearest Mary,

<ICE-SIN:W1B-009#4:1>
How's it going?

<ICE-SIN:W1B-009#5:1>
Hope this finds you and Helmut well and happy and nice and warm.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-009#6:1>
Warm?

<ICE-SIN:W1B-009#7:1>
Yes, I'm sitting by my window right now, witnessing a spectacular
snowstorm outside.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-009#8:1>
It's nice and warm in my room - - well, what's warm and what's cold?

<ICE-SIN:W1B-009#9:1>
It's all relative.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-009#10:1>
It must be about 10* C now in my lovely heaterless room, which is
nice and warm compared to outside.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-009#11:1>
I can't guess what the temperature is outside.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-009#12:1>
Yes, it's wonderful to be back in Dharamsala, back where I really
feel most at home.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-009#13:1>
It's exactly 2 weeks now since I got back here, re-connecting with
old friends from my l-o-ng India road, and making new friends too.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-009#14:1>
My first week here the weather was cold and it snowed a bit on about
4 or 5 days, though nothing like today's incredible snowstorm.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-009#15:1>
Then the last one week the weather really turned warm and sunny &
very pleasant and people were saying it was the end of winter, that it would
be warming up from now on - ha, ha!

<ICE-SIN:W1B-009#16:1>
Yesterday there was a sudden change in the weather and last night was
so-o-o-o cold!

<ICE-SIN:W1B-009#17:1>
This morning I was supposed to go up the hill to Tushita for a
special teaching by a high lama at 9:30 but the weather was so bad and it was
so cold I couldn't even bear to crawl out of my sleeping bag and blankets.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-009#18:1>
It's 12 noon now and I've just finished breakfast in bed.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-009#19:1>
If this weather keeps up looks like I'll be marooned here in the
monastery for the rest of the day.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-009#20:1>
Great, just when I've run out of food too!

<ICE-SIN:W1B-009#21:1>
Actually this sudden change in the weather could be attributed to
none other than the Dalai Lama himself.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-009#22:1>
People say that whenever His Holiness gives a high-powered tantric
initiation the weather changes from warm to cold or vice versa.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-009#23:1>
Well, yesterday morning there was a big initiation which I attended
and then a couple of hours after it ended, huge dark clouds and a truly
horrific wind appeared out of nowhere.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-009#24:1>
I remember towards the end of the ceremony H.H.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-009#25:1>
said, " May the blessings of all the Boddhisattvas rain down upon you
like showers of falling snow." No kidding!

<ICE-SIN:W1B-009#26:1>
I didn't think he meant that literally!

<ICE-SIN:W1B-009#27:1>
I really hope this snow stops soon ( this is really getting serious
now!) I've got a few friends up at Tushita who are supposed to come back down
today, one of whom is this girl that, out of my boundless compassion, I lent
my very warm winter sleeping bag to, and she lent me her summer bag in
exchange ( since it's colder up there than here at the Nyingma Monastery).

<ICE-SIN:W1B-009#28:1>
What selflessness!

<ICE-SIN:W1B-009#29:1>
Also tomorrow I've got a specially arranged one-on-one with a
high-powered Geshe who people say is enlightened or almost enlightened.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-009#30:1>
The appointment is at the Centre for Tibetan Studies which is
normally half an hour's walk away.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-009#31:1>
It's an appointment I intend to keep even if I have to tunnel my way
through the snow.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-009#32:1>
Maybe this is a test of my courage and determination!

<ICE-SIN:W1B-009#33:1>
Well anyway I hope you're doing alright and behaving yourself ( I
gave up smoking on Losar 10 days ago - - a good idea with all these hills I
have to climb).

<ICE-SIN:W1B-009#34:1>
Say hi to Peter, Matthew, Peck Hoon, etc.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-009#35:1>
etc.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-009#36:1>
Take care.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-009#37:1>
Hope to hear from you sometime ( if I'm not buried under 6 feet of
snow!)

<ICE-SIN:W1B-009#38:1>
Love,

<ICE-SIN:W1B-009#39:1>

3/3/94

<ICE-SIN:W1B-009#41:2>
Dearest Dylan,

<ICE-SIN:W1B-009#42:2>
Yes, your letter certainly found me and Helmut very well, happy and
warm ( mm...!) ( even without the stark contrast with you).

<ICE-SIN:W1B-009#43:2>
Well, but what prompted me to write immediately after receiving your
letter is not to gloat but that I realised I'm not going to be in time to
wish you a very fulfilling 30th birthday - - esp.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-009#44:2>
in your spiritual path or whatever priority you may now have.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-009#45:2>
Well, quite a bit seems to have happened even though you haven't been
gone all that long.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-009#46:2>
First of all, Helmut and I progressed tremendously.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-009#47:2>
Well, the awakening process sure ain't a sudden leap.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-009#48:2>
There's always so mush to learn about oneself and about each other -
- endless possibilities to explore really.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-009#49:2>
Mm, I've sent Isabella a postcard to let her know that she can always
reach me even when you're not around.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-009#50:2>
Meanwhile, just 2 days after you left Singapore ( which was the same
day Peck Hoon took off to Bangkok), my dad had a heart attack.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-009#51:2>
It was an unprecedented attack and neither my mum nor I recognised
the symptoms - - my dad having breathing difficulties and in excruciating
pain, contorted facial muscles, etc.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-009#52:2>
Well maybe it's good that he's a man with such a high threshold for
pain normally, so that when he behaves so abnormally, we take notice.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-009#53:2>
Thankfully, he was sent to the Singapore General Hospital early
enough and the Coronary Care Unit is really surprisingly advanced and
efficient.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-009#54:2>
After the initial rather difficult spur of the moment decision about
letting him take a very powerful new drug called the Streptocanis ( ? ) , he
recovered miraculously fast and was discharged on the eve of Chinese New Year
and was only back for an angiogram. </I>

<I>

<ICE-SIN:W1B-009#55:3>
17/3/94

<ICE-SIN:W1B-009#56:3>
Well, I paid your mum a visit on the last days of Chinese New Year
and helped myself to your " 1984" - - I've always thought I had read it but
realised I hadn't.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-009#57:3>
Now it's finished and I must say that it is truly an amazingly
powerful book - - so gripping and terrifying - - especially after the twist
in the story of the old shopkeeper turning out to be a Thought Police and the
endless grilling.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-009#58:3>
God!

<ICE-SIN:W1B-009#59:3>
when the story started it was bleak enough, yet there was that hope
or at least a glimmer of hope - - but then it turned out to be just so
devastating.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-009#60:3>
I'm so disturbed - immersing myself in the book is just such an
experience!

<ICE-SIN:W1B-009#61:3>
Sorry I assumed you wouldn't mind my improper mode of " borrowing"
your book - - I'm still sure you don't.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-009#62:3>
Thanks for the good book - it'll be returned to you either upon your
return or request, along with " Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance".

<ICE-SIN:W1B-009#63:3>
It was quite a funny situation, while I was at your mum's place I
paged Helmut, who was meeting his mum ( I've met her once - - she's the kind
that easily takes to niceties and falsities and can't take the reality as
perceived by Helmut but lives in an illusory world), but as his mum was tired
and needed to retire to her place, which is an illegal residential church, he
was free to meet me at your mum's place.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-009#64:3>
However when he turned up, your cousin, a Kelvin and his girlfriend
had arrived too and I was introduced as your friend - - I just thought it was
a rather funny situation.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-009#65:3>
Told your mum about my dad's situation and found that not Too long
ago, an uncle of yours died from his 2nd attack which was very shortly after
the first.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-009#66:3>
It's really no joke.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-009#67:3>
Though my dad doesn't seem at all affected by that critical condition
which was only such a short while ago, it's worrying that he will go back to
his heavy smoking days as per normal, thus creating the conditions for the
2nd attack to erupt.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-009#68:3>
So far, I've been occasionally a nag to ask him to cut down on his 40
sticks a day to about 10 but not with very great success.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-009#69:3>
I never realised/ really understood why I wasn't keen on joining Peck
Hoon to Thailand especially when I'm forever so hard-up about trips.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-009#70:3>
Well, I would say now it's really karmic - - the link between my dad
and me, his only kid who can talk back at him but still loves him
affectionately despite his ultra strict and conservative personality.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-009#71:3>
Well, naturally, the trip with Pete to Mount Ophir was cancelled.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-009#72:3>
Meanwhile, just thought each trip always seems to bring about change
and usually very constructive ones.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-009#73:3>
Right after the trip to Malaysia with my parents, I started seeing
Helmut and right after my solo trip to Trikora Beach things really started
going between us - - it made me sure of how I felt for him.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-009#74:3>
Well, come end of March, I'm going up to Awana Chalet ( halfway up
Genting) with tennis friends ( including Stan) and come end of April, that's
the real treat - - Trikora with Helmut for a long weekend.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-009#75:3>
Mm, can't wait.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-009#76:3>
Love,

<ICE-SIN:W1B-009#77:3>

Dear Dylan,

<ICE-SIN:W1B-009#79:4>
Sorry that this card will arrive late and the somewhat " naughty"
reminder of time passing.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-009#80:4>
Anyway, have been extra, hyper busy with work 'cos projects for IE (
two of them) due around this crazy season.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-009#81:4>
Have to complete them by 12 March and IE exams happen on 15 March.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-009#82:4>
Mad, is it not?

<ICE-SIN:W1B-009#83:4>
Will know my posting to a more " permanent" school later this month.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-009#84:4>
So here's to another year of whatever you think/ conceive of/imagine
to be best/ most suitable for yourself and in whichever ashram, guesthouse,
hotel, motel that you may find yourself, have a great time!!

<ICE-SIN:W1B-009#85:4>
*Notice the picture shows only a half-moon.

20 Apr 94

<ICE-SIN:W1B-009#91:5>
Dear Dylan,

<ICE-SIN:W1B-009#92:5>
You are probably surprised that I've finally lifted up my pen.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-009#93:5>
I'm surprised too.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-009#94:5>
I just hope I have enough things to write about.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-009#95:5>
After all, my life ( if it can be called one) in boring old Singapore
scarcely seems worth the effort of pushing a pen to describe.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-009#96:5>
Especially compared to yours.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-009#97:5>
What with the near celebrity status, the synthesis of spiritual and
fleshly bliss, surely the mark of a high level of enlightenment, and romance
against the backdrop of legendary natural beauty.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-009#98:5>
As I said to Paul last night, SBC ought to buy your story.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-009#99:5>
If they have the budget to make use of it.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-009#100:5>
Me, well, I'm back at home, locked up in my little bedroom like a
voluntary prisoner, a victim of the merciless onslaught of the mass media,
drowning in the radio waves of stupefying inanity.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-009#101:5>
No, of course I'm not depressed.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-009#102:5>
If you think I sound so, you should have seen me as I was several
days ago.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-009#103:5>
Or last week, that night when I drank myself to sleep.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-009#104:5>
I had been living at the ISS for several weeks, busy first with a
project, and then with the last exams which finished a week and half ago.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-009#105:5>
After that was internship, so I came home.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-009#106:5>
I started work in what I call " soulless Shenton Way", where
sometimes the veneer of smartness and material affluence through which, to
me, spiritual hollowness so plainly shows, sinks me into despair.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-009#107:5>
I bury my head in my analysis work.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-009#108:5>
I read a quote from 2001, by HAL: " I'm using my capacity to the
fullest, what more could a rational being want?" Not very convincing, is it?

<ICE-SIN:W1B-009#109:5>
At home I had no work to distract me, and no money to go out.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-009#110:5>
But I had a bottle of whiskey.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-009#111:5>
Now even that is nearly gone.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-009#112:5>
( Come to think of it, that was from you wasn't it?) But I'm
recovering a little now.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-009#113:5>
Even picked up enough energy to keep calling a female classmate up.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-009#114:5>
And no, this time it's not married woman.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-009#115:5>
Ah, women indeed!

<ICE-SIN:W1B-009#116:5>
Perhaps I could do with a little advice too, O benign sage.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-009#117:5>
I hardly know what I am doing, except I know I crave female
companionship.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-009#118:5>
This woman, you'd probably think she's not my type.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-009#119:5>
But we get along OK.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-009#120:5>
She has the fascination in my eyes as an incomprehensible alien
species.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-009#121:5>
Not really materialistic, she lives entirely in the material world.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-009#122:5>
She embraces the common as perhaps a saint would embrace humanity.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-009#123:5>
She sometimes makes me feel a pedantic snob.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-009#124:5>
She has a lightness of spirit that carries her skipping all day
through the very hells that oppress my soul.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-009#125:5>
I mean the shopping centres. <X>

<ICE-SIN:W1B-009#X126:5>
Her slim body can ingest unbelievable amounts food, which she bids
me eat, though a fraction of what she takes is enough to make me grow even
fatter.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-009#X127:5>
Strange creature, huh, guru?

<ICE-SIN:W1B-009#X128:5>
What do you think, O Master, is this an angel or a demon?

<ICE-SIN:W1B-009#X129:5>
Benightedly yours,

<ICE-SIN:W1B-009#X130:5>
Peter

<ICE-SIN:W1B-009#X131:5>
