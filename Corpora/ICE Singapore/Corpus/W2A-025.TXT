<h> THE CONCISE FLORA OF SINGAPORE - GYMNOSPERMS AND DICOTYLEDONS </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-025#2:1>
<h> INTRODUCTION </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-025#3:1>
Singapore consists of a transversely rhomboid main island of slightly
over 570 sq km and more than 50 smaller adjacent islands and islets of
various sizes.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-025#4:1>
Three largest adjacent islands are: Pulau Tekong Besar ( 17.5 sq km),
Pulau Ubin ( 10.1 sq km) and Pulau Sentosa ( 3.5 sq km).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-025#5:1>
Some of these islands and islets have been enlarged by reclamation in
recent years, as has the main island ( Tan 1987).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-025#6:1>
Singapore is located between latitude 1&degree;09' N and 1&degree;29' N.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-025#7:1>
The climate, as expected, is equatorial and is characterized by high
temperatures, a large amount of rainfall and high humidity.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-025#8:1>
The average daily maximum temperature is 30.7&degree;C which occurs in the
afternoon, and minimum of 23&degree;C shortly before dawn.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-025#9:1>
The average annual rainfall is 2,370 mm, distributed throughout the
year.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-025#10:1>
Relative humidity often exceeds 90 per cent at night and in the early
morning, and is between 65-70 per cent in the dry afternoon.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-025#11:1>
The presence of the southeast Asian monsoon winds breaks the somewhat
seasonal uniformity ( Nieuwolt 1973).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-025#12:1>
November to January, during the northwest monsoon is slightly cooler
and with higher rainfall.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-025#13:1>
While May to August, during the southeast monsoon, on the other hand,
usually is hotter and with lower rainfall.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-025#14:1>
Geologically, the island of Singapore is composed of two basic types
of rocks, namely sedimentary and igneous.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-025#15:1>
The ancient sedimentary rocks of the Triassic Jurassic period in the
forms of shale, sandstone and conglomerate, occur in the western and southern
parts of the island.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-025#16:1>
Granite and associated igneous rocks of post-Jurassic period are
found in the central and northern, and also in the northeastern parts of the
island.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-025#17:1>
Semi-hardened 'Old alluvium' of early Pleistocene age, which consists
of coarse sands with clay and well-rounded pebbles and boulders, covers much
of eastern Singapore.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-025#18:1>
Recent sediments form a thin layer in isolated patches spreading over
much of the coastal area and in river valleys and lowlands ( Hill 1973).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-025#19:1>
The highest point is at the peak of Bukit Timah ( 165 m) which is
near the centre of the main island, and like its surrounding hills, is formed
by granite.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-025#20:1>
It is generally conceived that the island of Singapore was originally
covered with dense lowland rain forests except along its muddy estuaries and
sandy stretches in the coastal areas ( Ridley 1900).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-025#21:1>
Shortly after the arrival of Sir Stamford Raffles in 1819, J
Crawfurd, in 1829, witnessed that the island had the unvarying aspect of one
continuous forest with no marked elevation from a distance ( Burkill 1959).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-025#22:1>
Barely 70 years later, Ridley ( 1900) reported that a great deal of
the forest was felled, partly for the value of the timber and partly for
cultivation of several introduced crops of economic importance.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-025#23:1>
These included nutmeg, cloves, cocoa, coffee, pepper, gambier (
Uncaria gambir), etc.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-025#24:1>
Owing either to serious plant diseases ( eg nutmeg blight and coffee
leaf rust), or to the exhaustion of soils ( eg the result of gambier
cultivation) or other reasons, a large portion of this cleared ground was
later abandoned and became covered with lalang ( Imperata cvlindrica) and
other grasses and sedges.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-025#25:1>
Every year some primary forests disappeared and more wastelands were
created.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-025#26:1>
The indigenous flora was extensively and severely damaged during the
second half of the nineteenth and the beginning of this century.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-025#27:1>
With the gradual process of improvement of the physical and chemical
properties of the depleted soil, a succession of plants - first herbs and
shrubs and then trees - were slowly established.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-025#28:1>
A common type of secondary forest, locally called Adinandra belukar (
Holttum 1954), with Adinandra dumosa of the Theaceae as the dominant tree
species, developed.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-025#29:1>
As populations keep expanding, land utilisation becomes more
intensive.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-025#30:1>
Rapid progress has been made during the last two decades (
1960s-80s), especially, in urbanisation and industrialisation.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-025#31:1>
Many of the new towns and factories were built upon the land once
covered with lallang or by secondary forests.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-025#32:1>
Mangrove forests at Kranji and Ulu Pandan were partly or totally
cleared respectively.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-025#33:1>
Only a few areas in Singapore have never been cleared for cultivation
and thus more or less retain the original primary forest.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-025#34:1>
The most notable one is the Bukit Timah forest.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-025#35:1>
It was on the recommendation of NC Cantley in 1882, then
Superintendent of the Singapore Botanic Gardens, that several forest reserves
were demarcated on the island over the next few years.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-025#36:1>
Bukit Timah was the first forest reserve that was established as
early as 1883 ( Burkid, 1959).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-025#37:1>
The Nature Reserves Ordinance was passed in 1951, and in 1971, the
Nature Reserves Act came into being.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-025#38:1>
The Nature Reserves Board is charged with the responsibility of
preserving the natural fauna and flora within the reserves.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-025#39:1>
The total area of the reserves at present according to the Annual
Report, Ministry of National Development, 1984, is estimated at about 2000
ha.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-025#40:1>
The maintenance and upkeep of the Bukit Timah Nature Reserve and
Labrador Park comes under the administration of the Parks and Recreations
Department.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-025#41:1>
The central Water Catchment Area, which is the largest nature
reserve, is maintained by the Public Utilities Board.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-025#42:1>
Since the island of Singapore is separated from the Malay Peninsula
merely by the narrow Straits of Johor, the flora of Singapore naturally is an
extension of that of the southern part of the Peninsula.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-025#43:1>
The first list of the seed plants of Singapore and adjacent islands,
entitled 'The Flora of Singapore', was compiled by Ridley ( 1900).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-025#44:1>
Supplementary notes appeared one year later ( Ridley 1901).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-025#45:1>
Subsequently, two separate lists entitled 'List of Dicotyledons in
Syonan' and 'List of Monocotyledons in Syonan' were compiled by the staff of
the Botanical Gardens, Singapore, during the Japanese Occupation ( 1942-45).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-025#46:1>
These two latter lists were never published, but the typed
manuscripts were preserved in the Gardens.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-025#47:1>
'An Annotated List of Seed Plants of Singapore' has been compiled by
the present author and published in instalments in the Gardens' Bulletin,
Singapore.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-025#48:1>
The first ten parts ( Keng 1973-86) cover the Gymnosperms and
Dicotyledons native to and commonly found in Singapore.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-025#49:1>
It forms the nucleus of the present book, although numerous additions
and corrections are incorporated, brief family descriptions are added, and
several parts have been rewritten.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-025#50:1>
Manuscript for the companion volume on Monocotyledons is planned to
be ready in few years' time.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-025#51:1>
A computation of the plants listed in this volume yields the
following preliminary results.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-025#52:1>
Apart from the commonly cultivated and naturalised plants, there are
3 families, 3 genera and 8 species of Gymnosperms, and 125 families, 574
genera and 1,285 species of Dicotyledons native to Singapore.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-025#53:1>
A fuller picture will emerge when the enumeration of Monocotyledons
is completed.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-025#54:1>
Nevertheless, in view of the small size of the island, the flora must
be considered as among the richest in the world.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-025#55:1>
The 10 largest dicotyledonous families in Singapore in the order of
their sizes ( that is, the number of species) are as follows. <X>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-025#X56:1>
Families No.of Genera No.of Species Rubiaceae 41 125 Euphorbiaceae
37 109 Leguminosae 30 66 Moraceae 5 59 Annonaceae 20 55 Lauraceae 12 42
Myrtaceae 6 41 Melastomataceae 12 32 Apocynaceae 17 31 Verbenaceae 11 26 </X>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-025#57:1>
Some of the largest genera are: Ficus ( Moraceae), 43 species;
Eugenia ( Myrtaceae), 35 species; Calophyllum ( Guttiferae), 17 species;
Baccaurea ( Euphorbiaceae), 14 species; Elaeocarpus ( Tiliaceae), 14 species;
Lasianthus ( Rubiaceae), 13 species; and Piper ( Piperaceae), 13 species.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-025#58:1>
Ridley ( 1900) in his enumeration Singapore plants marked 12 species
of dicotyledons with asterisks as endemic to Singapore.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-025#59:1>
He, however, clearly pointed out that some of these species are
either dubious ( eg Embelia lucida Wall., and Salacia lobbii Laws.) or
probably erroneously recorded in Singapore ( eg Uvaria subrependa wall).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-025#60:1>
In going through the recent literature, it becomes clear that some of
these 'endemic' species are synonyms of species of much wider distribution (
eg Lophopetalum fuscescens Kun = L javanicum Turcz), others are also found
elsewhere ( eg Xylopia ridleyi King = Cyathocalyx ridleyi Sinclair).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-025#61:1>
In our present knowledge, only Polyosma kingiana Schltr.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-025#62:1>
( Saxifragaceae), Sabia erratica PM vd Water ( Sabiaceae) and a few
other species, are probably endemic.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-025#63:1>
There is no endemic genus.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-025#64:1>
Several explanatory notes should be made here.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-025#65:1>
Firstly, it is intended to bring the nomenclature of the plant names
given in this volume up to date as far as possible.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-025#66:1>
Several regional floras ( eg Backer and Bakhuizen f, 1963, 65 and 68;
Whitmore 1972 and 73 and Ng 1978 and 89) and numerous monographs and
revisions were consulted.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-025#67:1>
Admittedly, a number of the new names may have been overlooked.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-025#68:1>
Some of them, however, are cited as alternative names, others are not
accepted.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-025#69:1>
Secondly, native and introduced plants are differentiated in such a
way that native ones are printed in bold face, and introduced one, in
italics.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-025#70:1>
Native plants are those presumably indigenous to Singapore and they
have existed here since before the arrival of Sir Stamford Raffles or much
earlier.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-025#71:1>
Introduced ones were brought into the island by artificial means,
either intentionally or unintentionally.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-025#72:1>
However, their difference is not always clear, especially in case of
some weedy species.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-025#73:1>
In general, Ridley's discretion in his Floras of Singapore ( 1900)
and of the Malay Peninsula ( 1922-25) is largely followed.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-025#74:1>
Native species usually bear a collection number of the herbanum
specimen, which is in the collection of the Botanic Gardens, Singapore.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-025#75:1>
Many of these specimens are of historical value.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-025#76:1>
Thirdly, it is not possible, nor necessary to record all cultivated
plants.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-025#77:1>
For example, in the beginning of this century, a large number of
Gymnosperms were cultivated in Singapore ( Anderson 1912).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-025#78:1>
Some of them survived to this day, others ( eg Bowenia, Ceratozamia,
Stangeria of Cycadales, and Cephalotaxus, Sciadopitys, Thujopsis of the
Conifer disappeared a long time ago.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-025#79:1>
Exotic plants, if they cannot reproduce vegetatively or by producing
seeds, naturally will become extinct in a matter of time.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-025#80:1>
Fourthly, new plants are still making their way to Singapore.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-025#81:1>
A fine example is following the recent reclamation work, a host of
weedy species found their w the island.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-025#82:1>
Some of them, eg Neptunia plena ( L.) Benth and Mimosa pigra L are so
flourishing that they are likely to make Singapore their permanent home.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-025#83:1>
Fifthly, the arrangement of the families follows the sequence given
in 'Orders Families of Malayan Seed Plants' ( Keng 1983).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-025#84:1>
Finally a note concerning the keys to families, genera and species
follows.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-025#85:1>
Separate keys to the families of Gymnosperms and Dicotyledons which
adapted from 'Orders and Families of Malayan Seed Plants' ( Keng 1983), with
modifications, are included.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-025#86:1>
For the families comprising two or more genera, keys to the genera
are added.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-025#87:1>
In the very large families ( eg Legumino Euphorbiaceae, Compositae,
etc.), only synoptic keys are provided.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-025#88:1>
Keys to species, regretfully are left out.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-025#89:1>
One of the main concerns is the very considerable length involved.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-025#90:1>
Besides, many useful keys to species are available in regic
literature.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-025#91:1>
For instance, keys to the species of most woody genera, including
very large ones such as Ficus ( with about 43 species in Singapore), Eugenia
( ab 35 species), Calophyllum ( about 17 species), etc., can be found in sepa
volumes of 'Tree Flora of Malaya' ( Whitmore 1972, 1973, and Ng 1978, 1989).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-025#92:1>
Revisions or monographs of various families such as Annonaceae (
Sinclair 1955) Myristicaceae ( Sinclair 195 8), etc.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-025#93:1>
also contain keys to species of different genera.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-025#94:1>
In addition, keys to species of common herbaceous and woody plants
can found in the following two immensely popular books respectively: 'Malaya
Wild Flowers' ( Henderson 1954) and 'Wayside Trees of Malaya' ( Corner 1988).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-025#95:1>
In latter book, excellent keys to the commonly cultivated genera ( eg
Cassia, Ixora etc.) are also included.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-025#96:1>
For the smaller genera of two or three species, brief notes on some
of the diagnostic characters are, nevertheless, mentioned under the species
in this concise flora.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-025#97:1>
<h> DICOTYLEDONS </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-025#98:1>
The dicotyledonous plants usually have their flower parts in fours or
fives, or multiple of these numbers.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-025#99:1>
Their leaves are usually net-veined.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-025#100:1>
Their stems are always with cylindrical vascular tissues and a
prominent cambium which produces the secondary tissues.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-025#101:1>
Traditionally they are classified under a class or subclass,
Dicotyledoneae, which together with Monocotyledoneae, constitutes the
flowering plants or Angiospermae.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-025#102:1>
<h> MAGNOLIACEAE </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-025#103:1>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-025#105:1>
Flowers usually bisexual, solitary and regular; floral parts
generally free and spirally arranged.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-025#106:1>
