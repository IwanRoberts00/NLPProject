Straits Times interview with S. Dhanabalan

<ICE-SIN:W2C-001#2:1>
02-04-93 <h> Structure of economy stabilised; hollowing-out unlikely
in S'pore </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2C-001#3:1>
By Chan Hwa Loon

<ICE-SIN:W2C-001#4:1>
THE structure of the Singapore economy has stabilised and the relative
sizes of the major sectors should not change drastically from their present
levels.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-001#5:1>
This was the assessment of Trade and Industry Minister S Dhanabalan,
who said in an interview on Tuesday that the kind of " hollowing out" of
industries seen in Hongkong was not likely to take place here.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-001#6:1>
In the long term, the share of manufacturing in the economy should be
between Switzerland's 25% and Japan's 28%.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-001#7:1>
Manufacturing makes up about 27 per cent of Singapore's Gross Domestic
Product today, compared to about 10 % in the 1960s.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-001#8:1>
On suggestions of hollowing out Mr Dhanabalan said that so far
applications for industrial land and Jurong Town Corporation ( JTC)
factories, as well as the number of retrenchments did not indicate that it
was happening.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-001#9:1>
He added that the drop in JTC factory tenants was due mainly to large
tenants moving out into their own premises, rather than companies pulling out
of Singapore.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-001#10:1>
Last week, JTC released the occupancy rate for its flatted factories,
which showed a fall to 94 % last year from 99 % in 1991.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-001#11:1>
In his view, the commerce sector may decline in relative terms, with
the financial and business services sector picking up the slack.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-001#12:1>
However the Government is not targeting any sector for growth at the
expense of others.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-001#13:1>
Nor is it forcing Singaporeans to venture abroad.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-001#14:1>
What the Government is trying to do is to draw attention to the
opportunities overseas and remove impediments to venturing abroad.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-001#15:1>
On the ideal size of Singapore's external economy, he said the
Government has not set any targets.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-001#16:1>
But as Singapore's stock of private foreign direct investments was
only 12 % of Gross National Product, compared to Switzerland's 30 %, " there
is room for us to improve".

<ICE-SIN:W2C-001#17:1>
While economic upgrading and regionalisation were complementary, he
was concerned that the structural changes should not happen so fast that
people could not cope with them.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-001#18:1>
Government incentives should at best be neutral and not make overseas
investment more attractive than local investment, as higher wages were
already putting steady pressure on companies to upgrade.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-001#19:1>
Local businessmen have not been slow in venturing into Vietnam
SINGAPORE businessmen have not been slow in venturing into Vietnam although
figures show that others appear to have stolen a march on them, said Trade
and Industry Minister S.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-001#20:1>
Dhanabalan.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-001#21:1>
In an interview with The Straits Times, Mr Dhanabalan said many small
Singapore investors in Vietnam are not captured in the statistics.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-001#22:1>
" These people like to do things quietly.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-001#23:1>
And as somebody said, these people have found the honey pot and why
should they go round broadcasting it to everybody else.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-001#24:1>
The fact that we don't have complete figures doesn't worry me," he
said.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-001#25:1>
According to Vietnamese data, Singaporeans have invested in 24
projects there last year worth about US&dollar;110 million ( S&dollar;176 million).

<ICE-SIN:W2C-001#26:1>
Investments worth another US&dollar;500 million are awaiting approval.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-001#27:1>
Although Singapore is the 11th largest foreign investor in Vietnam,
it is still ahead of neighbouring countries including Thailand, which had
said it wanted to see Indo-china as its market.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-001#28:1>
Some big Singapore companies like Straits Steamship, Keppel,
Asia-Pacific Breweries have already gained a foothold there.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-001#29:1>
" People are already going there.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-001#30:1>
It doesn't have to be centrally controlled, directed and restricted.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-001#31:1>
That is not the way our economy develops," he said.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-001#32:1>
On the trade front, Singapore is Vietnam's largest trading partner.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-001#33:1>
Total two-way trade amounted to about S&dollar;l.7 billion last year.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-001#34:1>
Mr Dhanabalan said that although Vietnam was not as big as China, it
would become an important market for Singapore investors and traders. </I>

<h> Private firms, 'not stat boards, must lead overseas investments'
</h>

<ICE-SIN:W2C-001#36:2>
By Chan Hwa Loon

<ICE-SIN:W2C-001#37:2>
The function of spearheading overseas investment should not be
foisted on statutory boards, said Trade and Industry Minister S.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-001#38:2>
Dhanabalan.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-001#39:2>
He said on Tuesday that government bodies are not set up to perform
that role.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-001#40:2>
They should let the private sector negotiate deals overseas, and
provide " technical backup" when needed.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-001#41:2>
It would be " putting things the wrong way round' if the government
bodies were the ones to assess the risks of a deal.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-001#42:2>
" It would be a mistake for them to do so, as they do not have the
expertise for that," he said.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-001#43:2>
He noted that statutory boards have come to know many local suppliers
and contractors over the years.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-001#44:2>
'They can and should help these people, if they want help, to do
business elsewhere," he said.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-001#45:2>
Giving an example, he said a contractor who had done work for the
Port of Singapore Authority ( PSA) could use those credentials to try to win
an overseas project, and even draw on PSA's expertise if necessary.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-001#46:2>
Government bodies should change their present attitude that it was
not their business to help local companies obtain deals abroad.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-001#47:2>
But they should not be expected to go overseas and secure business to
give to local firms as they are not equipped to do so.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-001#48:2>
He said a successful example of Government-private sector
co-operation is Jurong Town Corporation's investment in a Thai industrial
estate together with the private sector.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-001#49:2>
Mr Dhanabalan's comments came amid a nationwide discussion on the
need for the economy to sprout a second wing.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-001#50:2>
Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew recently said that statutory boards,
Government-linked companies ( GLCs) and private firms need to pool their
resources to succeed abroad.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-001#51:2>
He said they have to trust each other and share information on the
region.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-001#52:2>
Private-sector companies have complained to him that statutory boards
and GLCs held them at arm's length and were unhappy at the prospect of
partnering Singapore entrepreneurs of questionable reputation.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-001#53:2>
Tuesday's 90-minute interview was Mr Dhanabalan's first with the
press since he took over Brigadier General ( Res) Lee Hsien Loong's Trade and
Industry portfolio last December.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-001#54:2>
He is standing in for the Deputy Prime Minister, who had been
undergoing chemotherapy for cancer.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-001#55:2>
Mr Dhanabalan also disclosed in the interview that the Committee to
Promote Enterprise Overseas, chaired by Minister of State ( Finance and
Communications) Commodore ( Res) Teo Chee Hean, would be looking further into
the role of government bodies in regionalisation efforts.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-001#56:2>
He said the Government would like to change the mentality of
bureaucrats and the small and medium sized enterprises ( SMEs) so that they
can work better together.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-001#57:2>
Noting that SMEs often find bureaucrats unsympathetic, Mr Dhanabalan
said this was untrue as the Government has given them a lot of assistance "
They expect the Government to just scatter money but the Government can't do
that.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-001#58:2>
It has to insist on proper assessment of business proposals.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-001#59:2>
" The businessman can put his own money on a hunch but if he is asked
to justify and quantify his hunch, he gets upset.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-001#60:2>
If that is so, then nothing can be changed," he said.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-001#61:2>
In contrast, the GLCs were more like private firms and should not be
put in the same category as statutory boards and other government bodies.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-001#62:2>
They have been successful so far because the Government does not
interfere with them. </I>

The Straits Time interview with S. Dhanabalan

<ICE-SIN:W2C-001#64:3>
<h> Asean countries will lose their credibility if Afta fails </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2C-001#65:3>
Singapore will be involved in any move that will mean greater access
to markets

<ICE-SIN:W2C-001#66:3>
by Chan Hwa Loon

<ICE-SIN:W2C-001#67:3>
THE Asean countries would lose their credibility if the Asean Free
Trade Area ( Afta) fails and becomes another version of the moribund
Preferential Trading Arrangement, said Mr S. Dhanabalan.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-001#68:3>
The Trade and Industry Minister said in an interview on Tuesday that
the schedules put up by the Asean countries to implement Afta were " a little
different" from expected.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-001#69:3>
But he felt that the end point would still be the same - - that under
the fast track, the tariffs would be reduced to a minimum of 5 per cent in
seven to 10 years, and under the normal track, in 10 to 15 years.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-001#70:3>
Even as Singapore rolls back its tariffs under Afta, it is prepared
to join other free trade areas if conditions are right and if they are not
inward-looking.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-001#71:3>
'We want to be involved in any move that will mean greater access to
markets.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-001#72:3>
Nafta, the North American Free Trade Agreement, would be the nearest
potential free trade area but nothing has moved yet.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-001#73:3>
He noted that although Afta's progress was slow, the Asean countries
had made a start and Asean leaders have come a long way in recognising that
Afta cannot afford to fail.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-001#74:3>
Mr Dhanabalan said he would " wait and see", as it was " still a bit
early in the day" to pass judgment on Afta.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-001#75:3>
In his view, Afta is not significant enough yet to make Asean a
competitive destination for foreign investments.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-001#76:3>
Tuesday's 90-minute interview - - which covered issues ranging from
the Singapore economy to regionalisation efforts - - was Mr Dhanabalan's
first with the press since he took over the Trade and Industry portfolio last
December from Brig-Gen ( Res) Lee Hsien Loong.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-001#77:3>
On protectionism, most people still remembered the 1930s when world
trade contracted tremendously because of trade barriers.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-001#78:3>
But there are fears among analysts that the baby boom generation in
the US did not have memories of what happened then and may resort to tariff
barriers to solve their present economic problems.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-001#79:3>
If they do that, " they will very soon find that they are severely
burnt" as even regional trading blocs like Nafta and the European Community (
EC) had strong trade links with other economies.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-001#80:3>
" So, they must face up to the consequence of a significant part, or
maybe a greater part, of their trade being affected if they become too
inward-looking."

<ICE-SIN:W2C-001#81:3>
Mr Dhanabalan added: " I see that as a kind of a natural safety
factor against an inward-looking trend.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-001#82:3>
But this of course presumes that people work and think logically and
rationally.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-001#83:3>
" Sometimes the hard reality of logic can be diverted by immediate
political pressures."

<ICE-SIN:W2C-001#84:3>
Growth of Chinese market need not be at expense of other areas

<ICE-SIN:W2C-001#85:3>
THE liberalisation and growth of the Chinese market is not a zero sum
game and would not be at the expense of other areas such as the Growth
Triangle, said Trade and Industry Minister S. Dhanabalan.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-001#86:3>
Mr Dhanabalan said in an interview with The Straits Times on Tuesday
that although China is a large country with vast resources, it is not a
self-contained economy.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-001#87:3>
Hence, as the country grows its relationship with the world will also
grow and it does not mean that foreign companies would stop investing
elsewhere.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-001#88:3>
The minister was responding to a point made by some economists that
the Growth Triangle, covering Singapore, Johor and Indonesia's Riau region,
would become less attractive to investors as a result of the investment boom
in south China - - if nothing is done to accelerate the project.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-001#89:3>
Mr Dhanabalan said that Batam, one leg of the triangle, is attractive
to investors because it can ride on Singapore's infrastructure.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-001#90:3>
Local investors who go to Batam may not be competing in the same end
market as those going to China.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-001#91:3>
And even if they are, other factors like consistency and certainty of
policies, undertakings and commitments would set the two apart.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-001#92:3>
" Certainly, many companies here have more experience in Indonesia
than in China," he said.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-001#93:3>
Republic 'must watch developments in Japan and EC carefully'
SINGAPORE would have to watch developments in Japan and the European
Community carefully as the impact of their economic slowdown has not been
felt here, said Mr S Dhanabalan.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-001#94:3>
The Trade and Industry Minister said this in an interview on Tuesday
in reply to a question on whether he thought the effects of the European and
Japanese recession have trickled down to Singapore.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-001#95:3>
Mr Dhanabalan said that so far Singapore has avoided being hard hit
by adverse conditions abroad because it managed to stay competitive.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-001#96:3>
The most competitive products would be the last to be cut back in an
economic slowdown and the first to experience an increase in demand when the
economy recovers.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-001#97:3>
In the

<ICE-SIN:W2C-001#98:3>
past, before recessions in these countries could affect Singapore
their economies had started to pick up again. <X>

<ICE-SIN:W2C-001#X99:3>
Said Mr Dhanabalan, " This underscores the need for us to be very
careful about our competitiveness.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-001#X100:3>
We must never reach the point where our exports would be among the
first to be cut off in a recession." </X> </I>
