<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-033#1:1:A>
What I like to do now is to take you through from the world of
uh the literary uh

<ICE-SIN:S2A-033#2:1:A>
You know from authorship to the fairly realistic pragmatic world and
uh basically what I'll like to talk about is bridging the world between uh
you know where authors are books the creative uh industry with you know uh
earning your bread and butter and getting that done

<ICE-SIN:S2A-033#3:1:A>
Uh so being quite consistent with Singapore's thrust towards
entrepreneurship uh in a pushing towards uh you know enterprise uh at the
same time

<ICE-SIN:S2A-033#4:1:A>
Now first of all about the book itself

<ICE-SIN:S2A-033#5:1:A>
The travels of Wiglinton and Wenks are really to help promote
educational values among the children who are reading it particularly
geography

<ICE-SIN:S2A-033#6:1:A>
So the first four books of the series cover the first book is on
London and Paris

<ICE-SIN:S2A-033#7:1:A>
Alright so it covers the uh travel taste of uh the adventures of Wi
Wiglinton and Wenks in London and Paris

<ICE-SIN:S2A-033#8:1:A>
The next one is on Venice and Rome

<ICE-SIN:S2A-033#9:1:A>
The third one is one is on Istanbul and Turkey and the fourth is
Malta and Singapore and the fifth will be on China called the China doll

<ICE-SIN:S2A-033#10:1:A>
And the reason why I'm covering uh these various countries with you
is it because if you can find a programme or a book that uh you know provides
you with uh opportunities on travel this would be a lovely business to be in
and that's the business

<ICE-SIN:S2A-033#11:1:A>
We're in because in anyway in order for us to be able to the the
books and to have them uh drawn all three of us have got to travel uh and do
research

<ICE-SIN:S2A-033#12:1:A>
So the first thing about bridging worlds uh in terms of writing is
the fact that you've got to go into research which is partly you know facts

<ICE-SIN:S2A-033#13:1:A>
That's what faction is all about in you know

<ICE-SIN:S2A-033#14:1:A>
In whatever documents you come up with whatever books or essays you
intent to write and have to write you've got to do the fundamental research

<ICE-SIN:S2A-033#15:1:A>
And in this case it is really pleasurable because you've got to go
visit the countries and the cities

<ICE-SIN:S2A-033#16:1:A>
And you've got to get the very good feel of uh the facts and you've
got to get them right

<ICE-SIN:S2A-033#17:1:A>
Because otherwise you know children will be picking up all the
inaccurate information

<ICE-SIN:S2A-033#18:1:A>
So let's put it this way

<ICE-SIN:S2A-033#19:1:A>
The reason why it is uh geared for six to a hundred is because if
you've never been to Turkey and uh you've not been to Istanbul

<ICE-SIN:S2A-033#20:1:A>
If you were to read the book you would get very good facts about
the culture of the countries that you're uh that the books are all about

<ICE-SIN:S2A-033#21:1:A>
You'll get lovely illustrations of uh some of the major uh things
which are in the city and the country

<ICE-SIN:S2A-033#22:1:A>
So the research is really to provide stimulus for writing because
you can't live in a isolation

<ICE-SIN:S2A-033#23:1:A>
If I were to put you a square box in a room on your own and expect
you create out of nothing

<ICE-SIN:S2A-033#24:1:A>
It's is often very difficult

<ICE-SIN:S2A-033#25:1:A>
Uh on the other hand by interacting with people by being here for
instance and having spend a week uh talking to your peers and talking to
speakers

<ICE-SIN:S2A-033#26:1:A>
Perhaps and having an exchange you get the stimulus you need often
to get your work done

<ICE-SIN:S2A-033#27:1:A>
Secondly nothing uh you know it's better than getting a feel of
this of the situation

<ICE-SIN:S2A-033#28:1:A>
If you're writing about uh in a cultures about people uh there is
nothing more im important than getting a feel of the situation the climate

<ICE-SIN:S2A-033#29:1:A>
What are the attitudes like you know

<ICE-SIN:S2A-033#30:1:A>
How do people feel about the country

<ICE-SIN:S2A-033#31:1:A>
How do they feel in terms of uh the the kind of celebrations that
they have and what's the joy they get uh in these places

<ICE-SIN:S2A-033#32:1:A>
Or perhaps some of the problems that they're experiencing

<ICE-SIN:S2A-033#33:1:A>
The third of course is to make it authentic because one of the key
things about writing uh and about you know function is you got to provide a
certain basis for which people can identify with with the the things which
are being done

<ICE-SIN:S2A-033#34:1:A>
So it's a very nice uh fin final balance between reading a book for
instance the book on Turkey

<ICE-SIN:S2A-033#35:1:A>
If a Turk uh were to read it and uh for instance the ambassador of
Turkey were to read this book

<ICE-SIN:S2A-033#36:1:A>
He should be able to say yes it is quite accurate it is quite
authentic uh there's no thrill you know uh uhm bull-shiting around with the
facts

<ICE-SIN:S2A-033#37:1:A>
However one of the key things also is you got to realise that if
you're writing children's books you are actually writing also the positive
side

<ICE-SIN:S2A-033#38:1:A>
So one of the key things you might say to yourself is that if
you've got nothing really nice to say about something don't say it

<ICE-SIN:S2A-033#39:1:A>
Now that's the position of censorship which I think is interesting
given this audience

<ICE-SIN:S2A-033#40:1:A>
Because I'm sure one can go into a debate about whether censorship
uh you know is right or wrong

<ICE-SIN:S2A-033#41:1:A>
I realise you've had Irene Ng from the the Straits Times before as
a speaker

<ICE-SIN:S2A-033#42:1:A>
I don't know what she's covered but uh you know people would I
think think in terms of what is the role of censorship or self censorship in
a country uh like ours

<ICE-SIN:S2A-033#43:1:A>
And one of the key things I would say is this that if you are
looking into writing about cross-cultures you've got to be responsible

<ICE-SIN:S2A-033#44:1:A>
And when I talk about responsible authorship I'm saying you have to
be sensitive about the multi-right racial elements in any societies

<ICE-SIN:S2A-033#45:1:A>
Uh they're other countries with different religions

<ICE-SIN:S2A-033#46:1:A>
You've got the multireligious states

<ICE-SIN:S2A-033#47:1:A>
You have also got a a lot of different cultures

<ICE-SIN:S2A-033#48:1:A>
And because of this sensitivities you've got to I think be
responsible which means sometimes you've got tell yourself that uh you know
if you have nothing nice about it don't say it

<ICE-SIN:S2A-033#49:1:A>
Uh and you know uh do that

<ICE-SIN:S2A-033#50:1:A>
And you've also got to bear in mind that the product meets the
objectives and reinforces the value you are trying to promote

<ICE-SIN:S2A-033#51:1:A>
For example if you look at uh what's happening in Turkey Turkey is
essentially uh uh Islamic country

<ICE-SIN:S2A-033#52:1:A>
I mean Islam is the major uh you know religion in Turkey

<ICE-SIN:S2A-033#53:1:A>
So you've got to be very careful in the way you protray the mosque

<ICE-SIN:S2A-033#54:1:A>
Make sure that they're accurate

<ICE-SIN:S2A-033#55:1:A>
Make sure that uh you know you give enough uhm uhm recognition to
uh you know the uhm religion uh of the countries

<ICE-SIN:S2A-033#56:1:A>
Uh in Maltar which is very very Catholic you'll find lots of
illustrations about you know Catholicism the cathedrals the festives and the
festivals that they celebrate

<ICE-SIN:S2A-033#57:1:A>
Similarly in Rome you've got vatican so you cover that as well

<ICE-SIN:S2A-033#58:1:A>
And I'm saying that when you're dealing with sensitive uh issues on
religion and races and the different cultures you've got to be very wary

<ICE-SIN:S2A-033#59:1:A>
In Singapore for instane you see uh one of the sketches about
Rajagopal

<ICE-SIN:S2A-033#60:1:A>
Now Rajagopal is called the wise one and he's the one in little
India who helps Wiglinton and Wenks uh find out where the clue to the next
map in Singapore is

<ICE-SIN:S2A-033#61:1:A>
And in Singapore because of the multi-racial system you will find
that in the book uh you we've represented all the races

<ICE-SIN:S2A-033#62:1:A>
You've got the Chinese you know you got the Eurasian manager of the
Orchid factory

<ICE-SIN:S2A-033#63:1:A>
You've also got the uhm you know uh Malay inspector who help them
to interpret the clue

<ICE-SIN:S2A-033#64:1:A>
So these are all some of the things you have to bear in mind when
you are writing for the world stage

<ICE-SIN:S2A-033#65:1:A>
And I think the important thing to bear in mind is this

<ICE-SIN:S2A-033#66:1:A>
The justification I think for self-censorship is really to look at
what is the objective you are trying to achieve

<ICE-SIN:S2A-033#67:1:A>
And may if you're going to write on something else you know
something different uh you may uh then decide to be less strict with yourself
as far as that's concern

<ICE-SIN:S2A-033#68:1:A>
But I think given the kind of objectives that you are trying to to
move in the product and the kind of values you're gonna try and promote in in
terms of uh you know green heritage uh preservation non-violence

<ICE-SIN:S2A-033#69:1:A>
These are some of the things that you got to bear in mind when
you're writing

<ICE-SIN:S2A-033#70:1:A>
And I welcome questions and we all welcome questions after this on
on the point of uh contention I think

<ICE-SIN:S2A-033#71:1:A>
Right coming back to bridges

<ICE-SIN:S2A-033#72:1:A>
I think one of the key things uh in taking this dimension of uh the
programmme further is to take a look at the products and the services that
you will be producing

<ICE-SIN:S2A-033#73:1:A>
For example many of you will be writing short story

<ICE-SIN:S2A-033#74:1:A>
Hopefully you would like to publish your own books one day or even
publish uh script for a play

<ICE-SIN:S2A-033#75:1:A>
One of the thing you got to then uhm begin to bridge is the
literary world of the author with the world of commerce which is the reader
which is how do you get your product which is the book or the play and the
service which is educational one assumes or exposure of stimulus

<ICE-SIN:S2A-033#76:1:A>
Whatever it is uh that you define as the objective to the end
reader is the end user or the consumer

<ICE-SIN:S2A-033#77:1:A>
How do you get the actual product into the hands of the person

<ICE-SIN:S2A-033#78:1:A>
Who's going to buy hopefully the product and therefore in terms of
what bridges you got to look at two views

<ICE-SIN:S2A-033#79:1:A>
The publishing first of all getting the book into print and out on
the table and the marketing and public relations and promotion uh you know
involve

<ICE-SIN:S2A-033#80:1:A>
Where publishing is concerned I think many of you would tend to
have uh uh come to a decision point whether you are going to raise or the
finance yourself

<ICE-SIN:S2A-033#81:1:A>
Uh and therefore have the money yourself to put behind getting the
books into print and publishing it which means you've got uh ultimately uh
control of uh the what goes into the book

<ICE-SIN:S2A-033#82:1:A>
You don't have to go through uhm such a tough editing process from
a publishing houses

<ICE-SIN:S2A-033#83:1:A>
You'll find I mean obviously you need editors to go through your
books to make sure that they are readable and in a readable state

<ICE-SIN:S2A-033#84:1:A>
But you could decide to finance yourself and go ahead and publish
the books

<ICE-SIN:S2A-033#85:1:A>
On the other hand like many other writers if you can't afford to do
that you got to then approach publishing houses

<ICE-SIN:S2A-033#86:1:A>
And in Singapore one of the nicest things is that there the
publishing trade is actually now quite open

<ICE-SIN:S2A-033#87:1:A>
And some of the people who I think have been on this programme are
actually supporting local authors

<ICE-SIN:S2A-033#88:1:A>
And I think the trade is uh really growing so you could submit your
scripts to the publishing houses and they will normally come back to you and
negotiate around what should be edited in what should be edited out what's is
sell sell sellable etcetera

<ICE-SIN:S2A-033#89:1:A>
So that's really the decision point you have to make in terms of
publishing

<ICE-SIN:S2A-033#90:1:A>
Where marketing is concern that's the entrepreneurship

<ICE-SIN:S2A-033#91:1:A>
Many authors tend to just say I've done my job I've written the
book it's now with the publishers it's in in just the basic form and that's
it you know

<ICE-SIN:S2A-033#92:1:A>
And uh leave the marketing and public relations very much to chance

<ICE-SIN:S2A-033#93:1:A>
Or sometimes if they have a good publisher the publisher would
normally organise you know the launch party the uhm press release etcetera

<ICE-SIN:S2A-033#94:1:A>
So this very much depends on how active one wants want one wants to
be

<ICE-SIN:S2A-033#95:1:A>
But one of the key things uh that you know that we are thinking and
and sharing with you is that you may have to think public relations

<ICE-SIN:S2A-033#96:1:A>
You may have to think promotions and you may have to get down into
the market to actually get your books going </I>
