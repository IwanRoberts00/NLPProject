<ICE-SIN:W1B-007#3:1>
Dearest Dylan,

<ICE-SIN:W1B-007#4:1>
Your mum just got your letter yesterday and excitedly called me and
Paul.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-007#5:1>
Oh boy!

<ICE-SIN:W1B-007#6:1>
Are we ( your mum, Paul & I) glad that what I named as " The Hunt for
Dylan" can be aborted.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-007#7:1>
What a relief!

<ICE-SIN:W1B-007#8:1>
I've actually called the Indian High Commission in S'pore ( says can't
help), the Govt.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-007#9:1>
of India Tourist Office here ( not fully functioning and no one
answered my call) and the S'pore High Com in Delhi ( called on Mon 26th
unrealistically hoping Deepavali would not be celebrated for so long there,
otherwise there's no prospect of my calling & your mum doesn't feel confident
in " weaving her way around/through" to get help).

<ICE-SIN:W1B-007#10:1>
Now both Paul & I've got to keep calling to inform those whom we've
contacted in the unlikely hope that you might have dropped a note somewhere.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-007#11:1>
Paul says he sure hopes you'll come back soon and in one piece....

<ICE-SIN:W1B-007#12:1>
so that he can kick you in the ass!

<ICE-SIN:W1B-007#13:1>
How could you let your mum worry like that?

<ICE-SIN:W1B-007#14:1>
Honestly if not for Paul's ominous dreams of you in trouble and my
paranoia aroused by that travelogue, we would have thought it absolutely
natural for you who have always been fickle to change your plans a little or
even a lot ( even over a cup of chai, I believe).

<ICE-SIN:W1B-007#15:1>
Anyway the 3 of us were bonded by 2 to 3 calls on average per day to
one another.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-007#16:1>
I was really getting jumpy and even quietly got myself prepared
psychologically to go over there to search for you!!

<ICE-SIN:W1B-007#17:1>
I guess I was really being overly imaginative & romantic.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-007#18:1>
Whatever the case, I'm really thankful you're alive and kicking even
though you're disgustingly incorrigible ( to have written but 1 " wise" line
about the mountains ( is that supposed to refer to yourself, wise guy?) after
knowing the big hoohah you've inadvertently created).

<ICE-SIN:W1B-007#19:1>
Even though it's no longer material, just to satisfy our curiosity.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-007#20:1>
( whether our speculations and part-findings were right).

<ICE-SIN:W1B-007#21:1>
1) What was the US&dollar;65 for ( one way flight from Srinagar to Ladakh?).

<ICE-SIN:W1B-007#22:1>
2) How did you get from Ladakh to Manali?

<ICE-SIN:W1B-007#23:1>
( I didn't know of a direct route)

<ICE-SIN:W1B-007#24:1>
3) Did you get the chance to experience the all notorious world's
second highest motor road that's so prone to avalanches?

<ICE-SIN:W1B-007#25:1>
Heard it takes 1 1/2 days by road from Srinagar to Ladakh?

<ICE-SIN:W1B-007#26:1>
4) How was Ladakh or in fact India so far?

<ICE-SIN:W1B-007#27:1>
5) Before going to Tamil Nadu to spend Christmas, where might you be
bound?

<ICE-SIN:W1B-007#28:1>
After Dharamsala, would there be another address to send you letters
to?

<ICE-SIN:W1B-007#29:1>
Looking in retrospect, the " hunt" sure added a lot of spice into
life but while at it, I'd rather there's nothing as dramatic & nerve-wrecking
like it at all.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-007#30:1>
It's like reading a thriller where you're totally absorbed & gripped
more & more & when it's over it leaves you with cold sweat but otherwise a
perfectly revived spirit.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-007#31:1>
Since coming back, I've often found myself in the " wrong" mood when
someone comes along & genuinely or not so genuinely says " Tell me about
India/ your experiences."

<ICE-SIN:W1B-007#32:1>
I know one main reason I dread the question is I don't wish to dwell
on it as if it's still not over.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-007#33:1>
But just 2 days ago, on a dreamy off-day ( Deepavali) I found myself
ravished with delightful/awesome thoughts & memories of India, the heat, the
strange people I met, the special totally " natural" sewage system ( with
cows eating banana skins & producing dung which is picked by little girls to
be slapped on mud walls, dried and used as fuel.) I was going on without end
to Meng Kong & a secondary school classmate.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-007#34:1>
That girl used to be so meek and fearsome of her " omnipotent" mum
but now having met an Arab girl when bringing her students to a tennis court,
decided to backpack in Pakistan, Punjab & Goa for a month.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-007#35:1>
I was so thrilled and was so encouraging that I thought I was
becoming you!

<ICE-SIN:W1B-007#36:1>
I'm so tempted myself...

<ICE-SIN:W1B-007#37:1>
must return before 30!

<ICE-SIN:W1B-007#38:1>
Yours,

<ICE-SIN:W1B-007#39:1>

Valentine's Day

<ICE-SIN:W1B-007#41:2>
Dearest Dylan,

<ICE-SIN:W1B-007#42:2>
It feels like ages since I last wrote to you.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-007#43:2>
Sorry I didn't write to your last destination, the ashram in Tamil
Nadu.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-007#44:2>
One day I was so thrilled at getting an aerogram from India, only to
be utterly disappointed it was actually my letter returned from Dharamsala.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-007#45:2>
Guess I'll enclose it anyway though judging from your last letter
it'll be totally irrelevant & meaningless, I don't recall what else I said
apart from the ominous feeling I had earlier over your disappearing act in
Ladakh and the immense relief when you reappeared.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-007#46:2>
Heard from your mum that you're now helping some doctor in Calcutta.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-007#47:2>
Just like you to be doing that but what's next, pal?

<ICE-SIN:W1B-007#48:2>
I've been pretty down though practice under an inspirational &
conscientious old gentleman proves to be quite uplifting.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-007#49:2>
I've won some Chambers hearings & lost some, & my first open court
was adjourned, so I'm still dying to do it.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-007#50:2>
Some guy from a pretty well-established litigation-powered firm I
know socially from the Sub courts bar room actually tried to get me over,
even though he hasn't seen me at trial & even though I warned him I'm only
half a year in practice - says I've got the trustworthy look - - hmm, quite
flattering I must say but I still prefer a more friendly, no politics
small-time firm.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-007#51:2>
Experience gained this way feels more, well, moral ( ? ) and guess
this will prove a much slower disillusioning process of law and justice.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-007#52:2>
Know what?

<ICE-SIN:W1B-007#53:2>
The profiteering ( more and more so under Yong Pung How) court
process really irks me.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-007#54:2>
Soon the courts will probably be called the Supreme Court of
Singapore Pte. Ltd.!!

<ICE-SIN:W1B-007#55:2>
Wonder if Jocelyn has told you of her new boyfriend?

<ICE-SIN:W1B-007#56:2>
I went out with her quite a few times - - their relationship seems
stable but just a big practical hurdle for them to overcome - - trying to
annul his marriage.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-007#57:2>
Well, in present practice it's a virtual impossibility.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-007#58:2>
Sticky as it might be, she's sensible enough to want to concentrate
on her finals & keep that on hold - - though God knows how effective that'll
be.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-007#59:2>
Just went windsurfing yesterday - - the masochistic joy of the bodily
aches just reminds me so vividly of our round-Maninjau biking trip.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-007#60:2>
I miss you still - - miss the spontaneous moments we share.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-007#61:2>
Though I thought I found a pal in Peter, he's just beyond grasp - -
we & Paul & Rajiv's brother Sanjay had another camp at Ubin on the second day
of CNY but boy - - it poured and there was a gushing river right under one of
the tents.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-007#62:2>
Thankfully it stopped & we still had a good stuffing dinner with so
much soup much was wasted the next morning after noodles breakfast.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-007#63:2>
After breakfast the whole campsite was submerged.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-007#64:2>
Have you found someone there - - that's the first reaction Pete had
when I told him you wouldn't write for awhile.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-007#65:2>
Sorry I couldn't find the negatives of your " Spot the Differences"
photo & not having shared your 6 albums with anyone yet - - but I gather it
must have been an enthralling experience in Africa.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-007#66:2>
With respect to Govind I gather it won't work out - - there's just
not enough common ground to begin with but being physically together showed
up the virtual impossibility of our ever being one, or as Kahlil Gibran puts
it - - being 2 pillars supporting the roof of a temple.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-007#67:2>
Now that I'm back to this life...

<ICE-SIN:W1B-007#68:2>
I wasn't sure but now having confided in a girlfriend, I'm becoming
more sure - - it probably won't affect the course of my life - - apart from
occasional blues and reminiscence - - as much as it would his.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-007#69:2>
I don't know how to break it to him - - I had thought it was sensible
for him to come over to the testing ground - - but as my friend rightly put
it - - it'll probably be much more devastating for him to find out here,
having no cushions to fall back on.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-007#70:2>
My, I'm so vexed!

<ICE-SIN:W1B-007#71:2>
He doesn't write for 2 months or 4(?) then sends a card to say he's
saving up for the trip & he's a third of the way through.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-007#72:2>
Doesn't say much about his life apart from this.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-007#73:2>
Gosh!

<ICE-SIN:W1B-007#74:2>
I'm jumpy & still don't know what to do.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-007#75:2>
I had set out a deadline since last December to reveal to him my
decision but it's already way beyond that - - really don't know if it's
passion holding me back or pure procrastination.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-007#76:2>
With respect to my other crisis - - it's not over & it's getting
worse but that I have to come to terms with - - it's probably going to be
perpetual - - I know no matter what, I can live with it.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-007#77:2>
Anyway I have to.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-007#78:2>
Guess I'll tell you - - if you're all ears - - when you're back.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-007#79:2>
Socially I've been really active - - took up tennis beginners'
course.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-007#80:2>
That's ended but our group of 7 is still quite cohesive.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-007#81:2>
We went out for a real good movie " Accidental Hero" starring Dustin
Hoffman, Geena Davis & Andy Garcia & had another session which turned out to
be much longer than planned - - guess there'll be more sessions to come.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-007#82:2>
I've been quite a spender - - on clothes & books - - I'm now at
Robert Pirsig's second book, " Lila: An Inquiry into Morals".

<ICE-SIN:W1B-007#83:2>
Though not as gripping as " Zen", it still spins a good web - -
really unusual.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-007#84:2>
There's also this Indian men period - - dunno if I've bragged about
it already - - when 4 or so were unusually interested in me.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-007#85:2>
No doubt they're fun to talk to - - being such naturals at the art of
the tongue but always feel they're dangerous to meddle with.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-007#86:2>
And this most recent guy with whom there's mutual interest - - but it
turns out he only talks passionately about work & is married - - am I glad I
got a girlfriend along to our drinking session.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-007#87:2>
Then there's the over-cautious guy who at one time called me everyday
& some days more than once who would come up with surprise invitations or a
drink but sends a Valentine card signing off " Just friends".

<ICE-SIN:W1B-007#88:2>
Wonder what there is to qualify?

<ICE-SIN:W1B-007#89:2>
Guess I'll take up dancing, probably jazz, again.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-007#90:2>
Gonna get the adrenaline pumping.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-007#91:2>
Just hope it won't be long before I know where to send this letter
to.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-007#92:2>
HAPPY VALENTINE'S!

<ICE-SIN:W1B-007#93:2>
( Backdate it OK?)

<ICE-SIN:W1B-007#94:2>
Love & Hugs,

<ICE-SIN:W1B-007#95:2>

Mon

<ICE-SIN:W1B-007#97:3>
8/3/93

<ICE-SIN:W1B-007#98:3>
2.30 am

<ICE-SIN:W1B-007#99:3>
Dear Dylan

<ICE-SIN:W1B-007#100:3>
Well, after receiving your letter on 19th Feb 93 after a wild nite
out, I have been thinking hard where to send my letter to you & also trying
hard to get Peter but he's always having his nap or out or not back yet or at
camp.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-007#101:3>
Can you fathom a more unreachable friend?

<ICE-SIN:W1B-007#102:3>
Lian Huay has been missing from my life for a long, long time too.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-007#103:3>
In fact I'm feeling really depressed lately - - I've been
overspending shortly before & after I wrote a letter to Govind on Valentine's
Day after writing yours, & making myself more blue by trying to alleviate my
moodiness hanging around " fun" people & places but just ended up feeling
meaningless!

<ICE-SIN:W1B-007#104:3>
Recently - - just 2 nights ago at a Teo clan dinner - - I got to
know this chief editor of a Chinese paper whom I've always admired & realised
that the decision to end the relationship with Govind is the right choice.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-007#105:3>
Not that I've fallen for that man ( I'm not interested in married
men), but I've realised it'll need to be someone of that kind of intellect,
wide-ranging interests & thought.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-007#106:3>
I just can't help noticing the stark lack of depth in what I can
share with Govind - - no doubt he's kind but like you and Lian Huay knew from
the outset - - we just lack that common ground for it to work out. <X>

<ICE-SIN:W1B-007#X107:3>
Maybe it was only me that couldn't see them.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-007#X108:3>
I don't think it's good enough if I can share much more with you,
Lian Huay etc. than with him.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-007#X109:3>
Well, that aside, just to clarify some matters, I certainly never
knew about the Modern Lodge address - - could that letter be held up in the 1
month strike you mentioned to your mum as well?

<ICE-SIN:W1B-007#X110:3>
Well if you do receive this letter & if everything else - - time,
money, mood - - permits, do give me a ring OK?

<ICE-SIN:W1B-007#X111:3>
Haven't heard your voice for such a long time.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-007#X112:3>
How's your visit to Benares?

<ICE-SIN:W1B-007#X113:3>
I certainly enjoyed that very-rich-with-culture-&-myth place
tremendously & that inspirational singing by a devout Hindu taking his daily
bath in the Ganges at dawn & too many other things.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-007#X114:3>
Did you stay at your old lodge - - Trimurti - - again?

<ICE-SIN:W1B-007#X115:3>
Well, about your name Aniccananda - - I just wonder how
Impermanence can be bliss?

<ICE-SIN:W1B-007#X116:3>
I've just been lamenting to Peter in a letter ( as I've given up
looking for him & decided to send your letter to him) that I seem to have
lost passion for life & that joys & pain are so transient but meaningless
prevails.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-007#X117:3>
Perhaps in your present state you could enlighten me?

<ICE-SIN:W1B-007#X118:3>
Why do I not feel the lingering joy & satissfaction that I used to
after cycling, windsurfing or even after some hard work but only while at it?

<ICE-SIN:W1B-007#X119:3>
I'm getting purely existential now & I hate it!

<ICE-SIN:W1B-007#X120:3>
Guru pray tell me how to be revitalised?

<ICE-SIN:W1B-007#X121:3>
If it's all in the mind then how to even begin?

<ICE-SIN:W1B-007#X122:3>
My tennis class is over & I've just begun on French again - - even
then I'm not really any happier.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-007#X123:3>
Well but whatever it is, I have faith I'll come round.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-007#X124:3>
Anyway I'm now at Richard Bach's " Bridge Across Forever".

<ICE-SIN:W1B-007#X125:3>
It sure gives great consolation.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-007#X126:3>
