<ICE-SIN:W2F-002#1:1>
<h> GENTLY APART </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2F-002#2:1>
IN THE sultry silence of the hot June afternoon, Ah Hua knelt before
the ornately decorated altar and bowed in solemn reverence, nine glowing
joss-sticks held between her palms.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-002#3:1>
A fish offering of oranges and peaches sat beside the image of
Guanyin, the Chinese Goddess of Mercy.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-002#4:1>
Ah Hua straightened and planted three of the joss-sticks into a
porcelain urn which already held the remaining red wooden leads of previous
offerings.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-002#5:1>
With a grunt, she stood up and, bowing piously to the deity, she
retreated and moved to the front door where she placed three of the six
sticks into a small joss-stick holder at the upper edge of the door for the
Lord of the Sky and the rest at the lower edge for the Grandfather Soil.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-002#6:1>
Ah Hua had great dreams.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-002#7:1>
She had always been the 'slightly crazy one' in the family, dreaming
of all the wonderful things which no one in the entire village even dared
imagine.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-002#8:1>
She had been eager to achieve, to learn and to prove herself, if not
anybody else.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-002#9:1>
She wanted to be somebody, someone who had accomplishments to be proud
of, someone who could look back on her life and see that some meaning had
been woven into what would otherwise have been a long boring routine.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-002#10:1>
Twenty-seven years in the conservative world of the Chinese
communists did little to curb her youthful enthusiasm.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-002#11:1>
She had arrived, a naive young woman with childish long plaits and
adorned in a drab blue suit so characteristic of the Maoist reign but her
heart had been filled with hopeful eagerness.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-002#12:1>
The next twenty-seven years had gradually killed her dreams,
strangling them with an eternal cord of hungry, boisterous children, an ever
increasing load of dirty clothing, the deary soaping and sudding of oily
plates and bowls, and those hot tiring hours sweating before the blackened
charcoal stove, cooking for the workers in her husband's tinsmith shop.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-002#13:1>
As a child, she had been filled with fickle-minded ambitions.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-002#14:1>
A singer, a teacher, an opera-performer, an artist, a writer, a
calligrapher - these had all been a part of her many ideals at one time or
another.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-002#15:1>
Now, all she was and would ever be was a grumpy, disillusioned,
boring housewife without a mind of her own, always slaving only to do some
tasks set for her by others.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-002#16:1>
She hated it.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-002#17:1>
How she envied those women who had a career, some sort of direction,
goals to wake up to every morning.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-002#18:1>
What did she have?

<ICE-SIN:W2F-002#19:1>
A small untidy shop-house ridden with hideous cockroaches and rats,
grown children who never bothered to visit, and a husband who followed the
most boring schedule in the world.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-002#20:1>
She wanted some achievement which she could call her own.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-002#21:1>
She wondered if she was doomed to fighting fate and losing - every
time!

<ICE-SIN:W2F-002#22:1>
Her husband had worked as a tinsmith even before they were married;
he had been apprenticed to the village tinsmith back in their village in
Guangdong when he was only eight; that was his only expertise, but at least
he had an expertise, something he knew and could be proud of, a craft that he
was thoroughly familiar with.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-002#23:1>
After all those years, he still had a passionate, defensive loyalty
towards his trade.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-002#24:1>
All those years, through the Depression, the entire Japanese
Occupation, the riots and unrest of the fifties, he had got up at six,
followed the same routine of food, work and hour of puffing at his enormous
pipe before retiring to bed.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-002#25:1>
She remembered time when he, too, had seemed to have the same
beautiful ideals as she had.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-002#26:1>
Yes, there had been a time when he had even bought a calculator to
keep a tab on his bills and receipts instead of using abacus.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-002#27:1>
There was a time when he had supported her fight against sexual
discrimination; there was a time when he had agreed with her that Western
capitalism did not only mean greed but also progress, a desire to improve
living standards.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-002#28:1>
Those times had vanished.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-002#29:1>
Those times were so dim that it seemed as though they never existed.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-002#30:1>
Slowly, he had settled down to a dull existence, making an honest
living from honest hours of hard work.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-002#31:1>
He stopped talking about moving up in society, or getting a better,
more hygienic apartment at one of those impressive new housing estates built
by the government.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-002#32:1>
Their shop-house, forlorn and weary, stood squeezed among other
equally pathetic looking structures, all crying for a coat of paint.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-002#33:1>
The floor of wooden planks rattled and complained at the slightest
provocation, and the tap, rusty and corroded, screeched like a gleeful wicked
witch when turned on.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-002#34:1>
He had been a little irritated when she tried to persuade him to get
the tap fixed.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-002#35:1>
" We should be grateful we have a tap," he said.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-002#36:1>
" In China, don't you remember, we don't get fresh water this easily?

<ICE-SIN:W2F-002#37:1>
Don't you remember how we had to carry every drop from the well?

<ICE-SIN:W2F-002#38:1>
Now we have a tap, so we really should not complain." He had a
neutral way of speaking which was perhaps one reason why they never had a
quarrel although she felt sometimes that he could be most exasperating.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-002#39:1>
He was never forceful in his speech and hence, never offensive.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-002#40:1>
This is not China, she had wanted to scream in frustration but of
course, she did not.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-002#41:1>
For all his passiveness and lack of the aggressive drive which
irritated her, he was still her husband and she did not believe in
henpecking.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-002#42:1>
China was a land they had left behind forever when they had stepped
onto the unsteady overloaded junk in search of a better life.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-002#43:1>
China should be just a hazy memory of simple peasants who worked only
to fill their stomachs and stored enough food to last through winter.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-002#44:1>
Here was the new life they had sought, but still, he held on tightly
to the surreal images of his old backward motherland; he was simply too
afraid to let those familiar feelings of home die.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-002#45:1>
Now, everyone had fashionable taps.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-002#46:1>
Everyone was obsessively conscious of cleanliness and hygiene, and
yet, he would calmly point out that they fortunate because they had a toilet
that flushed instead of having a night-soil collector visit them daily.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-002#47:1>
He was a good provider, she admitted, but his perspectives were all
wrong.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-002#48:1>
He just could not accept the fact that they were not in the old land,
that their world should now belong to that of this ambitious island on which
they had indeed advanced a long way, indulging in luxuries which would never
have been possible in their homeland.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-002#49:1>
In his eyes, they were not hanging on to the lowest rung of the
ladder, the large group of illiterate, ignorant immigrants who slaved as
labourers in this land of promise and opportunity.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-002#50:1>
It was like telling themselves a little lie to justify inertia where
enthusiasm and ambition should have been; it was like imagining that they had
improved tremendously when in truth, they had only taken a tiny steps already
achieved by others.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-002#51:1>
She wanted a fight.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-002#52:1>
She wanted to scream out the frustration festering inside.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-002#53:1>
Perhaps yelling and screeching like a lunatic would help release the
bitterness and disappointment choking her life.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-002#54:1>
Those wasted hours, those precious seconds, caught in a web of
drudgery when she could have done something, accomplished something
meaningful.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-002#55:1>
They never had a fight before.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-002#56:1>
Perhaps it was time to start one.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-002#57:1>
She felt she could remain dormant no longer.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-002#58:1>
She bowed deeply from habit even as these angry thoughts ran through
he mind.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-002#59:1>
Her husband had never been unfaithful and she wondered if she was
quite out of her mind, for now she actually wanted him to be.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-002#60:1>
That, she thought, should add some excitement, some unpredictability
into their lives.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-002#61:1>
She glanced up at the huge dark clock on the wall.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-002#62:1>
It was one minute to four.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-002#63:1>
She removed two char siew buns, which were hot and deliciously soft,
from the steamer and placed them on a chipped yellowed plate.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-002#64:1>
Then regular as clockwork, her husband appeared at the door, wiping
beads of perspiration from his heads, a rolled up Chinese newspaper tucked
under his right arm.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-002#65:1>
He was a stocky man, balding slightly at the temple; he had enormous
staring eyes below his bushy eyebrows and showed carelessly arranged
tobacco-stained teeth when he smiled; his pot belly, the result of years of
pork lard and beer, heaved as he walked.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-002#66:1>
He sat down, unfolded the newspaper and spread it on the table,
partly touching the fresh buns.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-002#67:1>
Then he flapped one corner, took a bun which now bore several black
smears from the newspaper print, and ate contentedly.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-002#68:1>
" Look at that," she sighed loudly.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-002#69:1>
" Just look at that!

<ICE-SIN:W2F-002#70:1>
You have made the buns all dirty.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-002#71:1>
Don't you know the ink is poisonous?

<ICE-SIN:W2F-002#72:1>
Can't you be more careful?

<ICE-SIN:W2F-002#73:1>
One of these days, you are going to die of poisoning, and then you
will be sorry, but it will be too late.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-002#74:1>
Yes, too late." She closed the lid of the pot with a loud clanging.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-002#75:1>
He looked up in surprise.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-002#76:1>
" Huh?" " How is it that you never listen to me when I speak?

<ICE-SIN:W2F-002#77:1>
You never hear a word I say.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-002#78:1>
My words just blow pass your ears like the wind.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-002#79:1>
Yes, like the wind." She threw the ladle into the sink.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-002#80:1>
A fight was starting up very nicely.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-002#81:1>
Unperturbed, he sent his teeth into the freshly steamed dough and the
tasty meat filling, his eyes on her, puzzled and a little surprised.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-002#82:1>
" This tastes very good." " Can't you speak?

<ICE-SIN:W2F-002#83:1>
All you do when you come home is eat and sleep.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-002#84:1>
Yes, eat and sleep.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-002#85:1>
That is all you know how to do.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-002#86:1>
Why don't we talk any more?

<ICE-SIN:W2F-002#87:1>
Why am I the only one dreaming our big dreams now?" She gritted her
teeth as she watched him slowly fold the newspaper back into a neat tube.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-002#88:1>
" What are you talking about?

<ICE-SIN:W2F-002#89:1>
What have char siew buns got to do with dreams?

<ICE-SIN:W2F-002#90:1>
What are you talking about?" He rubbed his nose from which flared
several long strands of hair.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-002#91:1>
" One moment you are telling me to stop eating ink and then you
suddenly bring up dreams.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-002#92:1>
What is the matter?" His voice was patient, as always.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-002#93:1>
" Our big dreams!

<ICE-SIN:W2F-002#94:1>
Our big dreams!

<ICE-SIN:W2F-002#95:1>
You used to have them too, remember?

<ICE-SIN:W2F-002#96:1>
We used to work for them together.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-002#97:1>
Why am I alone now?

<ICE-SIN:W2F-002#98:1>
When we were in China, you had great ambitions.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-002#99:1>
You wanted to make a lots of money, you wanted to - " She stopped,
exhausted and feeling that her efforts at sparking off a fire were futile.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-002#100:1>
" Aren't you happy?" His face was calm and placid.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-002#101:1>
" Damn it, I am not talking about happiness.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-002#102:1>
I'm talking about the dreams that you have given up chasing," she
seethed.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-002#103:1>
" Why are you always so angry, so frustrated?" He took another bite
and chewed rapidly.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-002#104:1>
" What is it that will make you happy?

<ICE-SIN:W2F-002#105:1>
Will just dreaming and chasing dreams make you happy?

<ICE-SIN:W2F-002#106:1>
Haven't we got all the clothes and food we need?" " Dreaming will
not make me happy," she cried.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-002#107:1>
" It is dying dreams that is making me so mad and unhappy.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-002#108:1>
I am not discontented with what we have - if this is the best we can
manage.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-002#109:1>
We could do better.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-002#110:1>
A million times better." Yes, she was angry.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-002#111:1>
Yes she was frustrated.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-002#112:1>
Her hopes, he ambitions, were now gradually drifting away.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-002#113:1>
She was angry because she was fifty-four and still as far from her
goal as she had been years ago.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-002#114:1>
She was only a housewife.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-002#115:1>
She hated being cooped up like the hens on the farm back home.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-002#116:1>
Where was the freedom that migration to this free land promised?

<ICE-SIN:W2F-002#117:1>
She felt deflated and suddenly, she wanted to cry.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-002#118:1>
Tears filled her eyes and overflowed into streamlets down her
cheeks.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-002#119:1>
A whole life wasted.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-002#120:1>
Her whole life wasted.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-002#121:1>
Then she felt his hands on the shoulder. <X>

<ICE-SIN:W2F-002#X122:1>
They seldom touched.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-002#X123:1>
For a long time, the comfort of touching had been forgotten.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-002#X124:1>
She gave a involuntary shudder and leaned against him, feeling
secure as his calloused hands tightened her. </X> </I>
