<h> Specifying your requirements </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2D-014#4:1>
Before you can start building your computer system, you need to
specify your requirements.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-014#5:1>
In computer jargon, these requirements are called functional
specifications.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-014#6:1>
These are the " blue-prints" that are prepared to show exactly how the
computer system is intended to function, and it is paramount that this first
step is done properly.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-014#7:1>
Before we go into the first step, a few preliminary comments are in
order.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-014#8:1>
<h> Computerising Versus Automating a Manual System </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2D-014#9:1>
Computers and humans are different.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-014#10:1>
You cannot just look at what your manual system is presently doing,
and automate that.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-014#11:1>
Your manual system may be good for your existing needs because it is
designed to take into account the strengths and weaknesses of people.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-014#12:1>
It may feature error prevention procedures ( eg double entry
accounting) and contain opportunities for " fixes" and " creativity" ( eg
special discounts for selected clients) and so on.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-014#13:1>
A computer system must be designed to take into account the strengths
and weaknesses of computers, and these are entirely different from those of
human beings.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-014#14:1>
For example, computers never get tired, and never make mistakes on
repetitive tasks ( unless the program is wrong).

<ICE-SIN:W2D-014#15:1>
However, computers cannot make judgements and may not be as flexible
as humans are.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-014#16:1>
These differences demand new ways of looking at your operations so
that the computer system you are going to put in place will be appropriate
and effective. <h> Can I Do It On My Own? </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2D-014#17:1>
Do not be tempted to purchase computers prematurely.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-014#18:1>
Conduct a thorough information systems requirement analysis with the
assistance of an experienced analyst.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-014#19:1>
If you have no in-house computerisation expertise, and you do not
wish to re-invent the wheel, it may be wise to engage the help of an IT
consultant.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-014#20:1>
But you have to be sure that this outside IT consultant has the
specialised skills, knowledge and experience that is appropriate for YOUR
environment, as ultimately, the responsibility for the project is still
yours.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-014#21:1>
The IT consultant should have a clear idea of the computerisation
process and be able to guide you through the procedural steps discussed in
Chapter 3.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-014#22:1>
For a detailed discussion on the services of IT consultants, please
refer to Chapter 4 on " The IT consultant".

<ICE-SIN:W2D-014#23:1>
There are various technical and financial schemes available to
eligible local enterprises for computerisation.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-014#24:1>
Details of these are available in chapter 9 " Government Incentive
Schemes."

<ICE-SIN:W2D-014#25:1>
<h> Are the Right People Involved? </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2D-014#26:1>
For your computerisation project to be successful, you must ensure
end-user involvement.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-014#27:1>
End-users are the people who would ultimately use the system.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-014#28:1>
The end users are probably the best people who can help identify
problems early through ongoing review.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-014#29:1>
And most of these problems, when identified, can be readily
addressed.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-014#30:1>
It is rare for IT consultants to know your business and " business
experience", Furthermore, IT consultants and business people conceptualise
the world in different ways.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-014#31:1>
A good working relationship between the consultant and the end-user
should be established.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-014#32:1>
Therefore, ensure that at least one end-user is involved in the
meetings with the consultant.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-014#33:1>
<h> Who Should Take Charge? </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2D-014#34:1>
Whether you decide on using in-house expertise or an external IT
consultant, someone or some committee has to be set up to oversee the
computerisation project.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-014#35:1>
Computerisation is a cooperative effort between the users and the
consultant, and this effort needs to be guided to ensure a smooth
implementation.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-014#36:1>
To emphasise the importance of the effort being made by the company
to computerise, active involvement and commitment of top management is often
necessary.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-014#37:1>
It is usually recommended that the Chief Executive Officer ( CEO) of
the company chairs a committee comprising the heads of departments affected
by computerisation.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-014#38:1>
The committee should meet regularly to keep track of the progress of
the project, make the necessary important decisions along the way, and review
the post-implementation process.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-014#39:1>
Having said all these, we can now get down to the details of
specifying your requirements.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-014#40:1>
<h> What Are Your Computerisation Needs? </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2D-014#41:1>
This is the first step of the feasibility study.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-014#42:1>
It aims to determine the computerisation needs of your company by
identifying and documenting the areas to computerise and to prioritise them
based on your business strategies.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-014#43:1>
<h> Things to do </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2D-014#44:1>
What you need to do during this first step is to: Review your
organisation's goals and priorities.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-014#45:1>
By refreshing yourself on this, you will be better able to focus on
how computerisation can help you attain these goals.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-014#46:1>
Determine how computerisation can benefit your company strategically.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-014#47:1>
Here, you may be able to work on getting strategic advantage out of
computerisation rather than just looking at how to get a job done faster.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-014#48:1>
Determine which application systems offer the greatest potential
benefits to the company.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-014#49:1>
This will help you to prioritise the areas you want to computerise,
taking into consideration your strategic plans and costs.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-014#50:1>
Assess your company's existing environment and structure.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-014#51:1>
Are you ready to computerise?

<ICE-SIN:W2D-014#52:1>
Have you establish your fundamentals?

<ICE-SIN:W2D-014#53:1>
If not, get everything in order.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-014#54:1>
<h> What is achieved </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2D-014#55:1>
By the end of this step, you should be able to draw up a list of
business functions that can be computerised, as well as give some indication
of the order of priority for computerisation.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-014#56:1>
<h> What Exactly Do You Want The Computer System to do for You? </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2D-014#57:1>
The next step involves defining the detailed requirements involves
both the users and the IT consultants.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-014#58:1>
This process helps the company and IT consultant analyse existing
functions and procedures in all areas of the company, and facilitates
breaking down of these functions and procedures into smaller and more
manageable elements.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-014#59:1>
By doing so, you are able to specify what you want out of
computerisation for the different business functions you have identified.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-014#60:1>
<h> Things to do </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2D-014#61:1>
During this step, you need to:

<ICE-SIN:W2D-014#62:1>
1) Review and analyse your current operations.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-014#63:1>
This examines the detail functioning of the different areas of your
operations.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-014#64:1>
By looking at how things are presently done, you may decide to
maintain, develop new, enhance or even eliminate the work methods and
procedures so that full advantage can be taken of the strengths of computers.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-014#65:1>
2) Gather samples of input documents for the different functions and
review the information captured in these documents to determine whether there
is a need for it or whether any additional information is required.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-014#66:1>
Here you must also determine the frequency of use of each of the
documents.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-014#67:1>
3) Gather samples of all reports ( or output documents) for the
different functions.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-014#68:1>
Again, you must take note of the content and frequency of each
report.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-014#69:1>
4) Define and document the systems requirements.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-014#70:1>
This is the point where extra care should be taken to differentiate
between what you must have, what would be useful to have, and what would be
nice to have in the proposed System.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-014#71:1>
This will help you to develop a system that is appropriate and
relevant to your needs, given the constraints of budget, hardware and
software.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-014#72:1>
This is also the time for you to determine how the area under
analysis should be integrated to other application areas, how much
information to keep, for how long, and how sensitive it is.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-014#73:1>
<h> What is achieved </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2D-014#74:1>
At the end of the process, the IT consultant and the company should
be able to come up with a document that describes the functions and
requirements of the areas under study.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-014#75:1>
Extracts of such a document can be found in Annex

<ICE-SIN:W2D-014#76:1>
11.This document, generally known as a functional specifications
report will be submitted to the committee for approval.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-014#77:1>
It is a very important document which once approved, will be used as
part of the request-for-Proposal document when shopping for vendors.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-014#78:1>
Such a report will provide the committee with an idea of the scale of
the project and a recommendation on whether customised software or
off-the-shelf software is required for the project.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-014#79:1>
And this in turn will, to a large extent, determine the type of
computers to purchase.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-014#80:1>
<h> Selecting Hardware and software </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2D-014#81:1>
In defining your requirements, you will already have determined your
approach to computerisation to a large extent.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-014#82:1>
The functional specifications document should have given you an idea
of the scope and magnitude of the project.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-014#83:1>
Based on that, and your analysis of your own resources and direction,
you will be able to choose the kind of solution you want.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-014#84:1>
The main considerations at this stage are the kind of software
required to process your business needs, and the hardware required to drive
the software.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-014#85:1>
<h> Software </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2D-014#86:1>
Software requirements are determined by the areas of your business
that you wish to have computerised.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-014#87:1>
What are the applications which are required?

<ICE-SIN:W2D-014#88:1>
Is it in the area of Accounting?

<ICE-SIN:W2D-014#89:1>
Project management?

<ICE-SIN:W2D-014#90:1>
Production control?

<ICE-SIN:W2D-014#91:1>
Or is it the provision of up-to-date management information?

<ICE-SIN:W2D-014#92:1>
Your requirements would have been specified by now, and you should be
looking at whether the software you require can be bought off-the-shelf, or
if you need to customise such software for your needs, or if you need someone
to develop the software from scratch.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-014#93:1>
<h> Hardware </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2D-014#94:1>
You should start looking at hardware requirements only after you have
decided on the kind of software required.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-014#95:1>
There is simply no point in buying the cheapest computer available if
your software is going to run like a tortoise on it.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-014#96:1>
This is the point where you have to identify the kind of computer you
need ( mainframe, mini or micro), how many you need, and whether you should
network them ( ie connect them up in such a way that they can " talk" to each
other and share peripherals such as inters, modems, etc.) You should also be
looking at issues such as electronic storage space ( ie the size of hard
disks required), displays required ( large screen or small screen monitors,
colour or monochrome, VGA or CGA, etc) and memory etc.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-014#97:1>
Some of the terms used here are further explained in the Annex III,
Common Computer Terms.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-014#98:1>
<h> Approaches to Computerisation </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2D-014#99:1>
So how are you going to approach this question of selecting your
computers and software?

<ICE-SIN:W2D-014#100:1>
Generally you have the following alternatives in determining your
approach to computerisation: Aiming for a turnkey system for the whole
project.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-014#101:1>
This means you appoint a vendor or software house who will work very
closely with you in providing a solution for your needs.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-014#102:1>
This vendor may not be the supplier of all the equipment and
software that you need, but he will do the running around and put the package
together, and be answerable for the whole solution so that you do not have to
deal with countless vendors.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-014#103:1>
This can be a good solution, except you have to be careful of
tendency to be overly dependent on the vendor.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-014#104:1>
It also restricts you somewhat to the kinds of hardware and software
you can opt for.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-014#105:1>
2) Developing a solution using pre-packaged applications This
approach aims at using existing software packages to meet your needs.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-014#106:1>
It is an economical way to computerise.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-014#107:1>
You would also have the flexibility of selecting hardware and
software from a variety of vendors.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-014#108:1>
However, it may leave peculiar aspects of your business uncatered
for, hence some degree of software customisation is often necessary when
adopting this approach.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-014#109:1>
In addition, you must also ensure that all the software modules
selected are integrated to meet the business needs.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-014#110:1>
3) Opting for in-house development of a solution This option can be
taken if you have the resources to employ your own in-house systems people.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-014#111:1>
It could be the most satisfactory solution if you have highly
specialised needs that need constant tuning, customisation and attention.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-014#112:1>
It is also probably the most expensive.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-014#113:1>
4) Using external systems services.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-014#114:1>
You may also choose to use what is commonly called a " bureau
service" for your business needs.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-014#115:1>
This means that you use the systems and software set up by an
external company whose business is to cater for the computer needs of
organisations like yours.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-014#116:1>
For example, you may be the publisher of a bi-monthly magazine.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-014#117:1>
All you need is to use the computer to do the layout of your
magazine once every two months, and for three to four days only. <X>

<ICE-SIN:W2D-014#X118:1>
You feel that you do not need to use computers in any other way.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-014#X119:1>
You may consider buying time from a bureau service to do this.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-014#X120:1>
Each of these approaches has its inherent strengths and weaknesses.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-014#X121:1>
But whatever the case, you will have to make a decision based on
your organisation's needs and a clear understanding of the strengths and
weaknesses of the different approaches.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-014#X122:1>
Once you have decided your approach, you can proceed with the
nitty-gritty on this stage of the computerisation process. </X> </I>
