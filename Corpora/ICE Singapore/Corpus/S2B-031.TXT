At the crack of each dawn these Thai novice monks will follow
an ancient Buddhist custom to seek that daily arms in the streets of Bangkok

<ICE-SIN:S2B-031#2:1:A>
And just as early each day another group of Thais will be responding
to an equally ancient but different practice Chinese callisthenics

<ICE-SIN:S2B-031#3:1:A>
These are ethnic Chinese who are either from or trace their roots to
the Chow Sun district in China's Kwantong province

<ICE-SIN:S2B-031#4:1:A>
They are Teochews the dialect group that most ethnic Chinese in
Thailand belong to

<ICE-SIN:S2B-031#5:1:A>
And here at the spawling compound of the Teochew Association where
the steps of Taichi are still being practiced day after day

<ICE-SIN:S2B-031#6:1:A>
It appears that even in Thailand some ancient Chinese ways have
resisted the forces of assimilation and acculturation

<ICE-SIN:S2B-031#7:1:A>
This temple was set up in memory of one of the early Chinese
pioneers Wu Chow Sun

<ICE-SIN:S2B-031#8:1:A>
Besides being the traditional rallying point of the Teochews in
Bangkok the temple provides both young and old the spiritual relief of the
Mahayanar school of Buddhism a more eclectic Chinese version of the Federa
<unclear> word </unclear> school which the Thai have adopted

<ICE-SIN:S2B-031#9:1:A>
Despite the variation the commonality found in Buddhism was and
still is a powerful factor in the grafting together of the Thai and Chinese
communities

<ICE-SIN:S2B-031#10:1:A>
Only some eight per cent of the population have retained a pure
Chinese bloodline and it's estimated that over forty per cent are of mixed
parentage

<ICE-SIN:S2B-031#11:1:A>
But the passing of the older generation has distanced ancestral
ways

<ICE-SIN:S2B-031#12:1:A>
The practice of burial for instance has given way to the Thai
custom of cremation

<ICE-SIN:S2B-031#13:1:A>
It's just one indication of how rapidly most Chinese have
assimilated

<ICE-SIN:S2B-031#14:1:A>
For the fuel towards assimilation is inexorable in Thailand and
it's especially rapid amongst the middle-class Chinese

<ICE-SIN:S2B-031#15:1:A>
Chen Song Te came to Thailand when he was fourteen

<ICE-SIN:S2B-031#16:1:A>
Although married to a Chinese nearly all his grand children are of
mixed parentage Chen tries often to speak to them in Teochew but the boys can
only reply in Thai

<ICE-SIN:S2B-031#17:1:A>
Nearly all the goldsmith shops in Bangkok are owned by ethnic
Chinese and for that matter so are most other businesses

<ICE-SIN:S2B-031#18:1:A>
But it is accepted because there was a grafting of the two peoples
and cultures into a collective Thai identity

<ICE-SIN:S2B-031#19:1:A>
The same however cannot be said of the Chinese elsewhere

<ICE-SIN:S2B-031#20:1:A>
In Indonesia ethnic Chinese makeup only one per cent of the
population but are believed to control seventy per cent of the economy and
that fact often sits uncomfortably with the widespread poverty

<ICE-SIN:S2B-031#21:1:A>
It's just one reason why the Chinese here have worked hard to down
play and hide their Chineseness

<ICE-SIN:S2B-031#22:1:A>
But ethnicity has always been a sensitive issue in South-East Asia

<ICE-SIN:S2B-031#23:1:A>
A country like Malaysia has been torn apart more than once by
primordial pulls of race and religion

<ICE-SIN:S2B-031#24:1:A>
And often the unspoken problem lay with the perceived unwillingness
of the ethnic Chinese to assimilate

<ICE-SIN:S2B-031#25:1:A>
Exalting mankind to share and respect the world

<ICE-SIN:S2B-031#26:1:A>
This couplet reflects well the hopes of those who now call
Australia home

<ICE-SIN:S2B-031#27:1:A>
For here one can find thousands who had come from Indo-China and
South-East Asia

<ICE-SIN:S2B-031#28:1:A>
Many are ethnic Chinese whose families had lived in Asia for
generations but who have found it necessary to leave their first adopted
homes

<ICE-SIN:S2B-031#29:1:A>
Not only is remigration changing physical landscapes it is also
altering the pattern of assimilation and acculturation with racial and
cultural diversity as a reality Western countries now have to come to terms
with the Asianisation of their societies

<ICE-SIN:S2B-031#30:1:A>
This has been given added momentum in recent years by another huge
outpouring of ethnic Chinese who strangely enough are from a place where they
are the majority

<ICE-SIN:S2B-031#31:1:A>
This used to be the entry point into Hong Kong for thousands of
Chinese immigrants

<ICE-SIN:S2B-031#32:1:A>
Even today near this former railway station Hakka women from China
could be seen in their traditional costumes clinging stubbornly to the ways
of the forebears

<ICE-SIN:S2B-031#33:1:A>
Vestiges of Chinese culture denounced and discarded by the
Communist mainland still have a place under Hong Kong skies

<ICE-SIN:S2B-031#34:1:A>
The traditional Chinese reverance for bloodline family continuity
and ancestral blessings still hold sway

<ICE-SIN:S2B-031#35:1:A>
And the Hong Kong people like other overseas Chinese have followed
the collective impulse to pre-empt the vagaries of fate invoking the gods of
their fathers and asking as their ancestors did for health children and
especially success in life

<ICE-SIN:S2B-031#36:1:A>
The form today may have modern permutations but the substance
remains

<ICE-SIN:S2B-031#37:1:A>
In this island of Chinese capitalism the search for economic
security has permeated all levels of society

<ICE-SIN:S2B-031#38:1:A>
And so the impending return to China in nineteen ninety-seven has
stacked the odds real or psychological against getting that security

<ICE-SIN:S2B-031#39:1:A>
And thus the exodus from or some would even say the haemorrhaging
of Hong Kong Canada has been receiving a massive infusion of the new Hong
Kong blood

<ICE-SIN:S2B-031#40:1:A>
Already some twenty-five per cent or more of Vancouver's population
is Chinese and the figure is rising each day

<ICE-SIN:S2B-031#41:1:A>
Aberdeen Centre in the Vancouver's suburbs is a direct result of
the invasion of people from Hong Kong with full wallets

<ICE-SIN:S2B-031#42:1:A>
Named after the Aberdeen district in Hong Kong it is for all
practical purposes a shopping mall transplanted from the British colony

<ICE-SIN:S2B-031#43:1:A>
The immigration counter here is a simple reminder of the growing
influx of ethnic Chinese from Hong Kong and Asia

<ICE-SIN:S2B-031#44:1:A>
The property market is buzzing along spurred by land-hungry Hong
Kong immigrants

<ICE-SIN:S2B-031#45:1:A>
This however has created some awkwardness

<ICE-SIN:S2B-031#46:1:A>
Douglas Chang is a second-generation Canadian Chinese and the first
ethnic Chinese to be elected as a member of parliament

<ICE-SIN:S2B-031#47:1:A>
The Chang family trace their Canadian roots back to a Chinese
merchant who came to Vancouver in the last century

<ICE-SIN:S2B-031#48:1:A>
They see themselves as Canadians and are concerned that the Hong
Kong influx may undo the efforts of Chinese who have been here for
generations

<ICE-SIN:S2B-031#49:1:A>
Money and numbers two advantages the newly arrived have which
immigrants in the past did not and this is also made them more resistant to
acculturation in a white society

<ICE-SIN:S2B-031#50:1:A>
Despite being a minority they have put in modern but Asian stamp on
Canadian society just as ethnic Chinese in other countries have done

<ICE-SIN:S2B-031#51:1:A>
But this has also raised the issue of how the Chinese must now
adapt to their homes

<ICE-SIN:S2B-031#52:1:A>
In November last year a conference was held in San Francisco to
discuss the legal political and economic status of the overseas Chinese today

<ICE-SIN:S2B-031#53:1:A>
Although acknowledging a common cultural heritage what was
important was the emphasis given to the need for ethnic Chinese to place
their sense of belonging in the countries they now find themselves

<ICE-SIN:S2B-031#54:1:A>
Michael Wu would not consider himself a China man

<ICE-SIN:S2B-031#55:1:A>
But he was the one running for the office of Mayor of Los Angeles
last month

<ICE-SIN:S2B-031#56:1:A>
Although unsuccessful Wu's efforts have continued the process of
weaving an Asian motiff into the fabric of American politics

<ICE-SIN:S2B-031#57:1:A>
During the early stages of the campaign Wu whose grandfather served
under doctor Soon Yat Sen shared his views on the challenges facing a
Chinese-American politician like himself

<ICE-SIN:S2B-031#58:1:A>
Broadway New York the cultural capital of America on the east coast

<ICE-SIN:S2B-031#59:1:A>
As in the political arena the grafting of Asian elements into
American culture has begun

<ICE-SIN:S2B-031#60:1:A>
Although opportunities for Asians are still paltry at least one
Broadway entertainer is optimistic that the tide will soon turn

<ICE-SIN:S2B-031#61:1:A>
He is Chris Phillips better known to his Asian fans as Fei Xiang

<ICE-SIN:S2B-031#62:1:A>
For many ethnic Chinese all over the world finding the place in the
new homes has made it necessary for them at one time or another to define
themselves and that definition can often be coloured by their ancient roots

<ICE-SIN:S2B-031#63:1:A>
But with the impending raise of East Asia especially China and the
dawn of the Pacific century will there be light or shadow cast on those who
still seek to retain their ancient Chinese roots </I>

New buildings are changing the face of Killiney road but many
old tenants are still here retaining its character

<ICE-SIN:S2B-031#65:2:B>
The Killiney kopi tiam or just plain number sixty-seven has a new
facet and spanking new interior

<ICE-SIN:S2B-031#66:2:B>
Gone are the rickety old waiters but its breakfast goodies are here
to stay

<ICE-SIN:S2B-031#67:2:B>
Tea or coffee is now seventy cents a cup but it's nice and strong
and it's only here that you can find Killiney french toast bread dip in
beaten egg toasted over charcoal and serve with a chunk of better and
home-made kaiya

<ICE-SIN:S2B-031#68:2:B>
Isn't it time you got some kaiya from number sixty-seven

<ICE-SIN:S2B-031#69:2:B>
In two months nearby households will have to look elsewhere for
their supplies when this shop gives way to a more modern business

<ICE-SIN:S2B-031#70:2:B>
But the barbers at number eighty-three intend to give many more
haircuts yet

<ICE-SIN:S2B-031#71:2:B>
No electric <unclear> word </unclear> here

<ICE-SIN:S2B-031#72:2:B>
Things are still done the good old way but if you have ten dollars
to spend you'll be treated like royalty

<ICE-SIN:S2B-031#73:2:B>
For some thirty years now mister Rajoo has been yielding his trusty
old scissors

<ICE-SIN:S2B-031#74:2:B>
So rest assured you'll be in good hands and bone-pumping massage
all part of the service

<ICE-SIN:S2B-031#75:2:B>
Tired of buying clothes off the rack

<ICE-SIN:S2B-031#76:2:B>
Mister Lim Peng Chuan of Wing Luen tailors will suit you up in
three days

<ICE-SIN:S2B-031#77:2:B>
Just next door one of the most famous frame-makers in Singapore the
Merlin Frame-makers

<ICE-SIN:S2B-031#78:2:B>
Started in nineteen seventy-four by mister Chan Chong Yan

<ICE-SIN:S2B-031#79:2:B>
With more than thirty years of experience choosing just the right
frame is second nature to mister Chan

<ICE-SIN:S2B-031#80:2:B>
There are three branches and a flatted factory but this shop still
serves faithful customers from the nearby Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts and
customers come from all over the island

<ICE-SIN:S2B-031#81:2:B>
There is nothing that mister Chan cannot frame Time for lunch

<ICE-SIN:S2B-031#82:2:B>
How about Cik Fatimah's super dupper nasi padang

<ICE-SIN:S2B-031#83:2:B>
It's a far cry from the original the shed they used to operate from
but trust me satisfaction is guaranteed </I>

Midway along busy Lavender Street is the Seng Heng coffeeshop
which still attracts customers despite its proximity to the Bugis Hawker
Centre

<ICE-SIN:S2B-031#85:3:C>
One reason is its unique version of char kway teow

<ICE-SIN:S2B-031#86:3:C>
Tay Cheng Lian now mans the stall opened by his grandfather and the
noodles just as tasty as when the old man fried them

<ICE-SIN:S2B-031#87:3:C>
Liberal splashes of stock make their version rather wet otherwise
the ingredients are similar to the char kway teow found elsewhere

<ICE-SIN:S2B-031#88:3:C>
You can always ask for additional helpings stable ingredients like
cockles cuttle-fish shrimp and fishcake

<ICE-SIN:S2B-031#89:3:C>
But what's really unique here is the topping of stewed minced pork
which is generously applied whether you're eating in or taking out

<ICE-SIN:S2B-031#90:3:C>
It may not be the traditional recipe but one thing's for sure

<ICE-SIN:S2B-031#91:3:C>
customers keep coming back for more </I>

These gleaming beauties lined up with more than two hundred
other cars at he Lau Pa Sat waiting the start of the nineteen ninety-three
heritage car

<ICE-SIN:S2B-031#93:4:D>
Clues were given only minutes to the flag-off so teams worked
feverishly to figure the first check point

<ICE-SIN:S2B-031#94:4:D>
A smooth start for most of the two hundred and thirty-four cars but
a temporary hiccup for this bashful vintage

<ICE-SIN:S2B-031#95:4:D>
Check point one was the National Museum where participants ran
about busily hunting for answers

<ICE-SIN:S2B-031#96:4:D>
Some teams relied on high-tech communications but the veterans had
it all figured out

<ICE-SIN:S2B-031#97:4:D>
Veterans like doctor Ivor Thavertasen

<ICE-SIN:S2B-031#98:4:D>
At check point number two the Central Manpower Base off Dempsey
road an auto test awaited the eager beamer driver who were more than keen to
show off their skill behind the wheel

<ICE-SIN:S2B-031#99:4:D>
At MacRitchie reservoir it was a scramble up to the Lim Bo Seng
memorial and the clues were well hidden With characters like the fat boys

<ICE-SIN:S2B-031#100:4:D>
How could the event be anything but a load of fun although the
Soon Yat Sun Villa in Ah Hood road doesn't normally entertain such noisy
visitors

<ICE-SIN:S2B-031#101:4:D>
It's back to the serious search for clues which brought
participants all the way to Mandai

<ICE-SIN:S2B-031#102:4:D>
And next the Lee rubber factory figuring that out is one thing

<ICE-SIN:S2B-031#103:4:D>
Kicking a cha-tek the required number of times is quite another

<ICE-SIN:S2B-031#104:4:D>
The clues pointed to an Esso station next all the way the other
side of the island in Tampines and participants squeezed into the office
hunger refreshments and more clues hidden inside <X>

<ICE-SIN:S2B-031#X105:4:D>
For some it was time ice-cream but for others there was still
more quiz questions to complete whether on their or with the help of unseen
consultants Back at the Lau Pa Sat the end of a hectic but satisfying morning
and no matter what the result time for a well-deserved rest </X> </I>
