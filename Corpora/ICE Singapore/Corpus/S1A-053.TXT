We haven't don't have a church uh uh I mean we thinking to do
that

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-053#20:1:C>
Don't think we hear <unclear> word </unclear> that our new
church will be built on time

<ICE-SIN:S1A-053#21:1:C>
We want to borrow your church Mount Carmel but there are three
churches in that one building

<ICE-SIN:S1A-053#22:1:C>
So our month the month that we pick is gonna be a really hot month
bat yu you know

<ICE-SIN:S1A-053#23:1:C>
So I I don't think it'll be it'll be available lah 'cause they told
us that even if we apply any earlier your church members will come first

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-053#24:1:B>
In fact we have actually seen some of them

<$C>

<ICE-SIN:S1A-053#62:1:A>
Oh yes definitely

<ICE-SIN:S1A-053#64:1:A>
Small little things which had a lot effect

<ICE-SIN:S1A-053#81:1:D>
It is almost ready

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-053#82:1:B>
It is fantastic you know

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-053#83:1:A>
That is if you know the lighting and everything

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-053#84:1:C>
Ya ya it is very

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-053#85:1:B>
And the sofa it doesn't look out of place what

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-053#86:1:C>
Ya it doesn't look green at all you know

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-053#87:1:B>
Fits very well fits very very well <O> Research assistant's
voice </O>

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-053#88:1:A>
Just found your place

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-053#89:1:B>
We found a small kabi hole somewhere at Yishun

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-053#90:1:C>
Ya

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-053#91:1:B>
So

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-053#92:1:C>
Everybody thinks it is too way out

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-053#93:1:B>
Ya

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-053#94:1:C>
Ya

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-053#95:1:B>
It is it is it's a it's a it is a cosy little place lah

<ICE-SIN:S1A-053#96:1:B>
I mean you roll around you basically can reach one end of the
skirting in the other

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-053#97:1:A>
With one roll one more to the other room

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-053#98:1:B>
So so it is quite it is quite a good place

<ICE-SIN:S1A-053#99:1:B>
Uh uh we are learning as we as we say lah learning a lot of things
from Peng Seng and Sally on how to set up the place how to

<$D> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-053#100:1:D>
To start with I think it is good to have a small home

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-053#101:1:A>
Correct they may want to

<$D> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-053#102:1:D>
comfortable small home you know don't don't go for too big a
home

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-053#103:1:C>
It is good

<ICE-SIN:S1A-053#104:1:C>
We can't afford anyway

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-053#105:1:A>
Ya

<$D> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-053#106:1:D>
You just get something you know which both of you are
comfortable with you know happy that is the most important

<ICE-SIN:S1A-053#107:1:D>
Don't have to <unclear> word </unclear>

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-053#108:1:C>
She is uh uh she is one of our sources of inspiration because
there were a lot of forces against us

<ICE-SIN:S1A-053#109:1:C>
What so small you know like a pig sty that is like oh we had felt
really moody but my sister was one of those lah who agrees because she went
through it you see

<ICE-SIN:S1A-053#110:1:C>
She had a small house and she first met him and got married

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-053#111:1:A>
Ya first home was about that small

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-053#112:1:C>
So first home was only one uh

<$D> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-053#113:1:D>
One bedroom

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-053#114:1:C>
One bedroom and one hall

<$D> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-053#115:1:D>
One living one dining one small little kitchenette

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-053#116:1:C>
Yes

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-053#117:1:B>
Actually actually for this kind of project it is very
important for the family to rally around 'cause you are you are really going
into the an unknown you see

<ICE-SIN:S1A-053#118:1:B>
I mean you are doing this for the first time It is good to get
support

<$D> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-053#119:1:D>
No you need support yes

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-053#120:1:B>
Our family never gave

<$D> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-053#121:1:D>
Moral support encouragement

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-053#122:1:C>
Really know getting it

<ICE-SIN:S1A-053#123:1:C>
It's like when somebody buys a house you will be happy right

<ICE-SIN:S1A-053#124:1:C>
We were so sad you know we were so moody for the first weeks you
know

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-053#125:1:B>
Ya ya ya ya

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-053#126:1:C>
Until we finally sink sank into the idea and got used to it
you know and we get more and more confident and we went to visit

<ICE-SIN:S1A-053#127:1:C>
We walked from the house till the M R T station

<ICE-SIN:S1A-053#128:1:C>
It took only about less than ten minutes

<ICE-SIN:S1A-053#129:1:C>
That really boosted our confidence

<ICE-SIN:S1A-053#130:1:C>
It's like wow this is a great place and then after that we visited
North Point and there was such a nice cinema

<ICE-SIN:S1A-053#131:1:C>
Ya ya we would even used you honey <unclear> word </unclear> you
look so

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-053#132:1:B>

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-053#156:1:B>
Pan Pacific

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-053#157:1:C>
One is Pan Pacific the other one was

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-053#158:1:A>
Maybe it is weekdays again is it

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-053#161:1:C>
Ya I never go Hilton again

<ICE-SIN:S1A-053#162:1:C>
I think it is too backward still in the colonial thinking

<$D> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-053#163:1:D>
So you all are all set for your wedding

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-053#164:1:C>

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-053#165:1:B>
Actually not

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-053#166:1:C>
Not set

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-053#167:1:B>
still got

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-053#168:1:C>
Got a lot of uh uh differences to iron out

<$D> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-053#169:1:D>
Like what

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-053#170:1:B>
Differences in our opinion

<$D> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-053#171:1:D>
For example

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-053#172:1:B>
Operating styles

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-053#173:1:C>
In operating style more like it in a depth of uh uh memory

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-053#174:1:B>
Rather lack of

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-053#175:1:C>
Depth of lack of what is

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-053#176:1:B>
She pointed to herself when she said

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-053#177:1:C>
Depth

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-053#178:1:B>
Depth of and pointed to me when she said lack of

<ICE-SIN:S1A-053#179:1:B>
For record purposes okay

<ICE-SIN:S1A-053#180:1:B>
Nicodemus hello there

<$D> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-053#181:1:D>
You must enjoy yourself while you prepare

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-053#182:1:A>
Ya ya

<$D> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-053#183:1:D>
For your wedding

<ICE-SIN:S1A-053#184:1:D>
Really it is a life long

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-053#185:1:B>
Actually where were

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-053#186:1:A>
Don't make it a chore

<$D> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-053#187:1:D>
Ya ya don't make it a chore

<ICE-SIN:S1A-053#188:1:D>
This is a once in a life time you won't have to go through this
another time you see and because the wedding itself

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-053#189:1:A>
Ya ya you you usually won't want to

<ICE-SIN:S1A-053#190:1:A>
And the wedding itself is only one day and it just passed by in
the snap of the eye

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-053#191:1:A>
So quickly

<$D> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-053#192:1:D>
Ya it is so fast you know

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-053#193:1:B>
But going on still got preparation and all that and in the
end when you do it uh uh it looks doesn't it feel so official right or not

<ICE-SIN:S1A-053#194:1:B>
They are not maybe not for yourself but I mean the logistics you
have to worry about this worry about that

<ICE-SIN:S1A-053#195:1:B>
In the end when you have it it is just like you are having a show
you know

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-053#196:1:A>
Ya ya I know

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-053#197:1:B>
Then that is it is finished

<ICE-SIN:S1A-053#198:1:B>
Full stop that is it

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-053#199:1:C>
Ya ya I think sometimes when you are so much like planning
you got so many things to do in the end it is like like putting up a show

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-053#200:1:B>
Ya

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-053#201:1:A>
Part of it is for yourself part of it is for your friends and
and

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-053#202:1:C>
Ya for family

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-053#203:1:A>
A big part is for your family

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-053#204:1:B>
Ya

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-053#205:1:A>
Not everything is for yourself

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-053#206:1:C>
Ya

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-053#207:1:B>
You know like that Malay I was talking to my Malay colleagues
the concept you know it is that you leave everything to your family members

<ICE-SIN:S1A-053#208:1:B>
They will plan the you know they plan the singing sessions

<ICE-SIN:S1A-053#209:1:B>
They will plan the food you know

gown
