<ICE-SIN:W2F-017#2:1>
What do you think your life would be like if you had
&dollar;20 million in your bank accounts and owned a penthouse suite worth
&dollar;10 million?

<ICE-SIN:W2F-017#3:1>
If your personal income was not less than
&dollar;100,000 a month?

<ICE-SIN:W2F-017#4:1>
If you had other convertible assets worth more than
&dollar;490 million?

<ICE-SIN:W2F-017#5:1>
You couldn't imagine it, could you?

<ICE-SIN:W2F-017#6:1>
It would be utterly inconceivable.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-017#7:1>
For Benny Weng it wasn't.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-017#8:1>
He was nauseated by the kind of life where money was no problem as far
as his personal needs were concerned.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-017#9:1>
For many years he had driven himself almost to the breaking-point to
reach the pinnacle.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-017#10:1>
The final goal seemed extremely hard to attain - still, he would give
it a determined try, though now he was beginning to doubt whether it was
worth the effort to be the richest man in Singapore.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-017#11:1>
It all boiled down to vanity, even madness.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-017#12:1>
When he was a boy, his paternal grandfather told him that the
post-war generation did not regard the pre-war big shots with awe and
obsequiousness.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-017#13:1>
Each generation viewed life differently.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-017#14:1>
Benny was fond of reflecting on his life in patches, going rapidly
forward and backward in time, as if time had a disjointed, perverted
continuity, and he was central to its unity.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-017#15:1>
Life here, he thought, was replete with lecturing.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-017#16:1>
He did it to people, and it seemed, more often, they to him.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-017#17:1>
After all, in his view this was the way of life on the island in
which he had been raised.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-017#18:1>
So hyper-rich was Benny that he didn't know what to do with his
money.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-017#19:1>
He had grown tired of transacting landed property.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-017#20:1>
Buying luxury motor cars and expensive personal items no longer had
any fascination for him.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-017#21:1>
The more he had the more problems he encountered managing and
securing what he owned.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-017#22:1>
As far as his personal acquisitions were concerned, he would never
allow someone else to look after them for him.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-017#23:1>
He prided himself in being the super managing director, ranking in
the distinguished company of personalities like Iacocca, Morita and others in
that league.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-017#24:1>
Being the top man in more than a dozen companies was arduous, yet he
was able to keep them all ticking in the black.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-017#25:1>
Although his wealth was comparable to that of the richest men in the
West, he somehow could not attract the same awe, respect or fame in his
society.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-017#26:1>
What was the recipe for his phenomenal success?

<ICE-SIN:W2F-017#27:1>
It could be glibly put as the possession of a business gene.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-017#28:1>
His other attributes completed the picture: shrewdness, acumen,
determination, persistence, courage, endurance, awareness of human
psychology, indefatigability and, above all, a penchant to succeed.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-017#29:1>
He took the trouble to keep abreast of market conditions: the latest
commercial information on tap kept him ahead of his rivals.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-017#30:1>
he did not tolerate indolence, incompetence or disloyalty on the part
of his staff.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-017#31:1>
He balanced ruthless efficiency with ample reward for labour, firm
overall control with managerial delegation, proprietary detachment with staff
camaraderie.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-017#32:1>
He was aware that he was more respected than loved by those who
worked under him, more feared than admired.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-017#33:1>
Believing firmly that money talked, he set aside a generous slice of
the profits for his staff, paying them according to their productivity,
encouraging them to buy shares in the companies he owned.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-017#34:1>
They had to slog, not as mindless workaholics, but with a sense of
direction.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-017#35:1>
Competition being fierce, they had to quickly adapt themselves to
sudden changes in production, work schedules, technology and overseas market
demand.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-017#36:1>
On one occasion during a recession he had no compunction to lay off
twenty workers in one of his factories in order to introduce automation and
cut cost.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-017#37:1>
There was a time when he spent his personal money with abandon, when
losing a cool million dollars in a gamble was just a minor irritation.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-017#38:1>
Benny was not a gambler, but like all rich and successful
businessmen, he allowed himself an occasional wager.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-017#39:1>
He never used the cash of his business concerns to play stakes - he
was too scrupulous for that.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-017#40:1>
To him, his money and that of his firms were distinctly separate.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-017#41:1>
He played the stock exchange more for fun than gain.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-017#42:1>
At first he was thrilled to make massive profits - it also gave him
satisfaction to recoup what he lost.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-017#43:1>
But after a year the routine of buying and selling became a bore.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-017#44:1>
So he tried his hand at commodities, followed by gold.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-017#45:1>
He didn't fare well in either, as it was impossible to know in
advance every facet of those distinctive types of business.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-017#46:1>
Because time was involved, he was not keen in playing futures.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-017#47:1>
There was one rule he strictly imposed upon himself: no hard-core
gambling at the race track or in the gambling dens.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-017#48:1>
He scrupulously avoided card games because his father, an amateur
magician, had shown him as a boy how, by sleight of hand, he was able to fish
aces for himself from a pack.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-017#49:1>
He joined the exclusive clubs to play golf, to take executive meals
or to wallow in the company of the hostesses during, but mostly after, the 'happy
hour'.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-017#50:1>
He drank moderately, was always in control of himself.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-017#51:1>
And he travelled exclusively, mixing business with pleasure,
constantly conscious of taking all the precautions against AIDS.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-017#52:1>
He always went first class, was always generous with tips.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-017#53:1>
He had reached a stage where he had bought everything he personally
required, having toyed with many models of limousines and continually
updating his home audio equipment.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-017#54:1>
He was no indiscriminate consumer, nor was he a compulsive one.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-017#55:1>
Long business experience had taught him to buy the best actually
needed at the lowest price.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-017#56:1>
In this sense he couldn't see eye to eye with his wife, who seemed
extravagant to no purpose.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-017#57:1>
For her, the need to maintain her social standing was paramount.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-017#58:1>
What was money for but to be spent?

<ICE-SIN:W2F-017#59:1>
She considered her husband a miser in this respect.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-017#60:1>
" What do you want from life, Ben?" a business friend asked him.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-017#61:1>
" Well, I really don't know.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-017#62:1>
I still have the ambition to be the richest man in Singapore.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-017#63:1>
Having achieved that, I don't know what more I want.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-017#64:1>
Having so much money, having no children, life is becoming sort of
meaningless.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-017#65:1>
The publicity I get is poor recompense."

<ICE-SIN:W2F-017#66:1>
He would be shocked if he were to know that the ordinary men in the
street cared not two hoots who he was, how much he owned or the lifestyle he
led.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-017#67:1>
To them he was only a name.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-017#68:1>
The people's concept of values had changed.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-017#69:1>
They were no longer entranced by stories of those who became
fabulously rich, specially those who made it from rags to riches.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-017#70:1>
They couldn't care much for that - after all, it wasn't their wealth.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-017#71:1>
One evening in December he was sitting on the lambskin armchair
staring at the mirror he had purposely put up - it was obviously a habit he
had of late succumbed to.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-017#72:1>
There was no doubt he admired his designer shirt which came together
with a diamond fountain pen.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-017#73:1>
His hair was combed neatly in the style of the sleek Hollywood screen
lover of the late Twenties.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-017#74:1>
His face was scarred, as if it was caused by the vicissitudes of his
early manhood.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-017#75:1>
There were stern lines etched around his eyes.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-017#76:1>
When he pursed his thin lips, he gave away the stubborn determination
in him.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-017#77:1>
After some time he stood up, a man of average build who was
surprisingly slim considering that he ate well, in fact more than was good
for him.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-017#78:1>
He rose, then walked to the door.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-017#79:1>
He had to attend an important business gathering. </I>

<I>

<ICE-SIN:W2F-017#80:2>
<h> Singaporama </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2F-017#81:2>
" Why, if it's not ..." The portly man in the white habit looked at
Benny who had by then almost reached the peak of success in business.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-017#82:2>
" Your face looks familiar.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-017#83:2>
Sorry, I can't exactly place you."

<ICE-SIN:W2F-017#84:2>
" Patrick Choo.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-017#85:2>
Can't you recognize your former schoolmate, Ben?

<ICE-SIN:W2F-017#86:2>
Catholic High, 1960." He knew Benny as a scruffy, mischievous lad
whose parents always paid his school fees late.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-017#87:2>
" Oh, yes.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-017#88:2>
You look so different now, Patrick." In school, Patrick was a
happy-go-lucky student with a pimply face.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-017#89:2>
" You're married?"

<ICE-SIN:W2F-017#90:2>
" Yes, several months ago to Grace.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-017#91:2>
Her father's the famous tycoon Wee." This made Ben recall that
Patrick used to go about with a girl.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-017#92:2>
However, he thought it prudent not to ask the priest what happened to
her.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-017#93:2>
" You've been featured quite often in some international business
magazines.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-017#94:2>
I read that you've done exceptionally well in life," Patrick Choo
observed with a very slight hint of cynicism.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-017#95:2>
He subtly implied that Benny could have done better in regard to his
spiritual life but it seemed lost on the business magnate.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-017#96:2>
" I'm among the top ten richest men in Singapore.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-017#97:2>
I'm so loaded I can buy whatever I want.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-017#98:2>
And you, Patrick, I see, have become a priest," Benny retorted.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-017#99:2>
Obviously the cynicism had not escaped him.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-017#100:2>
" Yes, I was seven years in Eire, attached to a seminary in
Kilkenny.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-017#101:2>
I returned to Singapore last year ..."

<ICE-SIN:W2F-017#102:2>
" I should address you as Father Choo, then."

<ICE-SIN:W2F-017#103:2>
" As you like, Ben."

<ICE-SIN:W2F-017#104:2>
" You know, Father, I'm a free-thinker."

<ICE-SIN:W2F-017#105:2>
" To each man his own belief, though I find it hard to concede
free-thinking as a faith."

<ICE-SIN:W2F-017#106:2>
" It's a modern trend ..."

<ICE-SIN:W2F-017#107:2>
" My friend, it's neither the time nor place to discuss this.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-017#108:2>
If you can find time to come to my church in Katong, I'd be glad to
give you my views." The priest extracted a booklet from the pocket of his
habit.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-017#109:2>
" You'll find the address and other details in it."

<ICE-SIN:W2F-017#110:2>
" Thanks, Father.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-017#111:2>
But I don't think ..."

<ICE-SIN:W2F-017#112:2>
" Never mind.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-017#113:2>
Only if you wish to do so.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-017#114:2>
By the way, Ben, since you're so rich, wouldn't you want to donate
to a charity supported by my church?" Benny stiffened.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-017#115:2>
" On prinicple, I never donate anything to charity."

<ICE-SIN:W2F-017#116:2>
" How's that?"

<ICE-SIN:W2F-017#117:2>
" Well, it isn't my responsibility to subsidize the poor or the
underprivileged." " It is astonishing coming from you, Ben.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-017#118:2>
You are part of our society.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-017#119:2>
Therefore, you have a moral obligation to help the unfortunate, the
handicapped, the aged poor."

<ICE-SIN:W2F-017#120:2>
" Society did nothing for me when I was a boy.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-017#121:2>
You know I went through school the hard way.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-017#122:2>
I didn't have the things my schoolmates had.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-017#123:2>
No one helped or pitied me.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-017#124:2>
Even my parents regarded it a chore to raise me.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-017#125:2>
Yet I made good."

<ICE-SIN:W2F-017#126:2>
" My request to you is entirely voluntary.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-017#127:2>
Maybe we can discuss charity the next time we meet.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-017#128:2>
It's more blessed to give than to receive.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-017#129:2>
Ben, I've got to go."

<ICE-SIN:W2F-017#130:2>
" Goodbye, Father." As he watched the retreating figure, he told
himself indignantly that Patrick might as well have quoted the needle and the
camel's eye to him.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-017#131:2>
Benny did not visit Father Choo at the church.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-017#132:2>
He was too busy with his business commitments, and devoted much of
his time to taking his newly-wed wife out in his Jaguar.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-017#133:2>
When he was walking to his car one day, it crossed his mind that he
had not visited his favourite aunt, his mother's cousin, for quite some time.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-017#134:2>
Aunt Evelyn was one of the few women in this world that he cared
for.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-017#135:2>
She became a Catholic after having married one.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-017#136:2>
In the evening Benny drove his car to her bungalow in the western
sector of the island.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-017#137:2>
Arriving there, he was welcomed by his uncle, Albert Tay, a gaunt
man with an amiable mien.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-017#138:2>
Presently his aunt, looking haggard, appeared and he greeted her, at
the same time he noticed that her short stature was accentuated by a stoop
which she never had before.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-017#139:2>
She insisted that he stay for dinner with them; he politely declined
because he had to take his wife out to a party.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-017#140:2>
Uncle Tay confided to him that his Aunt Evelyn had been ill for some
time.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-017#141:2>
He had kept the matter secret from all the relatives.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-017#142:2>
But now he had to tell Benny about it. <X>

<ICE-SIN:W2F-017#X143:2>
" What's wrong with her, Uncle?"

<ICE-SIN:W2F-017#X144:2>
" Cancer of the liver."

<ICE-SIN:W2F-017#X145:2>
" Does Aunt Evelyn know about it?"

<ICE-SIN:W2F-017#X146:2>
" No.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-017#X147:2>
But she suspects I'm hiding something from her.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-017#X148:2>
Should the cancer spread, she'll have less than a month to live."
</X> </I>
