<ICE-SIN:S1A-079#214:2:C>
Because I've done that

<$D> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-079#215:2:D>
Exactly

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-079#216:2:C>
But it's easy if something you studied before

<$D> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-079#217:2:D>
So isn't that what university education about

<ICE-SIN:S1A-079#218:2:D>
Training your mind

<ICE-SIN:S1A-079#219:2:D>
Having the ability now to pick up any book that you want to read
and teach yourself

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-079#220:2:C>
Wah

<$D> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-079#221:2:D>
No exactly

<ICE-SIN:S1A-079#222:2:D>
Now physics is possible

<ICE-SIN:S1A-079#223:2:D>
Right

<ICE-SIN:S1A-079#224:2:D>
I mean can read anything anything new and absorb new ideas right

<ICE-SIN:S1A-079#225:2:D>
The thing is it might possible and simple

<ICE-SIN:S1A-079#226:2:D>
Not it's not simple it's hard

<ICE-SIN:S1A-079#227:2:D>
But the thing is it's possible

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-079#228:2:C>
Just now when you paged me did you write down your number
yourself

<$D> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-079#229:2:D>
No I did not

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-079#230:2:C>
It came as 354 0026

<ICE-SIN:S1A-079#231:2:C>
So I keep calling this family

<ICE-SIN:S1A-079#232:2:C>
When this little kid picked up the phone and say Mummy and Daddy
are at work

<ICE-SIN:S1A-079#233:2:C>
Who paged me

<$D> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-079#234:2:D>
No I never put down my one

<ICE-SIN:S1A-079#235:2:D>
I just put the double

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-079#236:2:C>
Now it just came out like that

<ICE-SIN:S1A-079#237:2:C>
That's why I was wondering who was it

<ICE-SIN:S1A-079#238:2:C>
Paged me

<$D> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-079#239:2:D>
Am I supposed to speakers come out with someone ah

<ICE-SIN:S1A-079#240:2:D>
Agree to the recording

<ICE-SIN:S1A-079#241:2:D>
Was Singapore is a project of the <unclear> word <unclear>

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-079#242:2:C>
Wah mashiaolah

<ICE-SIN:S1A-079#243:2:C>
It sounds like that meh

<$D> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-079#244:2:D>
Yeah <unclear> word <unclear>

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-079#245:2:C>
Ah OK

<$D> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-079#246:2:D>
Say second is my mum told me when I was a kid

<ICE-SIN:S1A-079#247:2:D>
And it just start off

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-079#248:2:C>
OK

<$D> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-079#249:2:D>
And it was good what I'm supposed to take

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-079#250:2:C>
No no no

<ICE-SIN:S1A-079#251:2:C>
No it's just

<$D> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-079#252:2:D>
If you want to be ornamous I don't care

<ICE-SIN:S1A-079#253:2:D>
I want to be famous

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-079#254:2:C>
<O> Laughing </O>

<$D> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-079#255:2:D>
So you guys know

<ICE-SIN:S1A-079#256:2:D>
<unclear> word <unclear> What do you research this for anyway

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-079#257:2:C>
And it's to study how like regional speakers or something

<ICE-SIN:S1A-079#258:2:C>
So like how Malay speak English

<ICE-SIN:S1A-079#259:2:C>
Do you have lah loh after all you know

<$D> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-079#260:2:D>
Yes

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-079#261:2:C>
Code-switching

<$D> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-079#262:2:D>
Do you want me to speak like that now

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-079#263:2:C>
No

<$D> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-079#264:2:D>
Or speak how are you

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-079#265:2:C>
Yeah speak how are you

<ICE-SIN:S1A-079#266:2:C>
Speak normally

<$D> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-079#267:2:D>
OK

<ICE-SIN:S1A-079#268:2:D>
No I've done this several times but not for this specific reason
but for other reasons

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-079#269:2:C>
How if I don't get this

<ICE-SIN:S1A-079#270:2:C>
Ayah

<$D> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-079#271:2:D>
Not that serious

<ICE-SIN:S1A-079#272:2:D>
Come on

<ICE-SIN:S1A-079#273:2:D>
I mean there are options available

<ICE-SIN:S1A-079#274:2:D>
I know how to feel but it could be the same way

<ICE-SIN:S1A-079#275:2:D>
It's like right now I just don't have the energy almost to do
anything

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-079#276:2:C>
Yeah I'm just waiting for me to work for for for like three
months on project basis

<$D> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-079#277:2:D>
Well I don't want this type of working meh

<ICE-SIN:S1A-079#278:2:D>
Fuck you

<ICE-SIN:S1A-079#279:2:D>
I don't like this type of working

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-079#280:2:C>
Dee dee

<ICE-SIN:S1A-079#281:2:C>
Censor

<$D> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-079#282:2:D>
Look

<ICE-SIN:S1A-079#283:2:D>
You <{> <[> told me to speak normally </[>

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-079#284:2:C>
<[> OK

<ICE-SIN:S1A-079#285:2:C>
I know </[> </{>

<ICE-SIN:S1A-079#286:2:C>
I know

<ICE-SIN:S1A-079#287:2:C>
I know

<$D> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-079#288:2:D>
I'm speaking normally here

<ICE-SIN:S1A-079#289:2:D>
Ha I mean like I mean

<ICE-SIN:S1A-079#290:2:D>
OK my broo works

<ICE-SIN:S1A-079#291:2:D>
But he is married I know

<ICE-SIN:S1A-079#292:2:D>
And he doesn't earn enough to even feed himself and his wife

<ICE-SIN:S1A-079#293:2:D>
And he just bought a car and all that

<ICE-SIN:S1A-079#294:2:D>
So my mum is sort of supporting the family

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-079#295:2:C>
Why

<ICE-SIN:S1A-079#296:2:C>
Why he

<ICE-SIN:S1A-079#297:2:C>
Why doesn't he change work then

<$D> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-079#298:2:D>
No no

<ICE-SIN:S1A-079#299:2:D>
I mean he has lots of prospects

<ICE-SIN:S1A-079#300:2:D>
He has good relationship with his immediate superiors

<ICE-SIN:S1A-079#301:2:D>
He just got a diploma which were good recognised and his good
working attitude

<ICE-SIN:S1A-079#302:2:D>
They like him <X>

<ICE-SIN:S1A-079#X303:2:D>
So I would give him two three more... The only thing is he only
has the confidence no more In Singapore we all know your how much your paper
qualification counts So if he stays there I would say within the next five
years he would

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-079#X304:2:C>
Five years he will wait you know

<$D> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-079#X305:2:D>
Five years he would go up He would be have quite huge high
level I would have to start talk to him about that you know Cos he doesn't
really know about promotions job prospects and all that increments He's a bit
blur lah So I mean that's a good task for me to start working as soon as
possible Yet at the same time I don't want to work

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-079#X306:2:C>
Exactly But I have to work

<$D> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-079#X307:2:D>
No I felt this way twice before After <Besent> college
Canada and national service this emptiness spoiled...

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-079#X308:2:C>
<unclear> word <unclear>

<$D> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-079#X309:2:D>
Yeah but... Yeah I'm doing the same thing like you I'm
helping out the CSLL <unclear> word <unclear> I'm most probably be conducting
extra lessons for the kids at AMP and all that uh I'm really teaching myself
quantum mechanics and relativity and all that Yet it doesn't do you feel joy

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-079#X310:2:C>
Yeah definitely

<$D> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-079#X311:2:D>
You just feel like... I'm just going into that emotion I'm
feeling from day to day waiting for my fucking results to come out and
then...

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-079#X312:2:C>
When is yours coming out Mine is the 4th of June

<$D> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-079#X313:2:D>
The day before yours On the day on the 4th I'll be coming to
check if I get honours or not Most probably I will not get it

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-079#X314:2:C>
<unclear> word <unclear>

<$D> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-079#X315:2:D>
What

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-079#X316:2:C>
Honours

<$D> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-079#X317:2:D>
Yeah The letter with... They will posted on the notice board

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-079#X318:2:C>
This is another thing I don't even know if I can get it Even
if I get it I don't even know that I'll work at it

<$D> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-079#X319:2:D>
Yeah that's another thing for me also I'm just tired of
exams I'm fucking tired The one paper statistics mechanics <unclear> word
<unclear> which I can't I couldn't afford to <screw> up and it was an easy
paper and that made it worse because the module was " Yeah it's OK ah" So for
me I couldn't do it because I just got so tired you know I just... And to
make matters worse four days later I was sitting in the Physics Department
area and that same professor came down and saw me He came up saying " Ai come
on <unclear> word <unclear> I really enjoy your paper" This is the not an
exam research paper we are asked to do " I really enjoy your paper It's
original It's the first paper that I read and..." she didn't say explicitly
but you one was thinking no other paper came close to it in terms of you know
originality and thought Cos that module was basically just reading from
somewhere processing and just reduplicating in their own words <unclear> word
<unclear> But I felt so bad we don't have time to talk but only say " Ei I'm
sorry I <screwed> up your exam" But in fact she is a good teacher I feel let
let him down

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-079#X320:2:C>
Can have dinner lah actually <unclear> word <unclear>

<$D> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-079#X321:2:D>
Yeah that's what I'm thinking But can do you have enough
money to pay for me

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-079#X322:2:C>
Like fifteen dollars OK

<$D> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-079#X323:2:D>
I can send you both if you have any extra <unclear> word
<unclear>

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-079#X324:2:C>
No I got twelve dollars

<$D> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-079#X325:2:D>
<unclear> word <unclear>

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-079#X326:2:C>
I got twelve dollars

<$D> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-079#X327:2:D>
Well

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-079#X328:2:C>
You can eat something with twelve dollars

<$D> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-079#X329:2:D>
Now I was thinking of some hawker centres <unclear> word
<unclear>

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-079#X330:2:C>

No sometimes I got so angry with my books or doing something
Can lah five more minutes five more minutes five more minutes five more
minutes It's like one hour <unclear> word <unclear>

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-079#X338:2:C>

Because nothing that books could actually fill up

<$D> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-079#X343:2:D>
