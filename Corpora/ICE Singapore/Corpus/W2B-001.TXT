<h> Profile </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-001#2:1>
Goh Chok Tong was born in Singapore on May 20, 1941.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-001#3:1>
Life was not a bed of roses for the young Goh, the eldest of five
children.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-001#4:1>
Their father died when Goh was nine years old, leaving their mother, a
Chinese school teacher, now in her 70s, to fend for them.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-001#5:1>
With his mother at work, the children were left to be raised mostly by
their grandmother, an uncle and an aunt.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-001#6:1>
At one point, in Upper Six, he almost left school to work as a
journalist because his family needed the money.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-001#7:1>
The Goh family shared a pre-war house at Pasir Panjang with three or
four families.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-001#8:1>
He had a tiny room to himself.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-001#9:1>
" It was no more than seven or eight feet across.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-001#10:1>
I know because when I slept, I just fitted in," said Goh, who
measures 6 feet 2 inches in height.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-001#11:1>
Dr Tan Cheng Bock, MP for Ayer Rajah and Goh's schoolmate, recalled
that Goh's room was extremely spartan, with a kerosene lamp on a table and
books lining the walls, including some Russian novels.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-001#12:1>
" Everyone else in those days was reading comics, and there he was
reading such serious, difficult books," said Dr Tan.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-001#13:1>
Goh attended Raffles Institution, the same English-medium premier
school that Lee Kuan Yew went to.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-001#14:1>
A teacher remembered him as " a well-behaved and disciplined youth,
well-liked by his teachers.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-001#15:1>
At the early age of 14, he already showed leadership qualities".

<ICE-SIN:W2B-001#16:1>
Goh was a troop leader of the Boy Scouts, vice-head prefect, editor
of the school magazine and captain of the school's swimming team.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-001#17:1>
Philip Liau, a former teacher, described Goh as respectful and " an
upright, honest, decent sort of boy".

<ICE-SIN:W2B-001#18:1>
Eugene Wijeysingha, Principal of Raffles Institution and Goh's
teacher then, said: " As a school prefect, in the swimming team, in every
assignment he was given, he took them all very seriously.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-001#19:1>
He was organised and fair and much more mature than the general run
of the students.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-001#20:1>
One sort of gets the impression that he was carrying the weight of
the world on his shoulder".

<ICE-SIN:W2B-001#21:1>
Dr Tan said Goh was shy and a loner.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-001#22:1>
" He only truly relaxed when he was with friends".

<ICE-SIN:W2B-001#23:1>
On one occasion, Tan said, they were all trying to learn the rock and
roll but Goh just sat there and laughed at their antics.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-001#24:1>
Academically, Goh was a late bloomer.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-001#25:1>
Despite his diligence, he did not impress with his secondary school
performance.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-001#26:1>
A classmate, now a lawyer, recalled Goh was placed somewhere between
10th and 20th during his time from 1955 to 1958.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-001#27:1>
" Maybe he concentrated his energies on scouting activities camping,
hiking and excursions," a teacher quipped.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-001#28:1>
As a schoolboy, Goh aspired to be a good writer and political
limelight was something he never dreamt of.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-001#29:1>
Some of his essays were so well-written that his teacher read them to
classes in the upper forms.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-001#30:1>
He used to write poems, too, some of which appeared in the school
magazine.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-001#31:1>
At that time, anti-colonial sentiments were running high on the
island.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-001#32:1>
A schoolmate said: " He was always writing something or other about
Singapore.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-001#33:1>
We were all then caught up in the spirit of those times".

<ICE-SIN:W2B-001#34:1>
But Goh, who won several prizes for his writing, said he was not
really caught up in the struggle for independence like his uncle and aunt,
though he followed them to rallies.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-001#35:1>
In 1958, as chairman of the school Historical Society, Goh invited an
old Rafflesian and a lawyer-politician to give a talk.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-001#36:1>
The speaker, Lee Kuan Yew, the Opposition Leader then, spoke on "
Landmarks of Democracy in Malaya".

<ICE-SIN:W2B-001#37:1>
That was the first time Goh met his future mentor.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-001#38:1>
On that occasion, Goh said that politics never entered his mind.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-001#39:1>
Little did he know that 32 years later, he would take over the reins
of Singapore from that man.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-001#40:1>
Goh proceeded to the University of Singapore on a grant.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-001#41:1>
For a while, he could not make up his mind whether to read English or
Economics.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-001#42:1>
Finally, he opted for Economics " because of the practical streak in
me".

<ICE-SIN:W2B-001#43:1>
As it turned out, he made the right choice.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-001#44:1>
In 1964, he graduated with a first-class honours in Economics.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-001#45:1>
Two years later, while working in the Singapore Administrative
Service, an elite branch of the civil service, he was awarded a fellowship to
the prestigious Williams College in the Northeastern American state of
Massachusetts.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-001#46:1>
There, he topped his class and earned a Master of Arts degree in
Development Economics.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-001#47:1>
Goh is a very private person who does not want to reveal too much
about his personal life.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-001#48:1>
On November 17, 1990, however, he gave a rare insight into how he was
coaxed into entering politics.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-001#49:1>
The occasion was the 20th anniversary dinner of the National Trade
Union Congress Income, the insurance arm of Singapore's most influential
trade union body.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-001#50:1>
Appealing to reluctant Singaporeans to step forward to serve the
nation, he said: " I am not a natural in politics and I never dreamt of
becoming a minister".

<ICE-SIN:W2B-001#51:1>
His first ambition after graduation was to obtain doctorate and
become a professor.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-001#52:1>
He enrolled at the University of Singapore and had even picked "
Capital Formation and Economic Growth" as his research topic.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-001#53:1>
Two weeks after he started, the Vice-Chancellor informed him that the
government would not release him from his five-year bond and wanted him to
return and serve as an administrative officer in the Economic Planning Unit.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-001#54:1>
A year later, he applied for a job with Shell.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-001#55:1>
After series of tests, including a lunch to observe how he behaved
socially, he got the job with a loan to pay up his bond.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-001#56:1>
" So I resigned from the Civil Service, brought forward my marriage
so that I could go for my honeymoon before starting on the new job and
happily went off with my wife to Malaysia".

<ICE-SIN:W2B-001#57:1>
Halfway through his honeymoon, he received a telegram from Shell
asking him to return as soon as possible.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-001#58:1>
He thought they needed his service immediately, but it turned out
that Dr Goh Keng Swee, the Deputy Prime Minister then, was unhappy that Shell
was poaching him and wanted him back at the EPU.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-001#59:1>
Shell told him that if he insisted on joining the company, it would
still take him on.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-001#60:1>
Sensing the predicament of the company, he decided to return to the
EPU.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-001#61:1>
In August 1969, he was seconded to the Neptune Oriental Lines,
Singapore's national shipping line, as its Planning and Projects Manager.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-001#62:1>
He later became its Financial Director and finally, in November,
1973, its Managing Director.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-001#63:1>
" I was very happy there.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-001#64:1>
I thought I had found my niche in life running a shipping company,"
Goh said of his stint with the loss-making company which he helped turn
around within a few short years.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-001#65:1>
Then came the turning point in 1976 when Hon Sui Sen, the Finance
Minister then, asked him to stand for elections.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-001#66:1>
" I was surprised.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-001#67:1>
I was not a good public speaker.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-001#68:1>
I don't speak Malay and I don't speak Mandarin.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-001#69:1>
I had no grassroots experience, and had not shown the slightest
interest in politics," Goh said.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-001#70:1>
Hon persuaded him, saying he was getting old and needed someone to
take over from him and that it was important for able young Singaporeans to
succeed the older political leaders.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-001#71:1>
" So here I am, a politician, and a shipping director or chairman.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-001#72:1>
My initial bond to serve the government for five years has become a
bond for life.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-001#73:1>
But I have no regrets.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-001#74:1>
It is very satisfying to be able to contribute my bit to the welfare
of our nation," he said.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-001#75:1>
Goh was elected Member of Parliament for the Marine Parade
constituency in the 1976 General Election.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-001#76:1>
In the 1980 polls, he was returned unopposed.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-001#77:1>
He won again in the same ward in the 1984 and 1988 polls, the last as
a member of a three-man team under the new Group Representation Constituency
electoral scheme.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-001#78:1>
A year after his maiden electoral victory, Goh gave up his top job in
the national shipping company to take up the post of Senior Minister of State
in he Finance Ministry.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-001#79:1>
In March 1979, at the age of 38, he presented his first Budget to
Parliament.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-001#80:1>
Soon after that, he became a full Minister in the newly created
Minister for Trade and Industry.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-001#81:1>
He assumed the additional portfolio of Health in January 1981 but
gave up his Trade and Industry portfolio in June the same year to become
Second Minister for Defence.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-001#82:1>
At the beginning of June 1982, he was appointed Defence Minister, a
post he still holds today.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-001#83:1>
To help complete the implementation of the Medisave health scheme
which he initiated, he retained his presence in the Health Ministry as its
Second Minister.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-001#84:1>
The multi-role exposure and the increasingly important duties he
assumed clearly pointed to bigger things to come his way.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-001#85:1>
The December 1984 General Election was a watershed in Goh's political
career.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-001#86:1>
In an unprecedented setback, the PAP lost two of the 79 seats, along
with a 12.6 percentage-point drop in its popular vote.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-001#87:1>
The signal from the voters, particularly the younger ones, was clear:
they want a more open and less paternalistic government.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-001#88:1>
Being more attuned to the changing mood of the electorate, Goh easily
won the approval of his peers with his consultative style of leadership.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-001#89:1>
At a private meeting several days after the General Election, the
younger-generation PAP core-group ministers unanimously picked Goh as their
leader.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-001#90:1>
Parliament Speaker Tan Soo Khoon said: " He was elected by the
younger-generation because they felt his style was appropriate to the
changing times.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-001#91:1>
His style of listening to people, of considering other people's
views, suits today's generation which likes to be heard".

<ICE-SIN:W2B-001#92:1>
Goh was named First Deputy Prime Minister in a Cabinet reshuffle on
December 31, 1984.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-001#93:1>
In that capacity, he was implicitly the heir-apparent to succeed PM
Lee.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-001#94:1>
The home stretch of Goh's ascendancy to premiership was, however, not
completely uneventful.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-001#95:1>
For some time, there was wide speculation that BG Lee, the
fast-rising star in Singapore politics, might overtake Goh in the "
succession race".

<ICE-SIN:W2B-001#96:1>
As it turned out, Goh won the final re-endorsement of the younger
leaders in July 1988 and went on to become the republic's second Prime
Minister on November 28, l990.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-001#97:1>
At the party level, Goh had a meteoric rise, too.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-001#98:1>
In 1979, just three years into politics, he became the PAP Second
Assistant Secretary-General and chief election strategist.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-001#99:1>
Since then, the party has landslide wins in three General Elections
in 1980, 1984 and 1988.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-001#100:1>
Goh was also instrumental in setting up and running PAP's
sophisticated talent-recruiting system since 1979.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-001#101:1>
He is now the First Assistant Secretary-General.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-001#102:1>
He has chosen to remain in the No 2 slot and let the elder Lee
retain the post of Secretary General " as long as he wishes" in recognition
of Lee's contribution to the party and the nation.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-001#103:1>
On and off the political arena, praise comes readily for the new
Prime Minister.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-001#104:1>
" You feel comfortable with him.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-001#105:1>
He has no airs.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-001#106:1>
He is a straight-forward man.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-001#107:1>
You don't have to guess at what he is thinking because he will
always tell you what's on his mind...," said S Puhaindran, a grassroots
leader in Goh's Marine Parade constituency since 1976.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-001#108:1>
Schoolmate Dr.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-001#109:1>
Tan Cheng Bock said: " Chok is from a humble background and he cares
for the ordinary man".

<ICE-SIN:W2B-001#110:1>
Banker Tan Jee Say, Goh's former principal private secretary, said
he was approachable, unassuming and unpretentious.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-001#111:1>
" You can walk up to him and talk like a friend".

<ICE-SIN:W2B-001#112:1>
" He is not one of the ultra sensitive types," a civil servant
observed.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-001#113:1>
" He's able to take fairly strong criticism without going
immediately on the defensive.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-001#114:1>
He's quite cool and gracious".

<ICE-SIN:W2B-001#115:1>
A nice guy, yes, but those who know him say it is foolish to
underestimate the man.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-001#116:1>
" He's no softie," said Dr Tan.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-001#117:1>
" He's not so simple.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-001#118:1>
He makes decision.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-001#119:1>
He's not a man of many words but a man of substance.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-001#120:1>
He's got vision and he's got purpose".

<ICE-SIN:W2B-001#121:1>
When Goh makes a decision, he will see it to its logical conclusion.
<X>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-001#X122:1>
" Once he has made up his mind, it's difficult to make him let go,"
said MP Ow Chin Hock.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-001#X123:1>
In a party that admits only the best talent, Goh is a remarkable
team player who is unafraid of being surrounded by able men. </X> </I>
