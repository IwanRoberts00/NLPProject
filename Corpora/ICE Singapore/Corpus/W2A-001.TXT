<h> 1) INVESTING IN REAL ESTATE </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-001#2:1>
" Ninety per cent of all millionaires became so through owning real
estate".

<ICE-SIN:W2A-001#3:1>
Andrew Carnegie A Guarantee for Capital Growth and a Hedge against
Inflation Many people have made their fortunes through investments in real
estate which produces rental income as well as capital gains.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-001#4:1>
Land is scarce in Singapore and it is becoming increasingly difficult
to find affordable land for private housing development.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-001#5:1>
Singapore has developed into a modern cosmopolitan state with many
multi-national corporations setting their bases or offices here, the value of
residential, commercial and industrial real estate must naturally rise with
the growth of the state and the passage of time.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-001#6:1>
Official statistics confirm this.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-001#7:1>
Demand for land in Singapore will always exceed supply.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-001#8:1>
Land cannot be manufactured as cars can.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-001#9:1>
Moreover, the costs of construction and labour are always on the rise.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-001#10:1>
These factors contribute towards the certain increase in the value of
real estate.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-001#11:1>
Only political instability and internal strife or world wide economic
depression can disrupt the upward trend.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-001#12:1>
As Singapore advances into the twenty-first century, property
investment is a preferred investment.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-001#13:1>
An Economics teacher, who migrated from China to Singapore about
thirty years ago, now owns three houses.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-001#14:1>
He lives in comfortable retirement.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-001#15:1>
He once said that the secret of his retirement plan lay in real
estate.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-001#16:1>
All his savings went into property which he bought during his working
life.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-001#17:1>
The value of his property had increased more than 20 times its
original value.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-001#18:1>
His words of wisdom were: " The value of property must go up as a
matter of course as the country develops into a modern state.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-001#19:1>
It is not luck.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-001#20:1>
It is certainty".

<ICE-SIN:W2A-001#21:1>
No Capital Gains Tax in Singapore Makes Real Estate an Attractive
Investment.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-001#22:1>
There is no capital gains tax in Singapore.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-001#23:1>
Let us hope it stays that way.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-001#24:1>
Capital gains tax is the tax charged in respect of gains accruing to
a person on the disposal of his capital assets.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-001#25:1>
The term " assets" covers land or any interests in land.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-001#26:1>
So, in countries like the United Kingdom and Australia, which levy
capital gains tax, any person who disposes of his real estate by sales,
exchanges of property or any other dealings is liable to pay tax on his
gains.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-001#27:1>
This is not so in Singapore.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-001#28:1>
If you sell your residence and make a huge gain you do not pay any
extra tax.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-001#29:1>
You keep all the profits.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-001#30:1>
A person is liable to pay tax on the profits on real estate
transactions only if the taxman considers that such profits are his income
and hence subject to taxation under the income tax law.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-001#31:1>
Estate agents and property investment companies earn their income by
making property deals and so are liable to pay income tax on their
commissions or profits.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-001#32:1>
The sale of property is their trade, occupation, profession or
business.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-001#33:1>
People who speculate in property, or those who buy and resell so
frequently that the taxman considers their activities amount to their trade,
occupation, profession or business, are required to pay income tax on the
profits made according to the income tax scale.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-001#34:1>
" Negative Gearing" - a Sound Investment Idea.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-001#35:1>
Investment in property can become a useful strategy for reducing your
tax bill.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-001#36:1>
It works like this: if you borrow money to purchase a property for
investment, and the rent or income generated by the property is not
sufficient to cover the loan and interest, and other outgoings, the money you
use to pay the loan and interest plus all expenses incurred for the
maintenance of the property can be used for tax deduction.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-001#37:1>
In other words, " gearing" means borrowing and when the cash flow is
negative ( more expenses than income), the situation is described as "
negatively geared".

<ICE-SIN:W2A-001#38:1>
You might ask why anyone would want an investment which costs him
money.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-001#39:1>
Property investment is a medium- or long-term investment, made by an
investor who is not concerned with immediate income.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-001#40:1>
He is usually more concerned with the capital gains of the property,
so that when he eventually sells his property, he will recoup all the
expenses incurred and at the same time reap a huge profit, free from capital
gains tax or income tax.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-001#41:1>
In other words, he holds on to the property longer in the hope of
bigger gains.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-001#42:1>
Exemption of estate duty for one unit of residential property.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-001#43:1>
Where a person dies, his estate has to pay estate duty to the
government calculated according to the value of the estate at the time of his
death.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-001#44:1>
The estate duty law however allows an exemption of estate duty for
one unit of residential property up to the extent of
&dollar;3 million, whether occupied by the deceased or not, and up to
&dollar;500,000 for any other property ( Section 14(3) estate Duty Act).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-001#45:1>
This is a favourable factor for investment in a residential property.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-001#46:1>
<h> Investing Your PF Savings in Real Estate. </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-001#47:1>
The law now allows all members of the Central Provident Fund Board to
use their CPF savings to repay housing loans, and to purchase property and
some authorized shares and stocks.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-001#48:1>
Take advantage of this law.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-001#49:1>
Invest your CPF savings in property.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-001#50:1>
A member who has used his CPF savings to purchase a property which he
subsequently resells at a profit, can keep all the profits after re-
crediting into his account the amount of CPF savings ( plus accrued interest)
which was withdrawn for the purchase.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-001#51:1>
But a member who has used his CPF savings to buy stocks and shares
which he later resells at a profit is obliged to recredit the entire sale
proceeds into his account.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-001#52:1>
This makes the use of CPF savings to purchase a property preferable
to its use for buying stocks and shares.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-001#53:1>
<h> Purchasing a House or Apartment. </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-001#54:1>
Location.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-001#55:1>
When a person purchases a house or apartment, he is actually putting
his savings into a property which will grow in value.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-001#56:1>
The purchasing power of money decreases with the passing of years
because of inflation and depression.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-001#57:1>
In choosing a property for investment, the golden rule is: "
Location, location, location".

<ICE-SIN:W2A-001#58:1>
Look for easy access to the central business district, proximity to
facilities such as the Mass Rapid Transit System, schools, markets,
department stores, and all those amenities which provide a person with the
comforts of life.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-001#59:1>
Avoid property which is in front of, or adjacent to, a graveyard.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-001#60:1>
You may not mind, but many other prospective buyers will, which may
make reselling the property more difficult for you.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-001#61:1>
Refrain from investing in a property at a junction.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-001#62:1>
Many local people consider this an unlucky location because it
offends the " nameless ones" ( ie the spirits) and so the property does not
usually have a high resale value.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-001#63:1>
Avoid property which is situated along a main road or noisy
thoroughfare, or property that is on the way to or from a congested traffic
area.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-001#64:1>
Be realistic rather than emotional when making a decision about
purchasing a property.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-001#65:1>
It is not like buying a bouquet of flowers which can be replaced from
time to time at low cost.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-001#66:1>
<h> The importance of good timing. </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-001#67:1>
The ideal course of action is to buy in gloom, and sell in boom.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-001#68:1>
But most of us are unable to predict times of gloom and boom.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-001#69:1>
The risks are there.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-001#70:1>
Within human limitation, the task is to match-make the timing of
investment with the development of the property market.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-001#71:1>
Success or failure in property investment depends on the timing which
is particularly critical when purchasing or development costs soar.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-001#72:1>
I have seen some developers lose heavily because of their poor
timing.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-001#73:1>
One example is when the land was acquired during a boom, and the
building of the houses was started just after the boom was over.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-001#74:1>
The houses were only ready for sale and occupation when the recession
was at its worst.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-001#75:1>
Villagers camped in the row of empty houses causing considerable
damage, and the developers had to pay for further repair costs in order to
try to sell them in a depressed market.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-001#76:1>
I have also seen other developers who were so fortunate in their
timing that their apartments sold so well that they even profited from their
levy of charges on a chain of subpurchasers of the same property each time
they asked for a fresh developer's contract.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-001#77:1>
From the experience of many property investors, it appears that
excessive caution can be as financially catastrophic as being optimism.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-001#78:1>
<h> Viewing a house or apartment. </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-001#79:1>
One must always view the property to be invested in.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-001#80:1>
One viewing is not enough.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-001#81:1>
Go back again and take a second look.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-001#82:1>
Drive around the area in which the property is situated at different
times of the day and at night.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-001#83:1>
See what kind of neighbours you are going to have.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-001#84:1>
Observe the environment.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-001#85:1>
Is there a rubber factory nearby which emits an unpleasant odour
every other day?

<ICE-SIN:W2A-001#86:1>
Check the direction of the setting sun in relation to your house -
will you be returning each evening to a home as warm as an oven?

<ICE-SIN:W2A-001#87:1>
Is there any noise pollution or disturbance from a nearby power
station?

<ICE-SIN:W2A-001#88:1>
Since this property is the place where you are going to live, make
sure that you and your family like it.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-001#89:1>
If you are accompanied by the vendor's agent, do not be too easily
persuaded by him into buying.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-001#90:1>
Do not be intimidated by his advances.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-001#91:1>
Hold your ground.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-001#92:1>
You owe him nothing.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-001#93:1>
Come back again without the agent before you decide to buy.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-001#94:1>
You should not then blame the agent if after the contract you regret
the decision.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-001#95:1>
By all means, listen to the agent but remember that he is there, at
his own expense, to tell you about the best features of the property in order
to get you to purchase it.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-001#96:1>
In so doing, he will earn his commission to cover his expenses and
cost of living.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-001#97:1>
He is not there to advise you not to buy the property because there
are defects in the house or other unpleasant factors.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-001#98:1>
He does not make his living that way.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-001#99:1>
You are the one who will buy the property, so you must decide.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-001#100:1>
Do not let the agent decide for you.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-001#101:1>
It is a good idea to engage a surveyor or valuer to advise you on
the state and condition of the property and on its value, before you enter
into a contract to purchase.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-001#102:1>
They are professional people competent to advise you.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-001#103:1>
They owe a duty of care in writing a valuation report, and can be
sued for negligence if the report is proven wrong.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-001#104:1>
A valuer's report will enable you to make the purchase with greater
peace of mind.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-001#105:1>
Sometimes market conditions can be such that a vendor will not wait
for you to make a decision after you have read a surveyor's or valuer's
report.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-001#106:1>
In a rapidly rising market, some vendors do not even consider
granting access to their property to an interested purchaser's surveyor or
valuer to enable him to write his report.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-001#107:1>
Their attitude can be blunt: take it or leave it.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-001#108:1>
No vendor likes hassles.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-001#109:1>
He will sell his property to the person offering the highest price,
and if he offers the price without a valuation report, it is not the vendor's
concern.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-001#110:1>
It is usually the case that, after contract, a valuation is prepared
by the surveyor or valuer of the bank or the Central Provident Fund Board
providing or releasing the finance for the purchase.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-001#111:1>
The bank or CPF Board relies on the valuer's report to determine the
amount to lend or the amount of CPF savings which may be withdrawn.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-001#112:1>
<h> Modify Your Lifestyle to Suit Your Means </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-001#113:1>
The dream of most young people is to own a semi-detached or
detached bungalow.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-001#114:1>
This dream, however, is out of reach for most young people new to
the workforce.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-001#115:1>
Rather than pouring rent money down the drain, it is recommended
that they buy something smaller such as a unit in a condominium, a townhouse
or a terrace house.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-001#116:1>
As long as they can get started, they stand a chance of owning
something bigger in the long run. <X>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-001#X117:1>
It is a matter of adjusting one's thinking to one's situation.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-001#X118:1>
If one over-commits himself, one can get into all sorts of
difficulties.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-001#X119:1>
Insufficient money has proven to be the root of many evils.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-001#X120:1>
Therefore, modify your lifestyle to suit your savings and buy an
affordable property.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-001#X121:1>
This will give you a foothold in the ever-spiralling property
market. </X> </I>
