<ICE-SIN:W2B-035#1:1>
<h> Pen-based organiser that boosts your IQ </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-035#2:1>
By Salma Khalik

<ICE-SIN:W2B-035#3:1>
Sharp has come out with a pocket hercules.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-035#4:1>
Its latest organiser, the IQ-9000, does almost everything you can
think of, plus a few more.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-035#5:1>
Organisers started as simple electronic diaries cum phone book and
memo pad.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-035#6:1>
The 9000 adds greater power and versatility.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-035#7:1>
One obvious improvement is the larger keyboard and screen.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-035#8:1>
The keypad on most organisers are fairly small and therefore difficult
for two-handed typing.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-035#9:1>
With the 9OOO many of the function keys have been moved to a touch
screen on the cover, freeing space for larger keys.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-035#10:1>
Its word processing is very much like that of a personal computer,
with fonts, underlining and indents.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-035#11:1>
Like earlier models, information can be printed or downloaded into a
PC.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-035#12:1>
A novel feature is the pen that comes with it.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-035#13:1>
My initial reaction: " a useless gimmick".

<ICE-SIN:W2B-035#14:1>
Was I wrong!

<ICE-SIN:W2B-035#15:1>
The pen allows you to write or draw stuff onto the scrapbook.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-035#16:1>
One of my reservations - how do you write neatly onto a screen?

<ICE-SIN:W2B-035#17:1>
- still stands.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-035#18:1>
Unless you are a calligrapher who can write with your hand in the
air, you'll need to rest your hand on the keyboard or edge of the organiser,
and that does not make for smooth writing.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-035#19:1>
But that should not be a concern.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-035#20:1>
The pen is an asset only when you need to jot something down fast,
and there is no paper around, without having to spend time opening the right
files.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-035#21:1>
The advantage with any organiser is the ability to carry so much
information, and space to write more, in a compact case that weighs just 430
grammes.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-035#22:1>
When you have the time later, you can transfer the information by
typing it into the section you want.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-035#23:1>
This can be easily done as the scrapbook can be shrunk to half its
size and some other file opened on the screen.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-035#24:1>
The pen also makes using the touch screen easier.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-035#25:1>
Sure you can use your fingers, but the soft point of the pen is more
accurate, especially when using the calculator.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-035#26:1>
Perhaps what I like most about the 9000 is its filing system that
cuts across all sections without taking up much of the available 125K memory.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-035#27:1>
No more frantic searches through schedules, memos and outlines to
find some piece of information I know I had put in but can't remember where.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-035#28:1>
The filing system lets you tag all material related to a particular
subject under one file.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-035#29:1>
There is also a search function, and again, it cuts across all
sections.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-035#30:1>
So if you had forgotten to tag a piece of information in your filing
system and do not know where you had put it, you can still find it easily and
transport the text to the right section without having to re-type it.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-035#31:1>
Another thing I like is the " To Do" function which comes in three
sections - things you need to do, things you have done, and your goals.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-035#32:1>
This complements the Daily Schedule section, and gives the
flexibility to put in things that need to be done, with no specific deadline.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-035#33:1>
You can prioritise the items, and easily change the priority if
something more important comes along.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-035#34:1>
It would have been better if we could arrange the To Do pages to suit
our individual needs.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-035#35:1>
As it is, one item has only one line of space.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-035#36:1>
Unlike Sharp's earlier organisers which use lithium batteries, this
uses four small alkaline batteries.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-035#37:1>
While this might mean lower cost, the batteries do not last very
long, especially if the organiser is used frequently.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-035#38:1>
At an hour a day, the manufacturers say it'll last two months
compared to the one year lifespan of the lithium.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-035#39:1>
Fortunately, an alert comes on when your batteries are running low,
and there is a Lithium back-up that only needs to be changed every five
years, so there is little danger of losing information.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-035#40:1>
The set automatically switches on if left unused for longer than 12
minutes.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-035#41:1>
This prevents batteries from running down due to user carelessness.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-035#42:1>
And while I'm asking for improvements, how about giving the cover
which holds the screen more than the two positions it can be opened at.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-035#43:1>
Right now, it either tilts slightly back from the perpendicular or at
a l80 degree angle.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-035#44:1>
Perhaps these are some things that can be addressed with the next
model.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-035#45:1>
Meanwhile, maybe I should trade my Sharp IQ-8200 in for this beauty.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-035#46:1>
<h> The new players </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-035#47:1>
by Yeong Ah Seng

<ICE-SIN:W2B-035#48:1>
FIRST, the compact disc ( CD), then the digital audio tape ( DAT) and
now the two much-vaunted digital audio products of the ' 90s - the digital
compact cassette ( DCC) and the Minidisc ( MD).

<ICE-SIN:W2B-035#49:1>
While the CD has virtually killed off the vinyl LP record, DAT has
flopped by comparison.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-035#50:1>
What fate awaits DCC and MD, the latest offerings in a crowded
consumer electronics market?

<ICE-SIN:W2B-035#51:1>
<h> Philips DCC900 </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-035#52:1>
THE DCC was first launched in Singapore some months back by Philips,
the originator of the format, which introduced a desktop model, the DCC900.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-035#53:1>
Portable DCC machines and dashboard models for the car are expected
later this year from Philips as well as licensees of DCC technology such as
Matsushita, Sanyo, Hitachi, Sharp and Pioneer.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-035#54:1>
Like the conventional compact cassette invented by Philips in 1963,
the DCC is a record and playback system for both pre-recorded and blank
tapes.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-035#55:1>
Digital signals are recorded on nine parallel tracks and there is no
need to flip the cassette which runs at the normal cassette speed.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-035#56:1>
DCC cassettes come in 45-, 60-, 75- and 90-minute formats.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-035#57:1>
The DCC boasts digital quality sound with none of the annoying hiss
prevalent in analogue cassettes.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-035#58:1>
And it offers backward compatibility, which means that users can play
their old cassettes on a DCC machine although recording is not possible.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-035#59:1>
The technical specifications are impressive and what one would expect
from a digital format.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-035#60:1>
Frequency response from 5 - 20,000 Hz, dynamic range of more than 105
dB and signal-to-noise ratio of 92 dB.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-035#61:1>
As with CD and DAT formats, the DCC offers direct track access.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-035#62:1>
Digital markers coded onto the tape when a recording is made make
this possible.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-035#63:1>
In addition, it displays text information such as album title, the
complete list of track titles and the names of the artiste on each track.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-035#64:1>
Future text information is likely to include lyrics which can be
displayed in synchronisation with the music.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-035#65:1>
Like DAT, the DCC comes with a Serial Copy Management System ( SCMS).

<ICE-SIN:W2B-035#66:1>
This means that a digital copy can be made from pre-recorded digital
material but only directly from the original material.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-035#67:1>
The recommended retail price of the DCC900 is
&dollar;1299. 

<ICE-SIN:W2B-035#68:1>
Pre-recorded and blank DCC tapes cost between
&dollar;20 and
&dollar;25. 

<ICE-SIN:W2B-035#69:1>
Sony MZ-l Minidisc

<ICE-SIN:W2B-035#70:1>
COMING hot on the heels of the DCC, Sony launched its recording MD
player MZ-l last month.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-035#71:1>
The 64-mm MD, considerably smaller than a CD, is encased in a plastic
shell like the 3.5 inch floppy disks used for computers.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-035#72:1>
It is a recordable optical disk.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-035#73:1>
The MD is half the size of a DCC tape.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-035#74:1>
And like the DCC, it can make digital copies via magneto-optical
recording on a blank MD and play back pre-recorded MDs.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-035#75:1>
The specifications are also similar: 5-20,000 Hz frequency
response; greater than 105 dB dynamic range and signal-to-noise ratio of 95
dB.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-035#76:1>
Owners of Discmans say one of the biggest problems in using portable
CD players is track skipping caused by vibration and shock.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-035#77:1>
The MD format addresses this problem by means of a 4-megabyte DRAM
memory which smooths out disruption caused by shock.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-035#78:1>
So even if there should be a break in data pickup from the disk
because of shock data read ahead and stored in memory effectively covers the
gap.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-035#79:1>
The MZ-1 offers quick track access and data on the track numbers and
titles of the individual tracks.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-035#80:1>
And when material is copied onto a blank MD, there is provision for
input of such information.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-035#81:1>
But despite the MD's small size, the MZ-1 is quite large compared
with CD Discmans.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-035#82:1>
It measures 114 x 43 x 139 mm and weighs 690 g.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-035#83:1>
The incorporation of a recording mechanism may be the reason for the
relative bulk.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-035#84:1>
Sony will shortly be releasing a play-back-only model, the MZ-2,
which should be not only smaller but also cheaper.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-035#85:1>
urrently, only blank MDs of 60-minute duration are available but a
74-minute blank MD is expected to be released soon.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-035#86:1>
This is important as a 60minute MD is not long enough for a complete
transfer from CD, especially for classical recordings.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-035#87:1>
The Sony MZ-1 retails for
&dollar;l,000, and pre-recorded and blank MDs cost between
&dollar;20 and
&dollar;25. 

<ICE-SIN:W2B-035#88:1>
Next week: DCC vs MD, which is better?

<ICE-SIN:W2B-035#89:1>
<h> DCC vs MiniDisc </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-035#90:1>
by Yeong Ah Seng

<ICE-SIN:W2B-035#91:1>
LAST week, this column featured two products, Sony's MiniDisc ( MD)
and Philips' Digital Compact Cassette ( DCC).

<ICE-SIN:W2B-035#92:1>
Today, a look at the
&dollar;64,000 question which many consumers or hi-fi enthusiasts are likely to ask:
Which is better, features and sound-wise, DCC or MD?

<ICE-SIN:W2B-035#93:1>
It should be noted at the outset that the Sony MD machine ( MZ-l)
used is a portable whereas the Philips DCC machine ( DCC900) is a desktop
model.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-035#94:1>
This means the DCC900 would have a leg up on the Sony in terms of
additional features and possibly sound quality.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-035#95:1>
It would have been a better comparison if a DCC portable was
available.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-035#96:1>
But this is not expected to be available until the middle of the
year.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-035#97:1>
Notwithstanding the slight mismatch, a comparison of the essential
features of DCC and MD, and what music recorded on the two formats sound like
yielded the following results ( see boxes).

<ICE-SIN:W2B-035#98:1>
SONY MZ-1

<ICE-SIN:W2B-035#99:1>
<h> Pluses: </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-035#100:1>
 Provision for input and display of track information including
artiste, song title and time.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-035#101:1>
 No skipping of tracks unlike portable CD Discmans.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-035#102:1>
The MZ-l is almost impervious to shock save for the hardest thump.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-035#103:1>
Great when one is on the run.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-035#104:1>
 The mini-disk is much smaller and compact compared to a DCC tape.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-035#105:1>
 Multiple over-writing of the recordable minidisc would not lead to
wear and tear unlike a DCC tape.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-035#106:1>
 Sound quality emphasises mid and high frequencies.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-035#107:1>
Very dynamic sound and ideal for pop music.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-035#108:1>
The MZ-1 also has a credible bass booster which can kick up quite a
beat.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-035#109:1>
Sound quality of playback from a CD transfer to MD is very close to
the CD original.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-035#110:1>
<h> Minuses: </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-035#111:1>
 The MDW-60 ( 60 minutes blank MD which is currently available is
not long enough to record longer pieces, especially classical music.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-035#112:1>
Until the longer MDW-74 ( 74 minutes) blank MD is available later
this year, users would have to put up with this inconvenience.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-035#113:1>
MDW-60 blanks cost
&dollar;19 each.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-035#114:1>
 MZ-1 is a heavier machine compared to current CD Discmans.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-035#115:1>
More miniaturisation is definitely needed.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-035#116:1>
 Unlike DCC, sound reproduction from the MZ-1 can be rather hard on
the ear over an extended period of listening.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-035#117:1>
This could be because the MZ-l, which is not really a hi-fi machine,
is aimed at the section of the market which favours portable boom boxes.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-035#118:1>
PHILIPS DCC900

<ICE-SIN:W2B-035#119:1>
Pluses

<ICE-SIN:W2B-035#120:1>
Comprehensive text information on tracks played; CD synchronisation
for easy transfer from a CD; clear track, time and recording mode displays;
and ease of editing.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-035#121:1>
Unlike analogue cassette recordings where one has to wind the tape
to a tapecounter setting determined by an educated guess, access to
individual tracks is quick.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-035#122:1>
DCC tape advances to the exact starting point of any track when a
button is pressed.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-035#123:1>
Similarly for rewind to previous tracks.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-035#124:1>
Sound quality of playback from pre-recorded DCCs is excellent.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-035#125:1>
Smooth, dynamic and definitely high-quality reproduction which is
easy on the ear.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-035#126:1>
Sound quality of playback from CD transfer to DCC is also good.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-035#127:1>
There is some very minor loss in the high frequencies but overall,
the reproduction is quite faithful to the original source.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-035#128:1>
Wide range of software available because of Philips' close
affiliation to Polygram, a major music software distributor.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-035#129:1>
DCC blanks cost:
&dollar;15 for 90 mins;
&dollar;13.50 for 75 mins;
&dollar;l2 for 60 mins; and
&dollar;11 for 45 mins. <X>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-035#X130:1>
Minuses:

<ICE-SIN:W2B-035#X131:1>
* Compared to MD, DCC track access is slow as it takes time to wind
the tape to a particular spot.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-035#X132:1>
 As with all tape devices, there is the likelihood of tape wear
over the long term.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-035#X133:1>
Digital Audio Tape ( DAT) suffers from this disadvantage as well.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-035#X134:1>
 DCC's backward compatibility feature, which allows analogue
cassettes to be played on DCC machines, can be a drawback.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-035#X135:1>
Some old analogue cassettes can be quite grotty or even
fungus-ridden.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-035#X136:1>
What that does to the DCC heads is unimaginable.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-035#X137:1>
 Sound quality from playback of analogue cassettes passable but
definitely not up to the standard of reproduction on a high-quality deck like
Nakamichi.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-035#X138:1>
OVERALL, I preferred the sound of the DCC.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-035#X139:1>
But in terms of size and portability, the MD comes out ahead. </X>
