their CSO2 is an A-level or first year University subject.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-008#8:1>

<ICE-SIN:W2D-008#9:1>

<ICE-SIN:W2D-008#70:2>
Each school will be given a few dates to select the day for the
screening.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-008#71:2>
The tests for glucose and blood cholesterol level would be more
accurate under fasting conditions i.e. without breakfast.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-008#72:2>
Once the dates are finalised, you will be informed accordingly so
that you can take the tests under fasting conditions.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-008#73:2>
The tests should however, be done with minimum disruption to lessons.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-008#74:2>
Officers who are absent on the day of screening will be provided
alternative dates for screening in schools within the same cluster.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-008#75:2>
3) The list of officers in each school and their personal particulars
necessary for the screening has been given to the service provider by MOE.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-008#76:2>
This list would be used as the Attendance List for the screening.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-008#77:2>
4) On completion of the screening exercise, please ensure that you
have initialed the Attendance List.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-008#78:2>
Payment to the service provider would be based on the certified
Attendance List.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-008#79:2>
5) Each officer will be provided with an individual health screening
report within two weeks of the screening.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-008#80:2>
6) Health education talks will be conducted by the service provider
for all interested officers on a cluster basis.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-008#81:2>
The venue for the talks will be arranged by MOE and would be in a
school within a cluster.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-008#82:2>
7) As part of the screening exercise, the service provider will also
conduct a lifestyle survey on all officers.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-008#83:2>
A summary of the findings will be included in the health education
talks.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-008#84:2>
8) For ease of communication the service provider will provide an
email address and a phone line for officers who wish to seek clarification on
the screening results.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-008#85:2>
9) Under the contract the service provider is not authorised to
advertise or promote any other services, drugs either directly or indirectly
to the staff before, during or after the screening exercise.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-008#86:2>
We are advised to report to MOE if the service provider does not
comply with this Requirement.
