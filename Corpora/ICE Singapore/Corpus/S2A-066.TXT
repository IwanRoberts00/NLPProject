<ICE-SIN:S2A-066#1:1:A>
My first point is in regard to the first and second accused's
ability to speak English

<ICE-SIN:S2A-066#2:1:A>
My submission basically is that your Honour have had the opportunity
of seeing the first and second accused in the witness box giving evidence and
reciting what they alleged were told by the police officers with ease and
with precision

<ICE-SIN:S2A-066#3:1:A>
Sentences such as you sign you say yes lah no sign see than man
hantam you you sign give you makan cigarette go back Bangladesh in that
precise order

<ICE-SIN:S2A-066#4:1:A>
They have not once mixed up the order and it is my submission that
these are hardly the actions of a person who doesn't speak English or who
doesn't have sufficient working knowledge of English

<ICE-SIN:S2A-066#5:1:A>
Your Honour have also got to bear in mind that the first accused had
spent about two years in Singapore and the second accused had spent about a
year and three months in Singapore

<ICE-SIN:S2A-066#6:1:A>
During that period they had contacts with locals and it is by their
own admission that they picked up local words like makan and hantam

<ICE-SIN:S2A-066#7:1:A>
The second accused even went to the extent of saying that he learned
a number of Malay words which he recited to this court

<ICE-SIN:S2A-066#8:1:A>
And it is my submission that through sheer necessity and through
exposure they had picked up more English words in Singapore than they had
learnt in Bangladesh

<ICE-SIN:S2A-066#9:1:A>
Your Honour have also had the opportunity to see that the two
accused are reasonably intelligent persons

<ICE-SIN:S2A-066#10:1:A>
Their geography of Singapore is also very good

<ICE-SIN:S2A-066#11:1:A>
During that period they picked up names of places in Singapore with
ease

<ICE-SIN:S2A-066#12:1:A>
That is hardly again my submission the action of people who were
illiterate in English

<ICE-SIN:S2A-066#13:1:A>
They would have had much difficulty in picking up these words had
they not had a working knowledge of English

<ICE-SIN:S2A-066#14:1:A>
My other point is that the two of them were also able to
communicate with Asmah binte Salim with whom they were acquainted

<ICE-SIN:S2A-066#15:1:A>
And the second accused had given an example of what he said to
Asmah on the twenty-first of January nineteen eighty-eight before he visited
her at her place at MacPherson

<ICE-SIN:S2A-066#16:1:A>
Coming to the assaults that the first accused alleged against the
police we first had his evidence that he was assaulted at Dunlop Street on
the thirty-first of January nineteen eighty-eight

<ICE-SIN:S2A-066#17:1:A>
Your Honours have heard evidence from the police officers who
denied that they ever assaulted the first accused at Dunlop Street

<ICE-SIN:S2A-066#18:1:A>
And when I cross-examined him his evidence was that there was a
crowd there

<ICE-SIN:S2A-066#19:1:A>
Is it reasonable for the police officers to assault a person whom
they were arresting in the presence of a crowd

<ICE-SIN:S2A-066#20:1:A>
I am asking your Honours to draw the inference that it is not
reasonable and never took place

<ICE-SIN:S2A-066#21:1:A>
We have the evidence of the police officers today that the first
accused only put up a mild resistance

<ICE-SIN:S2A-066#22:1:A>
Now in view of that was there any point in them to have assaulted
him in a public place

<ICE-SIN:S2A-066#23:1:A>
The evidence of the first accused is also at variance with the
evidence of the police officers

<ICE-SIN:S2A-066#24:1:A>
The first accused said he was pushed to a wall after having been
handcuffed

<ICE-SIN:S2A-066#25:1:A>
The police officers stated that he was never pushed against the
wall

<ICE-SIN:S2A-066#26:1:A>
His hands were placed on the bonnet of a car

<ICE-SIN:S2A-066#27:1:A>
Again why should the police officers lie on this point

<ICE-SIN:S2A-066#28:1:A>
We now come to the stage where the first accused was taken back to
the C I D after his arrest at Dunlop Street

<ICE-SIN:S2A-066#29:1:A>
His evidence is that he was assaulted by the police officers in the
detectives' office Koh Low and Quek

<ICE-SIN:S2A-066#30:1:A>
We have the evidence of Sergeant Quek that it was only he and
Corporal Koh who were guarding the accused in the detectives' office

<ICE-SIN:S2A-066#31:1:A>
Sergeant Koh was doing the questioning alone pending the arrival of
Inspector Yeoh

<ICE-SIN:S2A-066#32:1:A>
Again this is at variance with the first accused's evidence that he
was questioned by both Quek and Koh

<ICE-SIN:S2A-066#33:1:A>
I am asking your Honours to accept the evidence of Sergeant Quek
that Koh never interrogated or questioned the first accused and that no
assault ever took place in that room

<ICE-SIN:S2A-066#34:1:A>
When Inspector Yeoh arrived at the office at eight p m his evidence
is that he took the first accused into his office where he interviewed
briefly and the first accused told him that the second accused who was also
involved in the case was residing at Mandai

<ICE-SIN:S2A-066#35:1:A>
Now your Honours have heard the evidence of the police officers
that they had no difficulty in locating the house at Mandai

<ICE-SIN:S2A-066#36:1:A>
I am suggesting that if the first accused had merely uttered the
word Mandai and not specified the location to the Inspector they would have
great difficulty in locating the house

<ICE-SIN:S2A-066#37:1:A>
My argument is fortified by the fact that the Inspector has given
evidence alongside the evidence of Sergeant Quek that the first accused had
drawn a sketch-plan of the general locality of the house

<ICE-SIN:S2A-066#38:1:A>
We have heard evidence from the first accused that he has stayed
there for three or four days

<ICE-SIN:S2A-066#39:1:A>
Is it therefore unreasonable to suppose that they could have
produced such a sketch-plan <X>

<ICE-SIN:S2A-066#X40:1:A>
He of course denies it altogether </X>

<ICE-SIN:S2A-066#41:1:A>
He denies it altogether

<ICE-SIN:S2A-066#42:1:A>
Now as far as the medical examination forms are concerned your
Honours have already seen them in conjunction with the reports put up by the
doctors

<ICE-SIN:S2A-066#43:1:A>
The doctors' reports contain information that were not set out in
the medical examination forms

<ICE-SIN:S2A-066#44:1:A>
And it is my contention that it is only the accused themselves who
could have volunteered those information to the doctor

<ICE-SIN:S2A-066#45:1:A>
If it was my learned friend's contention that the doctor had
gleaned the information from the police officers then it would be
self-defeating because it would mean that the accused persons have told the
police officers which would in turn lead to the conclusion that they couldn't
have been ignorant of the English Language

<ICE-SIN:S2A-066#46:1:A>
And their evidence all along has been that they never spoke one
word to the police officers during the questioning for the reason that they
could not understand the officers

<ICE-SIN:S2A-066#47:1:A>
Coming to the recording of the first accused's statement in the
field diary which is Exhibit P fifty-three marked for identification

<ICE-SIN:S2A-066#48:1:A>
Your Honours have heard evidence from the Inspector that the first
accused gave him a statement at about ten thirty p m in English

<ICE-SIN:S2A-066#49:1:A>
Inspector has testified in court that the sentence construction in
that statement is his

<ICE-SIN:S2A-066#50:1:A>
He's not denying the fact but he maintains that the first accused
was able to communicate without difficulty in English with him

<ICE-SIN:S2A-066#51:1:A>
Now it's my submission that your Honour should accept the
Inspector's evidence in this respect because your Honour have seen the way
the first accused had given evidence in court and I submit that he was
conversant in English at the time he gave the field diary statement to the
Inspector

<ICE-SIN:S2A-066#52:1:A>
As far as the second accused's statement in the field diary is
concerned we have heard evidence from Inspector Yeoh that the second accused
even told him that he studied up to college level in Bangladesh and studied
English

<ICE-SIN:S2A-066#53:1:A>
And again it's my submission <X>

<ICE-SIN:S2A-066#X54:1:A>
It's not suggested that the Inspector has fabricated that </X>

<ICE-SIN:S2A-066#55:1:A>
No <X>

<ICE-SIN:S2A-066#X56:1:A>
So why are you objecting </X>

<ICE-SIN:S2A-066#57:1:A>
It must have come from the second accused and your Honour it brings
me to the point about which are the officers who brought the accused persons
into the Inspector's room

<ICE-SIN:S2A-066#58:1:A>
We've heard the first accused say that on every occasion it was Koh
and Low <X>

<ICE-SIN:S2A-066#X59:1:A>
Yes </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-066#60:1:A>
But your Honour would have also heard evidence from the police
officers with reference to their lock-up diary their pocket books or whatever
contemporaneous records that they had made that on different occasions it was
different officers who brought them into the room

<ICE-SIN:S2A-066#61:1:A>
And I submit that that piece of contradiction goes to show that the
accused person had fabricated all the evidence about the assaults that had
taken place prior to their being taken into

<ICE-SIN:S2A-066#62:1:A>
May it please your Honour <X>

<ICE-SIN:S2A-066#X63:1:A>
Yes </X>

<ICE-SIN:S2A-066#64:1:A>
I am much obliged to your Honour for allowing me to start late

<ICE-SIN:S2A-066#65:1:A>
Your Honour at the close of yesterday's proceedings I was asked by
your Honour to submit on section one hundred and twenty-one of the Criminal
Procedure Code

<ICE-SIN:S2A-066#66:1:A>
I have produced before you Sirs two cases which are relevant to
this point

<ICE-SIN:S2A-066#67:1:A>
But before I touch on those two cases perhaps we could look at the
wording of 121 again

<ICE-SIN:S2A-066#68:1:A>
Your Honour section one hundred and twenty-one point one merely
lays down the general principle that a police officer who is making an
investigation has the power to examine any person including the accused who
is supposed to be acquainted with all the facts and circumstances of the case
and that he has an obligation to record in writing what he has examined
orally

<ICE-SIN:S2A-066#69:1:A>
Sub-section two sets out the general principle that when a person
is examined by a police officer orally he has the obligation to state the
truth except that he may refuse to state any fact or circumstance which would
have a tendency to incriminate him

<ICE-SIN:S2A-066#70:1:A>
That is actually a principle against self-incrimination Section one
hundred and twenty-one does not say that the person has to be warned of this
particular provision of his right not to self-incriminate and this is borne
out by the two cases which I have produced before you

<ICE-SIN:S2A-066#71:1:A>
The first is Public Prosecutor against Chandran and two others

<ICE-SIN:S2A-066#72:1:A>
The report is contained in nineteen eighty-nine Clasnews number
three page eleven

<ICE-SIN:S2A-066#73:1:A>
Unfortunately it appears not to have been reported in the Malayan
Law Journal

<ICE-SIN:S2A-066#74:1:A>
Your Honour this is a case of three persons being charged with an
offence of murder committed in prosecution of a common object of an unlawful
assembly

<ICE-SIN:S2A-066#75:1:A>
And the relevant parts of the Judgment can be found on page
thirteen of the report

<ICE-SIN:S2A-066#76:1:A>
On page thirteen right-hand column under the heading Trial within a
trial the Judge said in that case however objections were strenuously raised
by Counsel for the three accused with regard to the statement which each of
them gave to the police subsequently in the course of police investigations
which are hereafter referred to as the section one hundred and twenty-one
statements

<ICE-SIN:S2A-066#77:1:A>
Accordingly a trial within a trial was held to determine the
admissibility of these statements

<ICE-SIN:S2A-066#78:1:A>
The section one hundred and twenty-one statement of the Second
Accused was taken first by Inspector Maniam of the Special Investigation
Section of the C I D over three days on seventh eighth and twenty-third of
May nineteen eighty-five

<ICE-SIN:S2A-066#79:1:A>
This statement was recorded in three parts

<ICE-SIN:S2A-066#80:1:A>
The third part has been detached because it relates to the personal
background of the Second Accused

<ICE-SIN:S2A-066#81:1:A>
The grounds of objection raised by the Second Accused on the first
two parts of the statement were

<ICE-SIN:S2A-066#82:1:A>
And the relevant ground is one a warning substantially in terms of
the provisions of section one hundred and twenty-one point two of the C P C
was not properly explained to the Second Accused before the commencement of
the statement on seventh of May

<ICE-SIN:S2A-066#83:1:A>
And the third ground is also relevant that the warning was not
administered to the Second Accused when the statement was continued on the
eighth of May

<ICE-SIN:S2A-066#84:1:A>
Turning over to the next page your Honour could you look at the
left-hand column second paragraph

<ICE-SIN:S2A-066#85:1:A>
Quite apart from this question whether or not the warning was
properly administered to the Second Accused there is the more general
question as to whether there is any requirement that the warning must be
administered to an accused before he gives his statement

<ICE-SIN:S2A-066#86:1:A>
We do not think there is anything in section one hundred and twenty
one that requires that this be done

<ICE-SIN:S2A-066#87:1:A>
Nor do we think that a failure to administer the warning to an
accused renders his statement taken down under section one hundred and twenty
one is inadmissible in evidence under section one hundred and twenty two
point five of the C P C </I>
