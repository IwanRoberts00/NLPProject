<h> Chapter Three: PROFILES OF SPECIES AT RISK </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-030#5:1>
This chapter highlights the plight of each of the fifty-two species
deemed to be presently in danger of extinction.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-030#6:1>
Each species account is accompanied by details of ( i) conservation (
ii) past and present range, ( iii) the threats to survival, ( iv) habitat, (
v) estimated current wild population [ A question mark ( ? ) next to a number
denotes a rough estimate, eg 50?], and ( vi) general comments illustrating
the main reasons for its decline, the conservation measures needs to be taken
and the overall outlook for the future.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-030#7:1>
ENGLISH NAME: GREAT-BILLED HERON ( 1).

<ICE-SIN:W2B-030#8:1>
SCIENTIFIC NAME: Ardea sumatrana.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-030#9:1>
SUBSPECIES: sumatrana ( Gibson-Hill 1950) FAMILY: ARDEIDAE.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-030#10:1>
STATUS: ENDANGERED.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-030#11:1>
DISTRIBUTION: Sentosa, St John's lsland, Lazarus lsland, P Tekukor,P
Bukom, P Sudong, P Salu, P Sakeng, P Hantu.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-030#12:1>
Sometimes visits the Pandan and Tuas coasts and recorded once ( 1976)
from Sg Loyang.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-030#13:1>
Formerly breeding but now absent from P Busing due to habitat
destruction.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-030#14:1>
HABITAT: mangrove, islets.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-030#15:1>
THREATS: HABITAT LOSS AND DISTURBANCE.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-030#16:1>
POPULATION: 20.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-030#17:1>
Measuring a massive 1.15 metres from bill tip to tail tip, the
Great-billed Heron is the tallest living bird in Singapore.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-030#18:1>
Clad in a sombre dusky grey plumage, it is a frequent sight, either
singly or in pairs, along the regular ferry ride to Kusu and St Johns
Islands, and at the coralarium on Sentosa.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-030#19:1>
Its future is however less certain.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-030#20:1>
Since this heron is only found in the southern islands, its continued
survival is dependent on their fate.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-030#21:1>
A large proportion of these have already been given to the building
of oil refining complexes and tourist resorts.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-030#22:1>
Other plans include the upgrading of the existing power station
facility on Pulau Tekukor and further land reclamation projects such as the
link-up of Pulau Sakeng and Semakau.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-030#23:1>
Only a few islands, for example, the live firing zone of Senang,
Pawai and Sudong, will be left as it is.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-030#24:1>
These changes to the southern islands could spell the end for the
magnificent Great-billed Heron.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-030#25:1>
There is therefore an urgent need to conduct a detailed survey of the
heron's present range, especially the little-explored islands of the Ayer
Chawan-Merlimau group and the inaccessible islands of Senang and Pawai.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-030#26:1>
Plenty should be put on the location of breeding sites and provisions
made for their protection.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-030#27:1>
NSS has organised numerous cruises to the southern islands in the
last few years.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-030#28:1>
Though far from comprehensive, they do give a picture of the existing
range and population of this bird and, more recently ( April 1990 and January
1991), confirmation of the presence of at least one breeding pair.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-030#29:1>
An appeal is currently being made to the authorities to conserve this
site.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-030#30:1>
ENGLISH NAME: GREY HERON ( 2).

<ICE-SIN:W2B-030#31:1>
SCENTIFIC NAME: Ardea cinerea.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-030#32:1>
SUBSPECES: rectirostris ( Gibson-Hill 1950).

<ICE-SIN:W2B-030#33:1>
FAMILY: ARDEIDAE.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-030#34:1>
STATUS: VULNERABLE.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-030#35:1>
DISTRIBUTION: Found throughout the northern coastline from Sungei
Buloh in the west to Pasir Ris in the east.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-030#36:1>
Also recorded along the West Coast and in the northern parts of the
Central Water Catchment area as well as the islands of Pulau Tekong and Pulau
Ubin.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-030#37:1>
HABITAT: marshes, ponds ( brackish and freshwater), reservoirs,
coasts and mangroves.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-030#38:1>
THREATS: LOSS OF NESTING SITE.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-030#39:1>
POPULATION: 250.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-030#40:1>
Although common throughout the northern and western coasts of
Singapore, the Grey Heron breeds only in the remnant mangroves and woodlands
of the Kranji River system.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-030#41:1>
They were about 70 pairs in this colony.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-030#42:1>
Unfortunately, disaster struck in October 1990 when work to clear the
nesting site, which happens to lie within an area designated for a new
transmission station for the Singapore Broadcasting Corporation, commenced.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-030#43:1>
Despite a public outcry, work, which was temporarily stopped to allow
28 eggs and 26 young abandoned by the breeding adults to be collected for
safekeeping by the Jurong Birdpark, continued and by January l991, the
destruction was complete.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-030#44:1>
In June 1991, 16 young birds were returned to their birthplace after
six months in captivity and three months of rehabilitation.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-030#45:1>
Another 11 are however destined to spend the remainder of their lives
in captivity.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-030#46:1>
Fears of local extinction in Singapore shortly after the complete
destruction of the original colony led to their close monitoring by concerned
NSS members and a complete picture of the reaction of the Kranji herons was
thus obtained ( H C Ho, pc).

<ICE-SIN:W2B-030#47:1>
After an initial three-month period when breeding birds hung around
the remnant colony in apparent confusion, a small colony was begun within 100
metres of the now-levelled original one.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-030#48:1>
This colony had 20 nests but was found abandoned in June 1991.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-030#49:1>
Another three colonies discovered since July 1991 in the same Kranji
River system had a total of 40 active nests and action is now being taken
with the authority ( Public Utilities Board) involved to conserve the active
colonies.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-030#50:1>
Further exploration of the Kranji River System is needed so that
existing heronries can be mapped and protected.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-030#51:1>
It is hoped that this crucial area can be preserved as a protected
area in view of its importance for resident water-birds, particularly the
Grey Heron.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-030#52:1>
ENGLISH NAME: BLACK-CROWNED NIGHT-HERON ( 3).

<ICE-SIN:W2B-030#53:1>
SCIENTIFIC NAME: Nycticorax nychcorax.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-030#54:1>
SUBSPECIES: nycticorax ( Gibson-Hill 1950.) FAMILY: ARDEIDAE.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-030#55:1>
STATUS: THREATENED.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-030#56:1>
DISTRIBUTION: Throughout the entire northern coastline; Central Water
Catchment reservoirs; Marina East and South; Jurong Lake; and the islands of
Pulau Teong and Pulau Ubin.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-030#57:1>
HABITAT: mangrove, ponds, marshes, reservoirs and coasts.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-030#58:1>
THREATS: DISTURBANCE OF NESTING SITE; PESTICIDE POISONING POPULATION:
300?

<ICE-SIN:W2B-030#59:1>
( formerly 1200).

<ICE-SIN:W2B-030#60:1>
Like the preceding species, the Black-crowned Night-heron is a common
and widespread species with only a single known nesting site.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-030#61:1>
This is located in a tiny one-hectare Rhizophora mangrove island
beside a Chinese temple at Sungei Khatib Bongsu.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-030#62:1>
An estimated 300-350 breeding pairs made their nests here together
with a small colony of Purple Herons.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-030#63:1>
A proposal by the NSS to preserve the site as a sanctuary for the
night-herons was accepted in principle by the government in late 1989.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-030#64:1>
The sanctuary is to come under the management or the Housing and
Development Board as part of the proposed Simpang New Town Project and the
future appeared secure for this species.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-030#65:1>
However, tragedy struck the 1,200-strong colony in July 1990 when
officials from the Ministry of Environment's Vector Control and Research
Division ( VCD) started fogging the mangrove island for an entire week and
once a week thereafter till October in response to complaints by residents of
a nearby housing estate of attacks by Culex sitrens mosquitoes.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-030#66:1>
Whether or not the mosquitoes actually came from the Khatib Bongsu
mangrove was not satisfactorily proven by the VCD.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-030#67:1>
The results of this intensive fogging operation were catastrophic.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-030#68:1>
According to the temple owners, the poisoned birds started dying
almost immediately and corpses of dead birds were present everywhere in the
vicinity of the heronry during the months of July and August.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-030#69:1>
Those that survived deserted their nests, leaving the eggs and
nestlings to die of starvation and exposure, or to the mercy of the
scavenging House Crows.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-030#70:1>
By late September, not a single bird could be found in the heronry;
the small colony of Purple Herons also vanished.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-030#71:1>
Alerted of the disaster by a letter written by a member of the public
to the press and by letters of appeal from the NSS to the various government
bodies, including the Ministry of Environment, the fogging operation was
finally stopped in October.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-030#72:1>
The first returning birds were seen in early November.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-030#73:1>
Unfortunately, these showed no interest in returning to nesting
activities but merely used the heronry as a roosting site.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-030#74:1>
Worse news followed.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-030#75:1>
There has been no signs of the night heron here since March 1991;
even the Purple heron has not returned to date.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-030#76:1>
Is it because the area is still heavily contaminated?

<ICE-SIN:W2B-030#77:1>
A detailed investigation, which should include the collection of
field samples, is needed to determine if the heronry is still "
chemically-unsafe".

<ICE-SIN:W2B-030#78:1>
Periodic field surveys are still being carried out at Khatib Bongsu
by the NSS to monitor the 'health" of the heronry in the hope that the night
herons will one day return.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-030#79:1>
Some of the " missing" night herons have since been discovered to be
nesting in Jurong Lake and though numbers are still very small ( circa 20
pairs) protection is now being sought for these birds.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-030#80:1>
Night herons are resilient birds.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-030#81:1>
Given the protection that they deserve, including the protection of
both nesting and feeding sites, they will be a continue to be a part of our
natural heritage, as they have for the last two or three decades at Khatib
Bongsu.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-030#82:1>
ENGLISH NAME: LESSER TREEDUCK ( 4).

<ICE-SIN:W2B-030#83:1>
SCENTIFIC NAME: Dendrocygna javanica.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-030#84:1>
SUBSPECES: None described.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-030#85:1>
FAMILY: ANATIDAE.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-030#86:1>
STATUS: VULNERABLE.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-030#87:1>
DISTRIBUTION: Senoko, Sungei Seletar Reservoir, Ponggol, Marina East,
Marina South, Pasir Ris, Poyan and Pulau Tekong.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-030#88:1>
Formerly Jurong, Simei, Ulu Sembawang and Seletar Reservoir.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-030#89:1>
Recently, Sg Buloh.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-030#90:1>
HABITAT: freshwater ponds and marshes.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-030#91:1>
THREATS: HABITAT LOSS AND DISTURBANCE; ILLECAL HUNTING/ TRAPPING.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-030#92:1>
POPULATION: 200.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-030#93:1>
The present rather scattered distribution of the Lesser Treeduck is
the result at a gradual loss of habitat to housing, industrial, urban and
roadworks projects in the last twenty years.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-030#94:1>
The phasing out of the old-style aqua-culture ponds has also
contributed to its decline as it avoids brackish wetland sites like Sungei
Buloh or Sungei Khatib Bongsu ( personal observation).

<ICE-SIN:W2B-030#95:1>
It is also absent from the central catchment reservoirs.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-030#96:1>
Though common and even abundant in certain areas, eg Manna South,
none of the sites listed above is protected and its continued survival is
therefore uncertain.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-030#97:1>
There is also the threat of illegal trapping and hunting.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-030#98:1>
Marina South, for example, is constantly plagued by poachers who use
nets to snare unwary ducks ( as well as other waterfowl in the area) while at
Senoko, " weekend sportsmen" have been observed shooting them for " sport".

<ICE-SIN:W2B-030#99:1>
Numbers have plunged from a peak of fifty in February 1990 to the
dozen now due to poaching and disturbance.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-030#100:1>
There is therefore a pressing need for such sites to be monitored
regularly for signs of poaching.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-030#101:1>
Another measure is for the increase of compound fines ( currently
S&dollar;1000) for those caught violating the Wild Animals and Birds Act ( 1972) to
act as a more effective deterrent.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-030#102:1>
Unless steps are taken to remove the twin threats of habitat loss
and poaching, these engaging birds, such as those which frolic in family
groups in the ponds at Marina South to the delight of passers-by everyday,
will soon become a thing of the past.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-030#103:1>
ENGLISH NAME: COTTON PYGMY GOOSE ( 5).

<ICE-SIN:W2B-030#104:1>
SCENTIFIC NAME: Nettapus coromandelianus.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-030#105:1>
SUBSPECES: coromandelianus ( Gibson-Hill 1950).

<ICE-SIN:W2B-030#106:1>
FAMILY: ANATIDAE.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-030#107:1>
STATUS: INDETERMINATE.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-030#108:1>
DISTRIBUTION: WEST COAST, KRANJI RESERVOIR.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-030#109:1>
HABITAT: FRESHWATER PONDS, MARSHES AND RESERVOIRS.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-030#110:1>
THREATS: UNVIABLE POPULATION LEVELS.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-030#111:1>
POPULATION: 20?.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-030#112:1>
As it is extremely localised in Singapore, the Cotton Pygmy Goose -
the world's smallest wildfowl - is highly at risk from extinction.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-030#113:1>
It is however classified as " indeterminate" in this study due to
doubts surrounding its status.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-030#114:1>
In South-east Asia, it is also assumed to be a resident as there is
no evidence to show that it migrates.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-030#115:1>
Conversely, there are also to date no records of this species
nesting anywhere within the region although it is present all year round (
Medway & Wells 1976; White & Bruce 1986; and Van Marle & Voous 1988).

<ICE-SIN:W2B-030#116:1>
Whatever its real status may be, the Cotton Pygmy Goose must
certainly qualify as " endangered" as it is only regularly recorded from one
site - Poyan - and the biggest flock ever counted numbers no more than
twenty.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-030#117:1>
It is only found in freshwater wetlands - a habitat which is in
short supply in Singapore.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-030#118:1>
A survey of all existing habitat is therefore needed to ( I) survey
sites for evidence of the presence of this bird and ( 2) assess population
sizes and importance of sites containing this species.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-030#119:1>
Areas with potential are the reservoirs of the Central Water
Catchment Area.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-030#120:1>
Kranji Reservoir ( where there's only been one record), Sungei
Seletar Reservoir and the largely unexplored Murai, Sarimbun and Tengah
Reservoirs of the Westem Water Catchment Area.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-030#121:1>
Barring a surprise find in the above-mentioned sites, it would
appear that Poyan holds Singapore's last surviving wild Cotton Pygmy Geese.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-030#122:1>
As such, they should be given total protection and closely
monitored. <X>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-030#X123:1>
Unfortunately, because Poyan is also part of the military
live-firing area, it is unlikely that it ( Poyan) will be preserved as a bird
sanctuary or that permission be granted to scientists to monitor the site on
a regular basis. </X> </I>
