Doctor Edmund Monterio has met counselled and treated almost
all ninty-nine people who have the aids virus in Singapore

<ICE-SIN:S2B-025#2:1:A>
He knows only too well the tragedy that aids brings

<ICE-SIN:S2B-025#3:1:A>
He's seen victims as young as twenty-one die from the disease struck
down even before their prime

<ICE-SIN:S2B-025#4:1:A>
For many the suffering wasn't only in death but also in the lonely
wait for it

<ICE-SIN:S2B-025#5:1:A>
What started out as silent HIV infection is know now full-bloom aids
for Richard

<ICE-SIN:S2B-025#6:1:A>
His family still doesn't know that his immune system has broken down
and now even a common cold can kill him

<ICE-SIN:S2B-025#7:1:A>
Like many other victims Richard thought it could never happen to him

<ICE-SIN:S2B-025#8:1:A>
Official Aids awareness programmes have been set in motion

<ICE-SIN:S2B-025#9:1:A>
But with relatively few people infected the disease seem far removed

<ICE-SIN:S2B-025#10:1:A>
This doesn't make aids any less real

<ICE-SIN:S2B-025#11:1:A>
One can carry the virus for years but not know it and with each
sexual encounter the deadly virus gets another chance to claim a new victim

<ICE-SIN:S2B-025#12:1:A>
It's also not unusual for victims to be unsure who they got the
disease from

<ICE-SIN:S2B-025#13:1:A>
This is the Thailand we are familiar with

<ICE-SIN:S2B-025#14:1:A>
But in this land of smiles aids has reached epidemic proportions

<ICE-SIN:S2B-025#15:1:A>
Eighteen year old Noi has been working here for just over a year

<ICE-SIN:S2B-025#16:1:A>
Her monthly test for HIV have so far been negative

<ICE-SIN:S2B-025#17:1:A>
But like thousands of other Thai prostitutes Noi has a seventy per
cent chance of getting aids and passing it on

<ICE-SIN:S2B-025#18:1:A>
From the estimated two to four hundred thousand Thais infected with
HIV virus the future is a hospital like this

<ICE-SIN:S2B-025#19:1:A>
Until two years ago twenty-two year old Suti spends most of his
night at Patpong one of Bangkok's famous night spots

<ICE-SIN:S2B-025#20:1:A>
In search of a better life he left home and family in impoverished
North-east Thailand

<ICE-SIN:S2B-025#21:1:A>
But a few years later he tested positive for HIV

<ICE-SIN:S2B-025#22:1:A>
He's been here since

<ICE-SIN:S2B-025#23:1:A>
Ten other young men share this ward with Suti

<ICE-SIN:S2B-025#24:1:A>
All are being treated for symptoms related to HIV infection

<ICE-SIN:S2B-025#25:1:A>
They do not yet have full-blown aids and are sent home when the
symptoms clear

<ICE-SIN:S2B-025#26:1:A>
Doctor Soomsin has seen over five hundred patients in the last four
years

<ICE-SIN:S2B-025#27:1:A>
Sixty have since died from the disease

<ICE-SIN:S2B-025#28:1:A>
Like elsewhere the victims are no longer just drug-users or
homosexuals

<ICE-SIN:S2B-025#29:1:A>
Aids has states its claim on heterosexuals here

<ICE-SIN:S2B-025#30:1:A>
The government estimates that by the year 2000 one in three deaths
in Thailand will be of Aids

<ICE-SIN:S2B-025#31:1:A>
This frightening spectre has raised much public concern and
Thailand has never done more to braised itself for the worse

<ICE-SIN:S2B-025#32:1:A>
One of the government's first steps was to approve the set-up of
this clinic

<ICE-SIN:S2B-025#33:1:A>
Believed to be Asia's first anonymous clinic it runs test for the
HIV virus

<ICE-SIN:S2B-025#34:1:A>
But such as the stigma of aids that for the clinic to be effective
it also promotes itself as a place to test for hepatitis B and syphilis

<ICE-SIN:S2B-025#35:1:A>
For those who come because of aids are counselled

<ICE-SIN:S2B-025#36:1:A>
They're also advised on safer sex and how to cope with the disease

<ICE-SIN:S2B-025#37:1:A>
The main drawing point is that the patient doesn't have to give his
name

<ICE-SIN:S2B-025#38:1:A>
To ensure that the test are kept confidential he's only known as a
number

<ICE-SIN:S2B-025#39:1:A>
Since the Thai Red Cross opened it five months ago this clinic has
seen about fifty people coming everyday

<ICE-SIN:S2B-025#40:1:A>
More are being planned as it's proven to be a turning point for
many

<ICE-SIN:S2B-025#41:1:A>
Despite this promising start and the efforts to maintain anonymity
it may take more to convince the thousands who need to be reached

<ICE-SIN:S2B-025#42:1:A>
These performers from a group called Empower bridges that gap

<ICE-SIN:S2B-025#43:1:A>
To break the ice humour is often used to give the message of aids
prevention across and it's aimed not just at bar-workers but also at their
patrons

<ICE-SIN:S2B-025#44:1:A>
The work of Empower however goes beyond these night performances

<ICE-SIN:S2B-025#45:1:A>
It also runs a drop in centre for the bar-workers

<ICE-SIN:S2B-025#46:1:A>
So when they're not practising for the next performance some girls
come here for counselling as well as English lessons

<ICE-SIN:S2B-025#47:1:A>
For those who had picked up the language English has been their
passport to better jobs as well as loads of self-confidence

<ICE-SIN:S2B-025#48:1:A>
And it's largely through efforts of people like Chantawepah Arpisok
that many bar-workers may just escape the clutches of aids

<ICE-SIN:S2B-025#49:1:A>
The director of Empower she started reaching out to the girls as
early as 1985

<ICE-SIN:S2B-025#50:1:A>
There are still quite a few places where Empower isn't welcome

<ICE-SIN:S2B-025#51:1:A>
But even if they're given the go ahead the message of safer sex
doesn't always go down well

<ICE-SIN:S2B-025#52:1:A>
One person who has been supporting Empower is twenty-three year old
Sudawan

<ICE-SIN:S2B-025#53:1:A>
She's a mamasan to the girls here at Rafifi in the Patpong district

<ICE-SIN:S2B-025#54:1:A>
But it's not always that neat

<ICE-SIN:S2B-025#55:1:A>
Some girls who refuse to appear on camera told us that condom or
not they must get more than four clients a month or have their salaries
deducted

<ICE-SIN:S2B-025#56:1:A>
And with business down from the aids scare the girls may not have
the luxury of being selective

<ICE-SIN:S2B-025#57:1:A>
There's another problem

<ICE-SIN:S2B-025#58:1:A>
Though the girls have never been more familiar with the safer sex
message they aren't always convince that it's necessary

<ICE-SIN:S2B-025#59:1:A>
Chiangmai known for its pristine scenery has also been scarred by
aids

<ICE-SIN:S2B-025#60:1:A>
More than five thousand HIV cases have so far been detected

<ICE-SIN:S2B-025#61:1:A>
But unlike Bangkok it's had better success in promoting condom
usage

<ICE-SIN:S2B-025#62:1:A>
Twenty-seven year old Lim has worked in this brothel for three
years

<ICE-SIN:S2B-025#63:1:A>
She was recently recruited by the health authorities to teach the
other girls about protecting themselves

<ICE-SIN:S2B-025#64:1:A>
Through Lim and others like her condom usage has been effectively
enforced

<ICE-SIN:S2B-025#65:1:A>
But it wasn't easy convincing the girls

<ICE-SIN:S2B-025#66:1:A>
This firm stand may just save Lim and many others

<ICE-SIN:S2B-025#67:1:A>
Wherever condom usage is enforced fewer new HIV cases have surfaced

<ICE-SIN:S2B-025#68:1:A>
But still one in eight prostitutes are believed to have the aids
virus

<ICE-SIN:S2B-025#69:1:A>
Those who have it continue working

<ICE-SIN:S2B-025#70:1:A>
Those who don't continue to be at risk

<ICE-SIN:S2B-025#71:1:A>
To stem the spread Thailand is determined to curb the vice trade
Minister Michye <unclear> word </unclear>

<ICE-SIN:S2B-025#72:1:A>
A bill now being considered by the Thai government aims to prevent
under-aged girls from going into prostitution

<ICE-SIN:S2B-025#73:1:A>
If passed severe action will also be taken against those who force
or trick girls into the trade

<ICE-SIN:S2B-025#74:1:A>
To deter more from being lured into prostitution for the money the
government has joint hands with private companies to adopt villages and offer
the women alternative employment

<ICE-SIN:S2B-025#75:1:A>
But curbing the vice trade is just part of Thailand's bigger fight
against aids

<ICE-SIN:S2B-025#76:1:A>
This is a village crematorium in Chiangmai

<ICE-SIN:S2B-025#77:1:A>
Some months ago relatives of one aids victim refuse to attend his
funeral

<ICE-SIN:S2B-025#78:1:A>
Fearing contaminated air the villages even stopped another
cremation from taking place

<ICE-SIN:S2B-025#79:1:A>
Frightening myths continue to surround the disease

<ICE-SIN:S2B-025#80:1:A>
The unwillingness to come to grips with it has also led to
ignorance which aids feed on

<ICE-SIN:S2B-025#81:1:A>
Many still think of aids as someone else's disease

<ICE-SIN:S2B-025#82:1:A>
This attitude is changing but slowly

<ICE-SIN:S2B-025#83:1:A>
The Chiangmai University Hospital is one of the major hospitals
involved in the treatment of aids but unlike the rest it made sure that the
aids patient is not isolated

<ICE-SIN:S2B-025#84:1:A>
So if he has a cold he'll be treated along with the others with the
same ailment

<ICE-SIN:S2B-025#85:1:A>
But the majority of Thais still feel that aids has nothing to do
with them

<ICE-SIN:S2B-025#86:1:A>
A recent survey showed that eighty-six per cent of Thai men
believed that there was very little chance of ever getting aids

<ICE-SIN:S2B-025#87:1:A>
Complacency is not only widespread in Thailand but also in
Singapore

<ICE-SIN:S2B-025#88:1:A>
Many continue in activities that puts them at risk

<ICE-SIN:S2B-025#89:1:A>
Of the ninety-nine identified cases here almost half are
heterosexuals

<ICE-SIN:S2B-025#90:1:A>
Many of them who contracted the virus claim they got it from
prostitutes here or overseas

<ICE-SIN:S2B-025#91:1:A>
But as in Thailand the prostitutes themselves face an even higher
risk

<ICE-SIN:S2B-025#92:1:A>
Despite this many who've come here do so for the same reason

<ICE-SIN:S2B-025#93:1:A>
But some may get more than they bargain

<ICE-SIN:S2B-025#94:1:A>
That's the reason why leaflets like these are handled out to them
during check-ups

<ICE-SIN:S2B-025#95:1:A>
Arranged by the anti-vice enforcement unit such checks have so far
found thirteen Thai prostitutes HIV positive

<ICE-SIN:S2B-025#96:1:A>
All have since been sent home

<ICE-SIN:S2B-025#97:1:A>
But because the aids virus can lie dormant and undetected for
months

<ICE-SIN:S2B-025#98:1:A>
These check-ups though regular could mislead the women and their
clients telling them that they're clean when actually not

<ICE-SIN:S2B-025#99:1:A>
The women themselves are aware of the need to practice safe sex but
often they have to give in to their customers

<ICE-SIN:S2B-025#100:1:A>
But it's a gamble even teenage prostitutes are willing to take

<ICE-SIN:S2B-025#101:1:A>
Detection of aids is even more difficult amongst them as they
operate independently

<ICE-SIN:S2B-025#102:1:A>
So far the aids virus has spared this group of Singaporeans

<ICE-SIN:S2B-025#103:1:A>
But it may just be a matter of time as surveys have shown that
teenagers are becoming more sexually active without taking the necessary
precautions against pregnancy venereal disease or aids

<ICE-SIN:S2B-025#104:1:A>
And with aids now spreading within the heterosexual community any
teenager or adult engaging in casual sex runs the risk of being infected

<ICE-SIN:S2B-025#105:1:A>
Places which hold the highest potential for sexual encounters may
well become areas where the aids virus next lurks

<ICE-SIN:S2B-025#106:1:A>
So one needn't step into the back main alleys of brothels to get
aids

<ICE-SIN:S2B-025#107:1:A>
The risk are of course higher but it's not confine to sexual
contacts with high risk groups like prostitutes

<ICE-SIN:S2B-025#108:1:A>
In fact it can now be transmitted within the home

<ICE-SIN:S2B-025#109:1:A>
This one year old Thai baby may not live beyond six months

<ICE-SIN:S2B-025#110:1:A>
She has the HIV virus

<ICE-SIN:S2B-025#111:1:A>
Abandoned at birth Euwan <unclear> word </unclear> was born to an
infected mother who caught the virus from her husband

<ICE-SIN:S2B-025#112:1:A>
Thailand is now facing the problem of aids babies

<ICE-SIN:S2B-025#113:1:A>
And so is Singapore

<ICE-SIN:S2B-025#114:1:A>
This is a TV ad warning the Thai public about aids

<ICE-SIN:S2B-025#115:1:A>
Singaporeans will soon see local versions

<ICE-SIN:S2B-025#116:1:A>
But the fight against the encroaching shadow of aids goes beyond
awareness

<ICE-SIN:S2B-025#117:1:A>
It is now a choice every individual has to make </I>

<ICE-SIN:S2B-025#118:2:B>
When the publicity agent of Cameron McKintosh Incorporated
offered me a free trip to New York to watch the actual Broadway production of
Les Miserables I told her please I have no time for all these

<ICE-SIN:S2B-025#119:2:B>
I'm very busy

<ICE-SIN:S2B-025#120:2:B>
Well I lied

<ICE-SIN:S2B-025#121:2:B>
Welcome to New York

<ICE-SIN:S2B-025#122:2:B>
I'll be watching the world's foremost musical Les Miserables

<ICE-SIN:S2B-025#123:2:B>
But not before in the sights and atmosphere that make up this
remarkable cosmopolitan city

<ICE-SIN:S2B-025#124:2:B>
Everything you've read and heard of New York is true but nothing
quite compares to actually being there to experience its people places and
culture

<ICE-SIN:S2B-025#125:2:B>
Walking down Broadway is an event in itself that removes any doubt
on New York being the creme de la creme of world class musical entertainment

<ICE-SIN:S2B-025#126:2:B>
And enthusiast the world over queue up daily at Times Square for
tickets to Broadway musicals as early as six months to a year in advance

<ICE-SIN:S2B-025#127:2:B>
Tickets for Les Miserables have been sold out for every
performance since its opening in nineteen eighty-seven

<ICE-SIN:S2B-025#128:2:B>
This score-boarded Time Square is a constant indication of the
number of people world-wide who's seen Les Mis to date

<ICE-SIN:S2B-025#129:2:B>
The late Alfred Hitchcock once said to a friend after reading
Victor Hugo's literary masterpiece Les Miserables that book will make a
wonderful musical

<ICE-SIN:S2B-025#130:2:B>
And he wasn't wrong

<ICE-SIN:S2B-025#131:2:B>
The Les Miserables recoup its four and a half million US
investments within twenty-three weeks of its opening

<ICE-SIN:S2B-025#132:2:B>
And with a production cost of over four million Les Mis
authentically pronounced Les Miserables is the empire state building of
musicals

<ICE-SIN:S2B-025#133:2:B>
Each production requires a crew of over one hundred

<ICE-SIN:S2B-025#134:2:B>
The cast include forty-two performers some of whom play as many as
twenty different characters

<ICE-SIN:S2B-025#135:2:B>
Four hundred costume changes are required involving more than one
thousand six hundred pieces of authentic nineteenth century costuming

<ICE-SIN:S2B-025#136:2:B>
Fifty wigs are used throughout the three and a quarter show all
handmade with human hair

<ICE-SIN:S2B-025#137:2:B>
And not to mention the extensive staging and use of sound lighting
electronic and electrical equipment

<ICE-SIN:S2B-025#138:2:B>
A seemingly unstable stage that can accommodate up to twenty
people

<ICE-SIN:S2B-025#139:2:B>
And a rotating stage floor ingeniously gives pace to the musical
that requires clockwork precision

<ICE-SIN:S2B-025#140:2:B>
But even the most talented of Broadway performers needs that
special guru to select and draw out that talents from within

<ICE-SIN:S2B-025#141:2:B>
An executive director of Cameron McKintosh Incorporated Richard
Jay Alexander has been that driving force since nineteen eighty-five <X>

<ICE-SIN:S2B-025#X142:2:B>
So what's the point of this story The point is I've just seen a
spectacular musical and the same cast including the director will be going
down to Singapore to perform for you next February So why come to Broadway
when Broadway will be right at your doorstep at the Kallang Theatre Miss Les
Miserables and be Les miserable Sponsored by DBS Bank and Singapore Airlines
Tickets will be available from all Sistic outlets from the twenty-first of
September </X> </I>
