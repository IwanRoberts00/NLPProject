<ICE-SIN:S2A-053#1:1:A>
Can you hear me <X>

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-053#X2:1:B>
Yes </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-053#3:1:A>
Alright I think we've lost some people here but no problem

<ICE-SIN:S2A-053#4:1:A>
It's their loss

<ICE-SIN:S2A-053#5:1:A>
Uhm today really I would like to spend the next couple of minutes
introducing to you Ami Pro the visual wordprocessor from Lotus

<ICE-SIN:S2A-053#6:1:A>
And I hope that after this you would be able to be challenged enough
to come aboard with package and really be able to create impacting visually
impacting docuhments to be able to communicate effectively maybe in your
organization here

<ICE-SIN:S2A-053#7:1:A>
Uhm in the event that if my voice starts to change or you know
things happen to my voice please excuse me because I've got a very bad cold
at the moment so please bear with me

<ICE-SIN:S2A-053#8:1:A>
Uhm I wanna assure you that the package is exciting so it's not so
trauhmatic to stay till you go for lunch alright

<ICE-SIN:S2A-053#9:1:A>
Okay so basically if I'll just sit here and I'll do the demo and
talk at the same time

<ICE-SIN:S2A-053#10:1:A>
You have seen 123 for Windows

<ICE-SIN:S2A-053#11:1:A>
Windows applications

<ICE-SIN:S2A-053#12:1:A>
Before we start how many of you are using just DOS wordprocessor as
opposed to Windows wordprocessor

<ICE-SIN:S2A-053#13:1:A>
Okay quite a nuhmber

<ICE-SIN:S2A-053#14:1:A>
So what I'll do is that uhm because Ami Pro is really power-packed
with features I can only I'll just show you some of these power-packed
features

<ICE-SIN:S2A-053#15:1:A>
But at the same time I will like to show you how easy it despite
its power how easy it is to use

<ICE-SIN:S2A-053#16:1:A>
Just like uhm just mentioned earlier that it's rated its
credibility is there as some of you who've updated to major industry

<ICE-SIN:S2A-053#17:1:A>
Journals

<ICE-SIN:S2A-053#18:1:A>
It's been consistently rated as very easy to use and yet powerful
wordprocessor

<ICE-SIN:S2A-053#19:1:A>
But it runs on Windows so basically I'll just show you a little bit

<ICE-SIN:S2A-053#20:1:A>
As you know the menus over here are typical of every Windows
applications

<ICE-SIN:S2A-053#21:1:A>
Pull-down menus you call it

<ICE-SIN:S2A-053#22:1:A>
But for this case you have under text

<ICE-SIN:S2A-053#23:1:A>
You have bold and maybe a keyboard command if you're not used to
the mouse which I'm using right now

<ICE-SIN:S2A-053#24:1:A>
So this is quite typical of Windows applications with its scroll
bar at the side here and also it's dynamic dated

<ICE-SIN:S2A-053#25:1:A>
Right at the bottom here where you get information path or even if
you don't have the time or watch has the time here

<ICE-SIN:S2A-053#26:1:A>
Now that's quite typical of wordprocessors

<ICE-SIN:S2A-053#27:1:A>
The difference here you see is this Smart icon which Dave brought
out earlier

<ICE-SIN:S2A-053#28:1:A>
Smart icons

<ICE-SIN:S2A-053#29:1:A>
Some people call it templates

<ICE-SIN:S2A-053#30:1:A>
I call it short-cut keyboard uh or short-cut commands

<ICE-SIN:S2A-053#31:1:A>
And over here it's typical of all Lotus applications in that you
see whatever you see here like printer or even right at the bottom here bold
italic it's the same picture that you see in 123 for Windows and Freelance
for Windows and that is a plus point because the benefit's obvious

<ICE-SIN:S2A-053#32:1:A>
You'll be so familiar with these icons when you go into 123 or
Freelance

<ICE-SIN:S2A-053#33:1:A>
It's just a touch of your it's a click of your mouse alright

<ICE-SIN:S2A-053#34:1:A>
I I wanna emphasize also like for here this icon over here where I
would like to customize my

<ICE-SIN:S2A-053#35:1:A>
I can move into tools customer micro user's setup for Smart icons

<ICE-SIN:S2A-053#36:1:A>
Well I'll just click here for customization

<ICE-SIN:S2A-053#37:1:A>
Over here as you know I have a standard icons that depicts you can
see the description

<ICE-SIN:S2A-053#38:1:A>
Here I use this to show the power-packed features of Ami Pro
capitalized ruler thesaurus spell checker bookmarks etcetera etcetera

<ICE-SIN:S2A-053#39:1:A>
I'll demonstrate some of these features later on

<ICE-SIN:S2A-053#40:1:A>
There are altogether one hundred short cut keyboards for you to use

<ICE-SIN:S2A-053#41:1:A>
So it depends

<ICE-SIN:S2A-053#42:1:A>
It allows for flexibility

<ICE-SIN:S2A-053#43:1:A>
If you are familiar with let's say you use spell checker all the
time you wanna carry just pick it up and drag and put it into your current
palate

<ICE-SIN:S2A-053#44:1:A>
You don't want it pick it up and drag it back alright

<ICE-SIN:S2A-053#45:1:A>
And if this is not sufficient if these hundred icons are not
sufficient you can actually customize your icons by using the <unclear> word
</unclear> drawing package that Ami Pro supplies with or other packages

<ICE-SIN:S2A-053#46:1:A>
So it's fine and I'll say I'll just move into it and like what uhm
we've mentioned I won't touch on it top left bottom or floating

<ICE-SIN:S2A-053#47:1:A>
I'll keep it as top

<ICE-SIN:S2A-053#48:1:A>
Okay so the screen here that now I'm going straight into the screen
or your workspace you call it the views that we have for Ami Pro

<ICE-SIN:S2A-053#49:1:A>
Right now we're at the working view

<ICE-SIN:S2A-053#50:1:A>
Just click here

<ICE-SIN:S2A-053#51:1:A>
We have full page standard enlarged and facing page

<ICE-SIN:S2A-053#52:1:A>
When I mention just now about visual wordprocessor I will explain
the benefits where we could actually when we go into full page mode here you
can actually do complete editing here if you required

<ICE-SIN:S2A-053#53:1:A>
As you can see unlike some Windows applications that you know that
they just go into preview and you can't touch it and you need to print

<ICE-SIN:S2A-053#54:1:A>
Over here you can actually format it as it looks on a full page

<ICE-SIN:S2A-053#55:1:A>
That's the advantage and that's true wysiwig or true visual
wordprocessor

<ICE-SIN:S2A-053#56:1:A>
So that's why we position Ami Pro as a visual wordprocessor because
what you see here is exactly what you print with no catch involved

<ICE-SIN:S2A-053#57:1:A>
So if you are familiar with let's go back here

<ICE-SIN:S2A-053#58:1:A>
Uhm one of the key difference you notice here also is that if you
are doing the traditional DOS wordprocessor everything is just blank and a
lot of guesswork involved

<ICE-SIN:S2A-053#59:1:A>
So over here you actually see whatever it is including the whole
page here

<ICE-SIN:S2A-053#60:1:A>
The green sign here is actually the header and at the bottom over
here it's right at the bottom will be the footer which you can also key in
directly alright

<ICE-SIN:S2A-053#61:1:A>
Let me go through the process of showing how it is easy is to
create let's say a new docuhment

<ICE-SIN:S2A-053#62:1:A>
So you go File New

<ICE-SIN:S2A-053#63:1:A>
Ami Pro actually has predesigned fifty five templates or style
sheets we call it

<ICE-SIN:S2A-053#64:1:A>
Style sheets are actually templates that allows you it
automatically formats for you your text and your docuhment

<ICE-SIN:S2A-053#65:1:A>
So you might wanna choose maybe uh facts style sheet your contents
or invoice or letter style sheet or memos

<ICE-SIN:S2A-053#66:1:A>
The different memos here and even newsletters

<ICE-SIN:S2A-053#67:1:A>
Later on I'll show you some of the style sheets which are used for
different docuhments

<ICE-SIN:S2A-053#68:1:A>
So it's definitely quick and easy for you to get on board File New
and choose the style sheet you're familiar with and just go on

<ICE-SIN:S2A-053#69:1:A>
So for example here maybe I'll choose a fact style sheet

<ICE-SIN:S2A-053#70:1:A>
I'll replace current file

<ICE-SIN:S2A-053#71:1:A>
I don't know want I don't wanna save

<ICE-SIN:S2A-053#72:1:A>
This dialog box here in the user's setup

<ICE-SIN:S2A-053#73:1:A>
I've set it each time for to prompt me whether I wanna save or not

<ICE-SIN:S2A-053#74:1:A>
Well you can go into the user's setup and actually have an auto
save so that you will not lose your file in case of any power uh you know off
or things like that

<ICE-SIN:S2A-053#75:1:A>
So what it does is now it load up a template and I've picked with
contents

<ICE-SIN:S2A-053#76:1:A>
So what it does is it actually gives you the templates that is
within a frame and all you need to do is go in there and then start typing in
alright

<ICE-SIN:S2A-053#77:1:A>
This is just an example of a template or a a style sheet

<ICE-SIN:S2A-053#78:1:A>
I don't want that

<ICE-SIN:S2A-053#79:1:A>
I prefer something which I've customized just for this demo and
I've named it lynn memo style which means if you don't want a pre-designed
style sheet you can just use your own style sheet that are customized earlier
and I say okay

<ICE-SIN:S2A-053#80:1:A>
What it does now is that it've brought out a style sheet here and
I've actually created a macro

<ICE-SIN:S2A-053#81:1:A>
If some of you are familiar with macros and like to play around
with it Ami Pro has a very powerful set and it's easy to use macro

<ICE-SIN:S2A-053#82:1:A>
I've actually put in a macro so that straightaway in a power field
it brings up the dialog box that asks me who do I want to type this to

<ICE-SIN:S2A-053#83:1:A>
This is a my memo and I'll like to type it to let's say my boss
which is uh Casey Leman

<ICE-SIN:S2A-053#84:1:A>
Sorry I've spelt wrongly alright and I say okay

<ICE-SIN:S2A-053#85:1:A>
And it's straightaway the macro goes into next power field bit
<unclear> word </unclear> ask me sub subject then right now I'm talking about
the Annual report

<ICE-SIN:S2A-053#86:1:A>
Something and let's go down a little bit here so you notice over
here this style sheet happens to have macros that enhances me

<ICE-SIN:S2A-053#87:1:A>
I don't have to click here to type but if you don't have a macro
you can easily just click here and type Casey Leman

<ICE-SIN:S2A-053#88:1:A>
Click here and type whatever

<ICE-SIN:S2A-053#89:1:A>
If you notice over here at the bottom here there is this style
sheet paragraph styles you call it

<ICE-SIN:S2A-053#90:1:A>
Each style sheet or each docuhment style you see will be
accompanied with an assortment of paragraph styles which you can choose from

<ICE-SIN:S2A-053#91:1:A>
Body text or title header footer and this is predesigned with
together the style sheets

<ICE-SIN:S2A-053#92:1:A>
Great <unclear> word </unclear>

<ICE-SIN:S2A-053#93:1:A>
I'll show you later you can actually add in your own paragraph
styles and it's very easy

<ICE-SIN:S2A-053#94:1:A>
So right now when I click over here you notice that it changed to
regarding if I click over here it's to from <unclear> word </unclear>

<ICE-SIN:S2A-053#95:1:A>
So the cursor movement okay I move this one <unclear> word
</unclear>

<ICE-SIN:S2A-053#96:1:A>
Cursor's missing

<ICE-SIN:S2A-053#97:1:A>
Uhm I'll like to apologize here because I've loaded a new mouse
driver and it seems to be missing at this point of time

<ICE-SIN:S2A-053#98:1:A>
So must have been loaded up here

<ICE-SIN:S2A-053#99:1:A>
Okay no problem <unclear> word </unclear>

<ICE-SIN:S2A-053#100:1:A>
Okay

<ICE-SIN:S2A-053#101:1:A>
No the cursor the mouse is there

<ICE-SIN:S2A-053#102:1:A>
Okay no problem

<ICE-SIN:S2A-053#103:1:A>
I'm loading up Ami Pro again

<ICE-SIN:S2A-053#104:1:A>
Guess I was a bit enthusiastic

<ICE-SIN:S2A-053#105:1:A>
I took it a new mouse driver

<ICE-SIN:S2A-053#106:1:A>
You notice when it moves around it changes its size and uh I could
have installed it wrongly

<ICE-SIN:S2A-053#107:1:A>
Okay it's loading up right now

<ICE-SIN:S2A-053#108:1:A>
I'm using a 386 <unclear> word </unclear> machine right now on a
lap laptop thirty-three megahertz and okay the cursors go here but File New
let me go into it

<ICE-SIN:S2A-053#109:1:A>
Bear with me for a while and I'll go in again to my lynn okay

<ICE-SIN:S2A-053#110:1:A>
This style sheet that's calling up like I mentioned its has macros

<ICE-SIN:S2A-053#111:1:A>
So you go in again to Casey Leman so I'll just <unclear> word
</unclear>

<ICE-SIN:S2A-053#112:1:A>
Alright

<ICE-SIN:S2A-053#113:1:A>
And over here <unclear> word </unclear>

<ICE-SIN:S2A-053#114:1:A>
Alright my cursor is now there

<ICE-SIN:S2A-053#115:1:A>
Okay this I've just touched this Ami Pro switch kit here

<ICE-SIN:S2A-053#116:1:A>
I'll talk about it a little later on

<ICE-SIN:S2A-053#117:1:A>
Something which a little enhancements which I've loaded up

<ICE-SIN:S2A-053#118:1:A>
Okay so basically you notice when I click my cursor here it's
under Regarding

<ICE-SIN:S2A-053#119:1:A>
If I click here automatically it tells you at the bottom here what
it what paragraph style it is

<ICE-SIN:S2A-053#120:1:A>
So if I enter here automatically you remember this paragraph
setting but I can easily change it by clicking here to body text alright

<ICE-SIN:S2A-053#121:1:A>
And as my typing is really slow what I'll do is I'm bringing some
text under the paragraph format of body text and I put a macro here and it
types in for me so that you guys won't fall asleep

<ICE-SIN:S2A-053#122:1:A>
So body text changed now I will like to have bullet and instead of
typing again I'm really slow so I do a macro here which invokes typing which
I've done earlier before this memo

<ICE-SIN:S2A-053#123:1:A>
And what I'll do is that uh bullet I'll go back to my text and
draw a <unclear> word </unclear>

<ICE-SIN:S2A-053#124:1:A>
So basically you can see that my docuhment is complete but I'll
like to maybe make some changes to formatting

<ICE-SIN:S2A-053#125:1:A>
So what I'll do is that I can easily click into this maybe I need
an indent here I'll click over here

<ICE-SIN:S2A-053#126:1:A>
You can see there's a ruler here and once I click on it the tab
ruler comes out

<ICE-SIN:S2A-053#127:1:A>
So maybe I wanna hang in indent <unclear> word </unclear>

<ICE-SIN:S2A-053#128:1:A>
Right now and I push it

<ICE-SIN:S2A-053#129:1:A>
Here you notice that you just fall through

<ICE-SIN:S2A-053#130:1:A>
Or if the tab ruler here over here I didn't make use of any tab
but you can adjust and pull across the tab and you can see how easily or
maybe you just throw it away <X>

<ICE-SIN:S2A-053#X131:1:A>
Or if you wanna to do it you can put it back on again So this is
what you call direct screen formatting or page formatting which is one of the
enhancements of visual wordprocessor So the ruler here if you could on and
off For me I'll like it on because I like to make use of it So again let's
take a look how it looks in full page </X> </I>
