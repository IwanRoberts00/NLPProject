<h> Chapter One </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#2:1>
On a grey, miserable December afternoon, a man and his wife alighted
from a taxi in Clemenceau Avenue.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#3:1>
The man carried two tattered nylon suitcases.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#4:1>
He was thin, narrow-shouldered and not more than 1.73 metres tall.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#5:1>
His face was bony and lean-jawed.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#6:1>
Heavy black eyebrows met in a V over a high-bridged fleshy nose that
had obviously been battered many times before.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#7:1>
His eyes were guarded and his lips, strange in such a hard face, were
as red and as shapely as a woman's.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#8:1>
The blue shirt he had on was frayed at the collar and stained a dirty
brown with sweat.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#9:1>
The trousers hung loose.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#10:1>
The man did not look happy.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#11:1>
The girl was pretty and young.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#12:1>
She had taken great care with her make-up.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#13:1>
Black kohl smudged her eyes and made them bigger than they already
were.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#14:1>
Pink blusher swept her high cheek-bones and her lips gleamed with
rosy gloss.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#15:1>
A gold choker glimmered on her fair neck and gold anklets both
ankles.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#16:1>
She was almost as tall as the man, and very slim.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#17:1>
But she moved slowly, almost languorously, as though carrying a
secret weight.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#18:1>
The man leaned protectively towards her.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#19:1>
They had been married only a month.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#20:1>
His name was Shahid Hussain Soomro.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#21:1>
He was 35-years-old but looked at least ten years older.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#22:1>
His wife was known as Saminah, and she was 22.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#23:1>
They were both from Pakistan.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#24:1>
The time was 4 pm and the day, December 17, 1990, a Monday eight days
before Christmas.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#25:1>
Just a stone's throw away, Orchard Road was teeming with frazzled
shoppers trying to beat the Christmas deadline.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#26:1>
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles were the rage that year and on every
child's Christmas list.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#27:1>
Much to the delight of store managers, parents were fast clearing the
shelves of those monstrous green plastic half-man-half-turtle toys.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#28:1>
Cash registers were merrily ringing in the festive season.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#29:1>
There was much less activity in Clemenceau Avenue, a narrow, winding
stretch of road named after M Georges Clemenceau, the French premier during
World War One, who visited Singapore in the 1920s.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#30:1>
Only a handful of cars were cruising past at that time of day, the
rush-hour traffic jams being an hour or so away.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#31:1>
A yellow-and-black taxi stuck close to the kerb, waiting to pick up
passengers.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#32:1>
There were none around.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#33:1>
The couple stood in front of a block of private apartments called Sky
Villa.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#34:1>
It was an incongruously glamourous name.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#35:1>
The facade of the building was squat, sleepy and ugly.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#36:1>
Laundry hung untidily from the back balconies of the white and blue
flats, and an assortment of brooms, mops and featherdusters were displayed
for all to see.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#37:1>
Sky Villa was also considerably dwarfed by the svelte
concrete-and-glass structures that had sprung up around it in recent years.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#38:1>
The Pakistanis collected their breath.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#39:1>
They had done a lot of walking that day and their feet were aching.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#40:1>
With a sigh, Shahid heaved up the bags and they headed for the
apartments.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#41:1>
They took a stuffy lift to the third floor.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#42:1>
They had been advised to try their luck there.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#43:1>
A room might just be available.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#44:1>
Yusof Mon, a stocky 68-year-old Malay caretaker with the thick
shoulders and careless gait of a seaman, was reading the newspaper when he
heard the knock on his door.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#45:1>
He opened it and peered at the couple through blue-rimmed
cataract-stricken eyes.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#46:1>
Foreigners, he saw at once.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#47:1>
Down-and-out too.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#48:1>
The man was shabbily dressed.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#49:1>
His face was drawn and bleak.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#50:1>
The girl, he noted, had dark crescents under her eyes despite her
thick make-up.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#51:1>
" Hello, got room here?" Shahid's English was heavily-accented.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#52:1>
He spoke hesitantly, as if he didn't dare place too much hope on the
question and dreaded the answer.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#53:1>
" Yes." Yusof Mon watched over three furnished apartments.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#54:1>
They were free of boarders at the moment.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#55:1>
" How much?

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#56:1>
We come from Pakistan.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#57:1>
We don't have much money.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#58:1>
We go to hotel, but too expensive".

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#59:1>
Shahid's words came out in a rush and his face looked hopeful.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#60:1>
" Forty dollars one day," Yusof Mon replied.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#61:1>
He could see that they were exhausted.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#62:1>
The man, especially, looked like he could lie down anywhere, for
week.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#63:1>
Shahid screwed his eyes and appeared to make some mental
calculations.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#64:1>
Then he nodded.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#65:1>
" Okay.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#66:1>
We take it.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#67:1>
We stay a few days".

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#68:1>
The caretaker led them across the hall to an empty apartment.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#69:1>
The couple was shown into a small dismal bedroom.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#70:1>
It was sparsely furnished - just a single bed and a wardrobe.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#71:1>
A coat of dust covered the bare concrete floor and the curtain hung
limply at the window.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#72:1>
It had once been white, but was now a dirty shade of grey.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#73:1>
The Pakistanis didn't seem to notice their less than salubrious
surroundings.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#74:1>
They were just relieved at finally finding a room.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#75:1>
Yusof Mon left them and went back to his newspaper.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#76:1>
Thin slats of weak sunlight wavered through the window sills.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#77:1>
The murmur of cleaning women gossiping below the apartment drifted up
to the room.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#78:1>
Far off there were the creaks and groans of machines working on
Singapore's first underground road tunnel in the Central Expressway.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#79:1>
The sounds reminded Shahid of the screech of wild birds - beady-eyed
ravens, or vultures encircling their prey.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#80:1>
Saminah unpacked.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#81:1>
They had left in a hurry and had brought little with them.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#82:1>
The clothes in the suitcases belonged mostly to her - colourful
Punjabi suits in the brightest shades of orange, green, red and purple.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#83:1>
Shahid sat on the bed and smoked.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#84:1>
The mattress was thin and hard.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#85:1>
He watched the specks of dust floating aimlessly in the sunlight.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#86:1>
His head throbbed and there was a nagging pain on the right side of
his abdomen.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#87:1>
He was glad at finding a place for the night.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#88:1>
The rent was too high, but they needed only to stay until he found
something cheaper.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#89:1>
He didn't expect Singapore to be so expensive.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#90:1>
He was shocked at the prices the hotels were asking.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#91:1>
This room was small, but at least the old caretaker didn't ask too
many questions.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#92:1>
He took out another cigarette and lighted it slowly with a match.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#93:1>
The past few months had been bad, running from place to place and
always looking behind to make sure that no one was following him.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#94:1>
He was exhausted.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#95:1>
He wanted nothing but sleep.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#96:1>
But he knew that with sleep came his nightmares, such terror-crazed
dreams with their ugly images of death and killing that left him paralysed
with fear and totally disoriented when he awoke.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#97:1>
His hands grew clammy at the thought.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#98:1>
He started to sweat.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#99:1>
Shahid concentrated his mind with effort: He and Saminah would stay
in Singapore for a few days while everything was being arranged.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#100:1>
Then they would go to Australia.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#101:1>
Those people would look at his application.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#102:1>
His chances were fair.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#103:1>
Sydney was the most likely city he could start over.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#104:1>
The idea of a new life with his young wife lightened his mood.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#105:1>
He looked at Saminah.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#106:1>
Her curly shoulder-length hair shone and she was humming a tune as
she unpacked.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#107:1>
She didn't look in the least worried about their situation.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#108:1>
In fact, she kept telling him how glad she was to be in Singapore.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#109:1>
She trusted him and looked up to him and that made him feel good.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#110:1>
Shahid relaxed.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#111:1>
His frown looked less severe.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#112:1>
He reassured himself one more time: his nightmares would disappear
in Australia, and his past would be just that - a thing of the past.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#113:1>
No one would come after him.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#114:1>
He would not be hanged after all.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#115:1>
<h> Chapter Two </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#116:1>
In his years as a caretaker, Yusof Mon had made friends with many of
the tourists who rented the rooms he kept watch over.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#117:1>
Most of them were hippy-like European travellers on a shoestring
budget who couldn't afford the rates hotels charged, but wanted a place in
the city.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#118:1>
The old man had fond memories of these cheerful young people, and
kept photographs of himself posing with them in his wallet.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#119:1>
He took out the pictures whenever he was bored or lonely, and often
wondered how they were doing back home.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#120:1>
But he sensed that the Pakistani couple was different from the other
tourists.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#121:1>
Shahid tried to make conversation once or twice.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#122:1>
But the Pakistani seemed too withdrawn for someone on a holiday.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#123:1>
He hardly smiled, let alone laughed.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#124:1>
He had a preoccupied look on his face, as if something was troubling
him.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#125:1>
Saminah also kept to herself, and didn't even go shopping like most
female tourists.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#126:1>
So it was no loss to the caretaker when, three days later, on
December 20, the couple moved out of the apartment after paying the rent.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#127:1>
Yusof Mon went about his business.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#128:1>
He checked the rooms, read the newspaper and, within a day, had
forgotten about the strange Pakistani and his young wife.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#129:1>
On the morning of December 24, the old man went back to his own home
in Jalan Teck Whye to spend the Christmas holiday with his family.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#130:1>
He was pottering about in his singlet when, at noon, he heard the
doorbell ring.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#131:1>
" Please, can you help us?

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#132:1>
We have no money, we have no place to go.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#133:1>
Can we stay with you for a while?" Shahid was at the door with
Saminah.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#134:1>
Their two travelling bags were on the floor.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#135:1>
Thye looked grubby and weary.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#136:1>
The girl's make-up was smudged.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#137:1>
She had been crying.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#138:1>
Yusof Mon was shocked.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#139:1>
For a moment, he couldn't even place them.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#140:1>
When he finally realised who they were, he wondered: How did they
know where he lived?

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#141:1>
Did he give Shahid his address?

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#142:1>
Well, yes, maybe he did during one of their short conversations.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#143:1>
But never did he think the man would remember it, let alone seek him
out and ask for help.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#144:1>
" How can I help?

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#145:1>
I have no money, I have no room.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#146:1>
I cannot do anything for you".

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#147:1>
The old man knew he was being hard-hearted.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#148:1>
But what else could he do, he told himself.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#149:1>
He couldn't just let strangers into his house, even if he had room
for them to stay.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#150:1>
He had read many newspaper stories about how people got robbed and
even killed for being too trusting.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#151:1>
Shahid pleaded.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#152:1>
He was only temporarily out of money, he said, and would soon
receive a large sum from Pakistan.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#153:1>
His family members were important people with political connections
and they would help him.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#154:1>
He needed shelter for just one week.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#155:1>
Then he was going to Australia.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#156:1>
He could not afford the
&dollar;40 he paid for the Sky Villa room.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#157:1>
He had tried so many other places.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#158:1>
He was only turning to the old man as a last measure.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#159:1>
Yusof Mon was the only person he knew in Singapore.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#160:1>
Everyone else were strangers.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#161:1>
" Please help a fellow Muslim," he begged.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#162:1>
And, he revealed, Saminah was pregnant.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#163:1>
The girl sniffed when her name was mentioned and looked as if she
was going to start crying.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#164:1>
Shahid was a smooth talker.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#165:1>
Yusof Mon yielded.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#166:1>
" I have no room here," he repeated.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#167:1>
" But maybe my daughter can help you.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#168:1>
Come in first".

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#169:1>
The couple stepped inside gratefully.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#170:1>
Surani binte Yilsof, 31, was at her flat in Bukit Panjang when her
father called.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#171:1>
" Two fellas here from Pakistan got problem.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#172:1>
Money problem and wife also pregnant.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#173:1>
They say want to borrow one room.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#174:1>
They say want to stay here with me.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#175:1>
How can?

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#176:1>
You want to lend your room?" he asked.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#177:1>
" I'll go there now," Surani said immediately.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#178:1>
A plump, pleasant-faced mother of two boys, she was a practical sort
of person who did not believe in procrastination.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#179:1>
It was better to sweep away problems as they came, she always
thought.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#180:1>
her husband, Salim, sold satay at a stall in Telok Blangah, but it
was she who made all his business decisions.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#181:1>
When she arrived, the Pakistanis were seated in the hall.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#182:1>
Two glasses of 7-Up and a plate of butter cake were on the table in
front of them.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#183:1>
The couple looked shy, even ill at ease. <X>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#X184:1>
Surani was an optimist and liked to see the best in things.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-005#X185:1>
Shahid, she concluded at once, had a decent face. </X> </I>
