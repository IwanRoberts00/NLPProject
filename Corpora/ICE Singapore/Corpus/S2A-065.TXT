<ICE-SIN:S2A-065#1:1:A>
There are two short points really in this appeal which are
plainly on the Evidence Act but before I take your Lordships into the middle
of that I ought to give your Lordships a slight or a fair amount of the
background of this case

<ICE-SIN:S2A-065#2:1:A>
The claim itself is for the alleged sale of about six hundred and
forty thousand shares at three dollars and fifty-six cents in a limited
company

<ICE-SIN:S2A-065#3:1:A>
The completion date for that according to the claim was September of
nineteen eighty-three

<ICE-SIN:S2A-065#4:1:A>
The consideration for the delay until completion was that the
Defendant the Appellant in this case would service an overdraft account at
fee of the Respondents' banks

<ICE-SIN:S2A-065#5:1:A>
This went on to September eighty-four well past completion date when
for reasons which I will come to in a moment interest on the overdraft
account stopped

<ICE-SIN:S2A-065#6:1:A>
In December eighty-four the Plaintiff Respondent sold out and
there was a shortfall of approximately one and a half million dollars

<ICE-SIN:S2A-065#7:1:A>
Some time soon after that two sums of twenty thousand and thirty
thousand were paid by the or were paid to the Plaintiff my Lord

<ICE-SIN:S2A-065#8:1:A>
Now that is the claim

<ICE-SIN:S2A-065#9:1:A>
The defence there are two parts to the defence your Honours

<ICE-SIN:S2A-065#10:1:A>
The first one is that the Defendant applied to strike out the claim
against him on the ground that he was not the defendant or the person who is
alleged to be the person who purchased the shares

<ICE-SIN:S2A-065#11:1:A>
That's been adjourned sine die

<ICE-SIN:S2A-065#12:1:A>
The other was based on an Order fourteen application for summary
judgment and that came before the learned Registrar for hearing on a number
of occasions and basically this is what the Defendant's claim is

<ICE-SIN:S2A-065#13:1:A>
The shares were sold

<ICE-SIN:S2A-065#14:1:A>
It was an oral sale there's nothing in writing

<ICE-SIN:S2A-065#15:1:A>
The Defendant says or rather the defence is that Khoo I call him
for short Khoo the broker says it was a sale to one Gosali

<ICE-SIN:S2A-065#16:1:A>
It wasn't a sale but an option to purchase the option to last for
twenty-four months

<ICE-SIN:S2A-065#17:1:A>
Meantime it was to service the overdraft account

<ICE-SIN:S2A-065#18:1:A>
Gosali an Indonesian filed an affidavit confirming this and that he
was the buyer

<ICE-SIN:S2A-065#19:1:A>
And then we come to this point your Honour where there was a series
of discussions when this fifty thousand dollars in two sums were paid

<ICE-SIN:S2A-065#20:1:A>
Now Mister Gosali put in his account or part of his account to show
that in fact he had paid this interest and your Honour will perhaps look at
page one hundred and twenty-eight of the record where he lists out the
various payments he made through a firm associated with the Defendant

<ICE-SIN:S2A-065#21:1:A>
Now this is where the link has come in my Lord that's at page one
hundred and twenty-nine of the record

<ICE-SIN:S2A-065#22:1:A>
I bring this out my Lord because this startling point must have
shaken the Plaintiff's claim because this is a certified account my Lord
showing the interest payments and they go back a number of years my Lord or
over a certain period

<ICE-SIN:S2A-065#23:1:A>
Now this is all filed in the summary proceedings and the issue that
came up immediately after that when affidavits were filed my Lord on two
matters which are set out in the which I will come to in a moment which were
set out in the affidavits of the parties

<ICE-SIN:S2A-065#24:1:A>
Now the first the complaint your Honour are really at page one
hundred and nine where you will find my Lord that Mister Gosali or Mister
Khoo says and I ought to go through this now my Lord because this is where
the crux of this case is at page one hundred and nine of the record at the
second paragraph there my Lord

<ICE-SIN:S2A-065#25:1:A>
I approached Mister Gosali with the information given to me by the
Plaintiff and asked him if he was interested in acquiring the Plaintiff's
shares on the terms mentioned and after some discussion relating to the
information given by the Plaintiff he agreed to take up the option

<ICE-SIN:S2A-065#26:1:A>
By October eighty-four the shares had dropped heavily in value and
it was discovered that the representations or information given by the
Plaintiff was false or inaccurate

<ICE-SIN:S2A-065#27:1:A>
Mister Gosali then began to have different views regarding the
exercise of the option and after negotiations on behalf of Mister Gosali and
the Plaintiff the option was cancelled

<ICE-SIN:S2A-065#28:1:A>
Now this is Mister Khoo's statement your Honour and Mister Gosali
just the same and supports this statement my Lord

<ICE-SIN:S2A-065#29:1:A>
Now immediately after that the Plaintiff filed in an affidavit at
page one hundred and thirty-four as to the rest of the said affidavit and the
affidavit of Erwan Gosali

<ICE-SIN:S2A-065#30:1:A>
I crave leave to refer to my affidavit of eighteenth February
nineteen eighty-six

<ICE-SIN:S2A-065#31:1:A>
I do not know who Erwan Gosali is and have never heard of him

<ICE-SIN:S2A-065#32:1:A>
I crave leave to refer to paragraph ten of the affidavit of Erwan
Gosali the negotiations were carried out between the Defendant himself and on
his behalf by John Khoo with Mister Subhas Anandan and were on the methods of
payment of the shortfall represented by the agreed price of two million two
hundred and seventy-eight thousand and four hundred less the total proceeds
of six hundred and ninety six thousand and seventy-nine from the sale of S P
P Limited shares in the market

<ICE-SIN:S2A-065#33:1:A>
One of the proposals put forth by the Defendant to Mister Subhas
Anandan to pay the shortfall of one million five hundred and eighty-two
thousand and two hundred and thirty-one plus the outstanding interest was by
way of transfer of three units of housing at One Tree Hill Gardens being
developed by T K Lim Realty Limited Defendant's company

<ICE-SIN:S2A-065#34:1:A>
Annexed hereto is the copy of the telex from John Khoo to Subhas
Anandan a copy of telex marked G from Mister Subhas Anandan to the said John
Khoo and a copy of a letter from John Khoo to Mister Subhas Anandan marked H
giving specifications and built-up areas of the units offered by the
Defendant

<ICE-SIN:S2A-065#35:1:A>
The proposal was aborted as the development was encumbered and no
satisfactory proposal to life the encumbrances came from the Defendant

<ICE-SIN:S2A-065#36:1:A>
Now my Lords that's the first reply to Gosali and to Mister Khoo

<ICE-SIN:S2A-065#37:1:A>
Now Mister Khoo then filed some affidavits it's at page one hundred
and sixty-four at the bottom of the page my Lord

<ICE-SIN:S2A-065#38:1:A>
As regards paragraph eleven of the said affidavit I deny that there
was any representation made by me on behalf of the Defendant to Mister Subhas
Anandan who was acting for me in the without prejudice negotiations regarding
the balance of the overdraft interest and not the alleged shortfall claim
against the Defendant

<ICE-SIN:S2A-065#39:1:A>
Mister Subhas Anandan had certain bias or interest in the property
referred to therein and had requested more particulars thereof

<ICE-SIN:S2A-065#40:1:A>
Can I read that again my Lord

<ICE-SIN:S2A-065#41:1:A>
As regards paragraph eleven of the affidavit I deny there was any
representation made by me on behalf of Defendant to Mister Subhas Anandan who
was acting for me in the without prejudice negotiations

<ICE-SIN:S2A-065#42:1:A>
The emphasis my Lord at that point of time this is without
prejudice

<ICE-SIN:S2A-065#43:1:A>
This was also taken at a point of time immediately after the
Plaintiff put in his affidavit

<ICE-SIN:S2A-065#44:1:A>
Now my Lord after that Mister Chew goes straightaway and files an
affidavit at page one hundred and seventy-one where he lists out the various
proposals and goes deeper into the negotiations my Lord

<ICE-SIN:S2A-065#45:1:A>
As to paragraph nine that's page one hundred and seventy-one as to
paragraph nine of the affidavit annexed hereto and marked C G four it's a
draft prepared by Mister Subhas Anandan which incorporated one of the
proposals made by the Defendant for securing payment of the amount claimed by
the Plaintiff by the issue of shares to the Plaintiff by Alitier Private
Limited which shares were to be paid for by capitalisation of the Defendant's
loans to his own family company

<ICE-SIN:S2A-065#46:1:A>
The proposal set out in so and so fell through and Defendant
offered to transfer three units of housing in the One Tree Hill Garden

<ICE-SIN:S2A-065#47:1:A>
For this purpose I had the valuation of the units made annexed here
is a copy letter to Mister Subhas Anandan dated twenty-fifth January
eighty-five enclosing the valuation

<ICE-SIN:S2A-065#48:1:A>
The price of the units to be transferred to the Plaintiff was to be
the payment of the amount due to the Plaintiff

<ICE-SIN:S2A-065#49:1:A>
As the price of the three units pegged at two hundred and eighty
dollars per square foot exceeded the amount of the Plaintiff's claim the
Plaintiff eventually agreed to take two units and the balance of his claim to
be paid by the Defendant in cash

<ICE-SIN:S2A-065#50:1:A>
I then instructed Messengers Goh Poh and Partners to help in
drafting the agreement for this proposal

<ICE-SIN:S2A-065#51:1:A>
I have heard that searches showed that the property was encumbered
to the limit of five million

<ICE-SIN:S2A-065#52:1:A>
Annexed hereto is a copy of the company's search on Alitier Private
Limited showing the charges registered against the company and a copy of
certificate of title showing the circumstances marked C R T seven

<ICE-SIN:S2A-065#53:1:A>
Goh Poh and Partners then wrote to Messenger Subhas Anandan on
twenty-ninth July as per annexed so and so my Lord

<ICE-SIN:S2A-065#54:1:A>
Now the learned judge hearing the appeal from the Registrar said
that the door had been opened the initial statement made by Gazali and Khoo

<ICE-SIN:S2A-065#55:1:A>
I haven't read Gazali's one but I will now

<ICE-SIN:S2A-065#56:1:A>
Now I'll go back again to Mister Khoo first because it's important
to know whether the door in fact had been opened

<ICE-SIN:S2A-065#57:1:A>
It's at paragraph fifteen let me read it again my Lord

<ICE-SIN:S2A-065#58:1:A>
Mister Gazali then began to have different views regarding the
exercise of the option and after negotiations on behalf of Mister Gazali and
the Plaintiff the option was cancelled

<ICE-SIN:S2A-065#59:1:A>
Now Gazali says your Honour at page one hundred and twenty-eight my
Lord

<ICE-SIN:S2A-065#60:1:A>
I missed that paragraph ten my Lord of his affidavit Gazali's
affidavit after a series of discussions between the Plaintiff and my
intermediaries it was agreed in early December nineteen eighty-four I could
abandon the option provided I paid interest in the sum of fifty thousand
payable in two installments

<ICE-SIN:S2A-065#61:1:A>
I duly paid the same

<ICE-SIN:S2A-065#62:1:A>
Now this is what is supposed to have opened the door to the
negotiations because from then on Mister Khoo promptly pulls the door wide
open and brings in various points that were raised and which are in the
without prejudice negotiations which Mister Khoo properly said and gave
notice in his affidavit these are without prejudice

<ICE-SIN:S2A-065#63:1:A>
Now of course the other side or rather the judge has held well you
shouldn't have put in all these other facts if you say it's without prejudice
why did you not just stop there and just say these are without prejudice

<ICE-SIN:S2A-065#64:1:A>
It should be either struck out or removed from the record

<ICE-SIN:S2A-065#65:1:A>
My Lord I have an authority to this effect my Lord that you are
entitled to state your case in the event that you do not be allowed to treat
these statements or documents as being in fact without prejudice

<ICE-SIN:S2A-065#66:1:A>
The simple reason is a lot of people mark their letters or their
statements without prejudice when there is no dispute and no negotiations as
such in the sense that there is a pending court case

<ICE-SIN:S2A-065#67:1:A>
And then they call it without prejudice you see it very often my
Lords

<ICE-SIN:S2A-065#68:1:A>
I'm sure your Lordships in your long careers must have seen this
being used very freely

<ICE-SIN:S2A-065#69:1:A>
It means nothing unless there is a dispute that's going to court
the words without prejudice mean absolutely nothing make no effect

<ICE-SIN:S2A-065#70:1:A>
They have no effect at all my Lord

<ICE-SIN:S2A-065#71:1:A>
You can say without waiving my rights and that doesn't prevent it
becoming admissible

<ICE-SIN:S2A-065#72:1:A>
Now the last affidavit was done on the thirteenth of May my Lord
and on the twentieth that's three days after the application to strike out
was made my Lord

<ICE-SIN:S2A-065#73:1:A>
Now the two grounds that were given by the learned judge who heard
the view or appeal was one that only the parties to the negotiations have
this privilege no third party is entitled to it <X>

<ICE-SIN:S2A-065#X74:1:A>
Now may I just point out my Lord, and I've got it in the skeleton
at page 3 my Lord </X> </I>
