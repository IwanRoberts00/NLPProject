In AM Singapore today President Bush intends to send planes to
Iraq

<ICE-SIN:S1B-042#2:1:A>
We ask if he's over-reacting and more varied ECA programs for our
schools

<ICE-SIN:S1B-042#3:1:A>
What do the principals think all these and more in the next twenty
minutes

<ICE-SIN:S1B-042#4:1:A>
Hello I'm Shanji Dabaracharji

<ICE-SIN:S1B-042#5:1:A>
Disbelief outrage and anger that's how Iraq has reacted to the news
that President Bush had authorised US military forces to escort United
Nations' team inspecting Iraqi weapon sites

<ICE-SIN:S1B-042#6:1:A>
The forces are now on alert ready to be sent if Iraq shows no
flexibility over conditions over which UN teams can be allowed to inspect the
sites

<ICE-SIN:S1B-042#7:1:A>
The American leader however has said that he did not expect action
to be necessary against Iraq

<ICE-SIN:S1B-042#8:1:A>
The announcement came amid confusion about whether the United States
had definitely decided to send additional air forces to Saudi Arabia

<ICE-SIN:S1B-042#9:1:A>
President Bush had said that the aircraft could be used to provide
cover for UN inspection teams searching for weapons of mass destruction

<ICE-SIN:S1B-042#10:1:A>
However as no one had expected the Iraqis to hand details of their
security forces over on on a silver platter

<ICE-SIN:S1B-042#11:1:A>
Did President Bush then exhaust all possibilities or were there
other options he overlooked

<ICE-SIN:S1B-042#14:1:B>
Well according to the UN secretary General the Iraqis had been
showing some signs of flexibility and only last week they had backed down
over the use of their helicopters

<ICE-SIN:S1B-042#15:1:B>
Do you think that perhaps President Bush has over-reacted <X>

<ICE-SIN:S1B-042#17:1:B>
The UN inspection team that has been in Iraq has discovered
that Iraq's weapon capability is at a much higher stage than anyone expected

<ICE-SIN:S1B-042#18:1:B>
Do you think that this this discovery has influenced America's
decision to some extent <X>

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-042#20:1:B>
Well the Iraqis have been rather creative in hiding their
military equipment even if force was to be used

<ICE-SIN:S1B-042#21:1:B>
Do you think that Iraq can be stripped of its military potential

<$A>

And from the possibility of fighting Iraq team once again to a
country split by a long-running violence in Yugoslavia the warring factions
appears to have ignored the cease-fire which came into effect at six o'clock
yesterday

<ICE-SIN:S1B-042#24:1:A>
In fact fighting is reported in many areas

<ICE-SIN:S1B-042#25:1:A>
The broker of this present cease-fire former British foreign
secretary Lord Carrington has asked for twenty-four hours before writing off
this attempt

<ICE-SIN:S1B-042#26:1:A>
Adrian Ong asks professor Adney Berlonski on whether they should
write up the cease-fire or whether they should give time as Lord Carrington
suggested <X>

Croatia's Defence Minister has just resigned today uh
presumably because there are some differences in lieu

<ICE-SIN:S1B-042#29:1:B>
Do you see a split in <unclear> word </unclear> over how they
should deal with the Serbians <X>

Professor Adney Bolongski on the line from London

<ICE-SIN:S1B-042#39:1:A>
And the time now is seven twenty-three

<ICE-SIN:S1B-042#40:1:A>
Coming up next here in AM Singapore investing in Germany

<ICE-SIN:S1B-042#41:1:A>
To encourage investment in the five eastern states of Germany the
German government is providing a high level of financial support while the
federal government gives incentives through taxation and the price of real
estate

<ICE-SIN:S1B-042#42:1:A>
Local governments provide support through local structures and
facilities

<ICE-SIN:S1B-042#43:1:A>
This same support is given to all investors both domestic and
foreign but wouldn't this put German companies at an advantage given that
they speak the same language and share a similar culture

<ICE-SIN:S1B-042#44:1:A>
Doctor Henning Forsherald president of the <unclear> word
</unclear> or the other house of parliament agrees but he gives but he gives
Christina Eng the reasons for doing so <X>

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-042#46:1:C>
Well we have had uhm previous calls for investment in East
Germany but so far no single Singaporean investment has been made what do you
think is hold Singapore investors back <X>

<ICE-SIN:S1B-042#X47:1:C>

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-042#48:1:C>
Well you're trying to promote uh German investment in the
eastern states but you're also trying trying to promote German investment in
the Asian pacific why <X>

Next on AM Singapore ECA programs for our schools

<ICE-SIN:S1B-042#52:1:A>
Four hundred principals gathered at the ECA seminar yesterday to
examine the policies and future directions for extra-curricular activities in
Singapore schools

<ICE-SIN:S1B-042#53:1:A>
They hope to develop a rich and varied ECA program that will add
colour to school life and help students build character and achieve personal
growth

<ICE-SIN:S1B-042#54:1:A>
Dr Tay Eng Soon Senior Minister of State for Education was the
Guest at honour at the seminar yesterday

<ICE-SIN:S1B-042#55:1:A>
Karen Won asked him wouldn't that wouldn't putting more emphasis on
ECA be adding pressure on the child

<$D> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-042#56:1:D>
I don't think so

<ICE-SIN:S1B-042#57:1:D>
Uh my observation is that those students who really do well uh in
life are people who have uh good academic certificates but who also have a
good ECA track record

<ICE-SIN:S1B-042#58:1:D>
Uh they manage to do both and in fact some of them tell me that
because of their ECA activities uhm uh they are able to relax they're even
able to do better in their academic work you know they don't become stale in
other words

<$E> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-042#59:1:E>
What about the slower students who are already having problem
coping with their uh formal curriculum

<$D> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-042#60:1:D>
Well I think the balance has been struck at every level but it
is possible even at for average students to pay attention to both and do
better

<ICE-SIN:S1B-042#61:1:D>
Uhm just imagine a student who is not very good in his studies and
you do nothing but lock him up in a room to do his studies right

<ICE-SIN:S1B-042#62:1:D>
Do you think that student will somehow improve in his studies

<ICE-SIN:S1B-042#63:1:D>
I think he will become very bored very stale his mind will be
switched off

<ICE-SIN:S1B-042#64:1:D>
But if you allow him daily to have a little bit of uhm uh healthy
sporting activity his mind will be refreshed

<ICE-SIN:S1B-042#65:1:D>
I think he'll come back to his studies with more interest

<$E> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-042#66:1:E>
What would you tell parents who think that ECA is robbing
their children's studying time

<$D> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-042#67:1:D>
I would advise them that uhm they should think of the total
development of their children

<ICE-SIN:S1B-042#68:1:D>
Uh there are many examples of children who do extremely well in
their academic studies who later on in life do not do well uh in the sense
that their personalities are incomplete they lack self-confidence uhm and
even though they may have got good grades they are not effective as adults
and that's a real pity

<ICE-SIN:S1B-042#69:1:D>
If they had uh balanced programs in school where studies on one
hand is important but uh at the same time they give make effort in ECA uh in
ECA activities and develop their character their personality I think they
make more successful adults

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-042#70:1:A>
And that was Dr Tay Eng Soon talking about the importance of
ECA

<ICE-SIN:S1B-042#71:1:A>
His view is shared by two principals Mr Jumaat Mazdawood of
Clementi Town Primary and Mrs Pearl Goh from Ping Yi Secondary School

<ICE-SIN:S1B-042#72:1:A>
In this report Zainal Abidin they will be implementing this new
vision of ECA in their schools

<$F> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-042#73:1:F>
Mr Jumaat Mazdawud said that the suggestion of offering a
wider exposure of ECA is especially best for primary school students

<ICE-SIN:S1B-042#74:1:F>
He believes that these students should be exposed to a variety of
ECA so that they could make a more prudent choice of what to specialise in at
the secondary school level and this means opening up the extra-curricular
activities to lower primary school students as well however in this case
there would be some restrictions

<$G> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-042#75:1:G>
It is quite obvious that uh if we were to allow the lower
primary pupils access to ECA it must be some kind of activity where it may
not be too strenuous for them 'cos uh their body structure I think limits the
the kind of activities that are available to them

<ICE-SIN:S1B-042#76:1:G>
But I do believe pupils at primary two or even at primary one if
they do have the the the uh need and that that interest uh together with
parental support uh in ECA activities such as uh music uh dancing uh and a
host of others which uhm may be of interest to these younger pupils

<ICE-SIN:S1B-042#77:1:G>
They should be given all help and all assistance to participate in
these kind of activities

<$F> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-042#78:1:F>
The range of activities and research will include the more
specialised ones such as mountaineering ballet sea sport and music that's
very much in demand now

<ICE-SIN:S1B-042#79:1:F>
In such cases professional help would be necessary and this would
mean a definite increase in the cost of running ECA programs

<ICE-SIN:S1B-042#80:1:F>
Who'd pay for this increase in costs

<$G> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-042#81:1:G>
Now hopefully with the release of Medisave parents may now
find it a little bit easier to group together via the school system uh to
employ maybe specialised instructors uh which may be available outside uh the
school system and which we can more or less work together uh to garner these
resources for the benefit of the pupils

<ICE-SIN:S1B-042#82:1:G>
At present the schools are subsidising almost all the activities
that are provided in the schools but if they were to engage more specialised
instructors it would imply that or rather it would mean that the cost of
instruction would go up and uh for a school with limited funds to embark on
such a project I would expect uh some input uh to be allowed uh from on the
part of parents to subsidise or part of the the training program for the
pupils

<$F> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-042#83:1:F>
In ensuring that cost of the ECA program do not go up
unnecessarily Mrs Pearl Goh principal of Ping Yi Secondary School said she
would rely on a wide-ranging skills of the teachers in improving her school's
ECA programs

<ICE-SIN:S1B-042#84:1:F>
This she said would also reduce the undue stress of the teachers if
they have to learn and instruct new skills not familiar to them

<$H> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-042#85:1:H>
What we do in Ping Yi is to exploit potential within our
teachers

<ICE-SIN:S1B-042#86:1:H>
They come actually loaded with gifts and skills it's a matter of
finding out and deploying them

<ICE-SIN:S1B-042#87:1:H>
So what we try to offer the students uh areas that the teachers
could offer in terms of let's say an enrichment program uh teaching Japanese
or teaching the boys how to cook and manage a home uhm plastic making
artifacts these are some of the things that my teachers have so I've not gone
to any extra expense of having them trained

<ICE-SIN:S1B-042#88:1:H>
We pick out these and then we try to structure program for the
students

<$F> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-042#89:1:F>
But Pearl admitted undoubtedly there will be an increase in
the ECA expense if we are going to provide a more generous spread of
activities to the students

<ICE-SIN:S1B-042#90:1:F>
According to her ECA expenditure that exceeds the 500 dollars a
year given by the Ministry of Education is covered through her hard work of
getting donations from organisations like the Shaw Foundation and when I ask
her what more she thinks the ministry should offer she said

<$H> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-042#91:1:H>
Well I feel that the Ministry of Education could provide some
of the more expensive items for example in some health clubs they've this
very sophisticated machinery where you could have a a group of students at
the different posts uhm keeping fit at the same time

<ICE-SIN:S1B-042#92:1:H>
I would love to have <unclear> word </unclear> and this machinery
and support uh machinery for the children to do to keep fit on rainy days for
example when they can't do their P.E. outside they could go to this room and
the teachers and and and I could also enjoy it

<$F> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-042#93:1:F>
Finally when asked if she foresees any problem in implementing
this new expanded ECA program she confidently replied

<$H> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-042#94:1:H>
You give us the machinery we will schedule it

<ICE-SIN:S1B-042#95:1:H>
I think principals are known to be very very creative and very
innovative

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-042#96:1:A>
Mrs Pearl Goh so it looks like students at all levels can look
forward to a more enriching ECA program in the years to come and with that
we've come to the end of today's program
