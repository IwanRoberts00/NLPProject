Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen

<ICE-SIN:S2A-055#2:1:A>
Welcome to our Wordstar for Windows Launch

<ICE-SIN:S2A-055#3:1:A>
Uhm today we'll be presenting to you the first ever recipient of PC
User Gold Award winner which is of a word itself window

<ICE-SIN:S2A-055#4:1:A>
And today's programme will also include a slide presentation by Mr
Michael Wee followed by a highlight of today's program a demonstration of
Wordstar for Windows by Ms Irene Khoo

<ICE-SIN:S2A-055#5:1:A>
Irene will also show you the correct grammar and the bitstream base
lift which is also binded in our program

<ICE-SIN:S2A-055#6:1:A>
After the coffee break we will have a round of lucky draw and
several announcements

<ICE-SIN:S2A-055#7:1:A>
So without further ado I'll like to call upon Mr Michael Wee
Regional Sales Manager of Wordstar Asia to introduce Wordstar for Windows to
you

<ICE-SIN:S2A-055#8:1:A>
Michael

<ICE-SIN:S2A-055#9:1:A>
Please don't please don't stop

<ICE-SIN:S2A-055#10:1:A>
Hi

<ICE-SIN:S2A-055#11:1:A>
Uh it's good to see all of you and it's very reassuring to know
that the name Wordstar can still draw this type of interest

<ICE-SIN:S2A-055#12:1:A>
Uh I know that's partly also due to the Windows environment but I'm
very very sure that most of you are here because of Wordstar right

<ICE-SIN:S2A-055#13:1:A>
Say yes

<ICE-SIN:S2A-055#14:1:A>
Louder

<ICE-SIN:S2A-055#15:1:A>
Yes well we'll try again later afterwards

<ICE-SIN:S2A-055#16:1:A>
Alright you know many many years ago uh Wordstar was the number one
in the PC environment where wordprocessing is concerned and if I'm not wrong
most of you if not all of you started using Wordstar for the word-processing

<ICE-SIN:S2A-055#17:1:A>
Yes see I told you

<ICE-SIN:S2A-055#18:1:A>
It's getting better good but then somewhere along the way uh we
admit we slacken a little bit and thereby we let a lot of other competitors
came into the picture

<ICE-SIN:S2A-055#19:1:A>
They caught up with us and they have also to a certain extent
overtaken us so much so that whenever now people are looking into
word-processing perhaps one of the questions they will ask is why Wordstar
and not something else unlike before where is why something else and not the
Wordstar

<ICE-SIN:S2A-055#20:1:A>
Well for the first part of the presentation I'm going to show you
why you should consider or reconsider Wordstar because we have gone through a
lot of changes so much so that we we're able to get our windows product out
in time long before our competitor that is our main competitor

<ICE-SIN:S2A-055#21:1:A>
I don't like to mention names here but uh I believe you know uh
which one I'm referring to

<ICE-SIN:S2A-055#22:1:A>
Okay

<ICE-SIN:S2A-055#23:1:A>
Alright is it a bit too is it a bit too dark

<ICE-SIN:S2A-055#24:1:A>
Nuh

<ICE-SIN:S2A-055#25:1:A>
Okay

<ICE-SIN:S2A-055#26:1:A>
Okay

<ICE-SIN:S2A-055#27:1:A>
Alright because I've got to be able to see my script otherwise I'll
won't be able to say what I'm supposed to say

<ICE-SIN:S2A-055#28:1:A>
Alright don't worry

<ICE-SIN:S2A-055#29:1:A>
Okay now despite the lapse uh that Wordstar has fallen into we are
actually still the number two wordprocessing company in terms of the number
of units shipped

<ICE-SIN:S2A-055#30:1:A>
Alright we are the number two word-processor for DOS units shipped

<ICE-SIN:S2A-055#31:1:A>
It may surprise a lot of you but this is true uh okay

<ICE-SIN:S2A-055#32:1:A>
Just just before I carry on can those people at the back hear me

<ICE-SIN:S2A-055#33:1:A>
Oh you can hear me but you can't see me is it

<ICE-SIN:S2A-055#34:1:A>
This light here

<ICE-SIN:S2A-055#35:1:A>
Okay can we have this lights

<ICE-SIN:S2A-055#36:1:A>
It's much better now

<ICE-SIN:S2A-055#37:1:A>
Can you still see me but I have a problem here because now I can't
see my script but that's alright

<ICE-SIN:S2A-055#38:1:A>
We'd I'll just carry on from here uh we have sold over five million
copies

<ICE-SIN:S2A-055#39:1:A>
We have a strong brand name recognition and I think no one here
will dispute that because even though many of you may have been using other
word-processing software you will still know the name Wordstar

<ICE-SIN:S2A-055#40:1:A>
We have a proven distribution engine which I will show you because
we have a very wide um distributor network that covers a lot of the countries

<ICE-SIN:S2A-055#41:1:A>
We are the nineteenth largest PC software companies in States

<ICE-SIN:S2A-055#42:1:A>
Uh we employ about slightly less than 280 employees

<ICE-SIN:S2A-055#43:1:A>
Our last year revenue was thirty-five million

<ICE-SIN:S2A-055#44:1:A>
Alright we take a look at this graph

<ICE-SIN:S2A-055#45:1:A>
You'll find that WordStar is number two in terms of its DOS units
shipped

<ICE-SIN:S2A-055#46:1:A>
Uh the first one of course you can see for yourself

<ICE-SIN:S2A-055#47:1:A>
I won't tell you too much about that

<ICE-SIN:S2A-055#48:1:A>
Right we have overseas office in all these countries that you see
here

<ICE-SIN:S2A-055#49:1:A>
Very few very few software companies do have this kind of coverage
as we do

<ICE-SIN:S2A-055#50:1:A>
They they do have distributors all over the world like like we do
but they do not have the subsidiaries in this country

<ICE-SIN:S2A-055#51:1:A>
The reason why we have set up subsidiaries in all these countries
is because we realize we have to get close to the consumer

<ICE-SIN:S2A-055#52:1:A>
We have to get close to people like in order to react faster to the
market changes in order to know what you people want us to do and thereby
come up with something better

<ICE-SIN:S2A-055#53:1:A>
So this is a very different WordStar you are looking at now

<ICE-SIN:S2A-055#54:1:A>
And what actually is different in WordStar

<ICE-SIN:S2A-055#55:1:A>
Well first of all we've now got a new leadership new management
team

<ICE-SIN:S2A-055#56:1:A>
Uh if you are familiar or you're aware with the software industry
in the States Mr Ron Posner has now joined us as CEO

<ICE-SIN:S2A-055#57:1:A>
Mr Posner has a very impressive track record in AshtonTate in
Symantech

<ICE-SIN:S2A-055#58:1:A>
Now uh ye when he was there the companies have managed to triple or
quadruple their earnings during his tenure in the companies there

<ICE-SIN:S2A-055#59:1:A>
Uh we've got a new product strategy of which you'll be seeing this
this afternoon

<ICE-SIN:S2A-055#60:1:A>
We've also focussed on very aggressive marketing

<ICE-SIN:S2A-055#61:1:A>
We've done a lot of very aggressive funding agreement

<ICE-SIN:S2A-055#62:1:A>
I'm sure you know about it in the past

<ICE-SIN:S2A-055#63:1:A>
And this new management team has taken a different approach

<ICE-SIN:S2A-055#64:1:A>
What Mr Ron Posner is looking at is into software companies that he
can buy that will be complementary to the WordStar

<ICE-SIN:S2A-055#65:1:A>
Hah

<ICE-SIN:S2A-055#66:1:A>
I didn't know that

<ICE-SIN:S2A-055#67:1:A>
Thanks

<ICE-SIN:S2A-055#68:1:A>
Okay uh complementary products into the WordStar wordprocessing
environment

<ICE-SIN:S2A-055#69:1:A>
Then we've now also because of this new management team we've
managed to create a a new company image

<ICE-SIN:S2A-055#70:1:A>
Now product pres product strategy is to build wordprocessing into
document management

<ICE-SIN:S2A-055#71:1:A>
Document management basically covers a wider arena of uh what
wordprocessing is all about

<ICE-SIN:S2A-055#72:1:A>
Document management

<ICE-SIN:S2A-055#73:1:A>
You'll be talking about desktop publishing

<ICE-SIN:S2A-055#74:1:A>
You'll be talking about microfilms

<ICE-SIN:S2A-055#75:1:A>
You'll be talking about laser worms and all these kind of things

<ICE-SIN:S2A-055#76:1:A>
So we're building wordprocessing into this document management and
in the near future you'll be seeing more products towards this aspect

<ICE-SIN:S2A-055#77:1:A>
Of course we'll keep upgrading our DOS product

<ICE-SIN:S2A-055#78:1:A>
DOS at this present time remains a very important market to us

<ICE-SIN:S2A-055#79:1:A>
Even though Windows as we all know is getting very popular but in
terms of the number of installed units DOS by far outskips Windows still </I>


<I>

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-055#80:2:B>
You can and you need to access your uh head office information
right

<ICE-SIN:S2A-055#81:2:B>
You need your head office information at your fingertip

<ICE-SIN:S2A-055#82:2:B>
All you need is one-touch tone telephone

<ICE-SIN:S2A-055#83:2:B>
You make one phone call you can access your phone messages

<ICE-SIN:S2A-055#84:2:B>
You can send phone messages

<ICE-SIN:S2A-055#85:2:B>
Your electronic mail right

<ICE-SIN:S2A-055#86:2:B>
Your computer mail can read to you over the phone

<ICE-SIN:S2A-055#87:2:B>
We're talking about text-voice conversion

<ICE-SIN:S2A-055#88:2:B>
It means it's like your sec your secretary reading the mail to you
saying Mr Manager

<ICE-SIN:S2A-055#89:2:B>
You know this is your letter blah blah blah blah everything dollars
and cent

<ICE-SIN:S2A-055#90:2:B>
How many thousand dollars

<ICE-SIN:S2A-055#91:2:B>
How many cents you know the address and stuff like that

<ICE-SIN:S2A-055#92:2:B>
It's very fast

<ICE-SIN:S2A-055#93:2:B>
<X> Customer: So uh what kind of e-mail system that it can able to
</X>

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-055#94:2:B>
What kind of computer do you have <X>

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-055#X95:2:B>
Let's say Bayan buy or Novell Bayang or Novell </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-055#96:2:B>
Uh is that IBM compatible

<ICE-SIN:S2A-055#97:2:B>
Without a PC

<ICE-SIN:S2A-055#98:2:B>
It's a PCC uh

<ICE-SIN:S2A-055#99:2:B>
It's IBM compatible

<ICE-SIN:S2A-055#100:2:B>
I believe Bayang <unclear> word </unclear> is IBM compatible

<ICE-SIN:S2A-055#101:2:B>
Yes uh it connects to IBM computer HP Deck <unclear> word
</unclear> Unisyss <unclear> word </unclear>

<ICE-SIN:S2A-055#102:2:B>
Honeywell NCR

<ICE-SIN:S2A-055#103:2:B>
A lot of computers

<ICE-SIN:S2A-055#104:2:B>
Eight or nine okay

<ICE-SIN:S2A-055#105:2:B>
So so the electronic mail right it can read to you over the phone

<ICE-SIN:S2A-055#106:2:B>
If you do not want it to read to you you want it in hard copy
right that means on paper right you can tell the system send my electronic
mail all my fax to the nearest fax machine that's closest to me

<ICE-SIN:S2A-055#107:2:B>
Say for example you're flying on a plane and there is a fax
machine on the plane you can tell the system send my electronic mail and the
fax to the fax machine on the plane itself

<ICE-SIN:S2A-055#108:2:B>
So all you have to do is just walk up to the aisle from the to the
<unclear> word </unclear> fax machine just put there on the plane itself

<ICE-SIN:S2A-055#109:2:B>
You can do all that anywhere in the world as long as you have a
touch-tone telephone you can access all those information

<ICE-SIN:S2A-055#110:2:B>
So the versatile versatility lies in the fact that your elec your
computer mail computer uh fax can be converted into voice or into fax
anywhere in the world <X>

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-055#X111:2:C>
So uh to make up this system what what are the minimum uh
software </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-055#112:2:B>
Okay

<ICE-SIN:S2A-055#113:2:B>
You you need to buy this product called <unclear> word </unclear>

<ICE-SIN:S2A-055#114:2:B>
The computer is right over there You see the black box over there

<ICE-SIN:S2A-055#115:2:B>
It says centigram voice-processing system

<ICE-SIN:S2A-055#116:2:B>
You need to buy one of the box

<ICE-SIN:S2A-055#117:2:B>
That's it <X>

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-055#X118:2:C>
So this this system is a PC-based system or a </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-055#119:2:B>
The box is some sort of computer a very specialized computer
<X>

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-055#X120:2:C>
May have your own uh telephone <unclear> word </unclear> to
uh sort of </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-055#121:2:B>
You have a PBX in your office <X>

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-055#X122:2:C>
Yep ya we have Must we connect to the PBX </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-055#123:2:B>
Sure if you it <unclear> word </unclear> connects to the PBX
then you integrate everything because PBX is connected to the fax machine
right VYour fax machine is connected to the PBX <X>

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-055#X124:2:C>
But those whom without a PBX they cannot do all these </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-055#125:2:B>
Key telephone system also can

<ICE-SIN:S2A-055#126:2:B>
Best is PBX

<ICE-SIN:S2A-055#127:2:B>
But key telephone system also can but very basic

<ICE-SIN:S2A-055#128:2:B>
So this is very versatile very powerful <X>

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-055#X129:2:B>
Okay Thank you </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-055#130:2:B>
Most welcome <X>

<ICE-SIN:S2A-055#X131:2:B>
BK Can you show me this </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-055#132:2:B>
Okay

<ICE-SIN:S2A-055#133:2:B>
This is based on uh this is using your <unclear> word </unclear>
technology okay

<ICE-SIN:S2A-055#134:2:B>
Say for example uhm you your CEO is on the tenth floor and you're
on the fifth floor and your CEO wants to talk to you

<ICE-SIN:S2A-055#135:2:B>
So the on your CEO computer there's a box down here that says
voice and it has your phone number on it

<ICE-SIN:S2A-055#136:2:B>
The CEO takes this pen uh light-pen and hit that box the computer
will dial your extension and then you say Yes Mr CEO what can I do for you

<ICE-SIN:S2A-055#137:2:B>
Okay maybe he will say I want to talk to you about last month's
sales progress okay

<ICE-SIN:S2A-055#138:2:B>
So on uh your CEO will pull out a document from his PC on the
screen right the same document will appear on your screen also

<ICE-SIN:S2A-055#139:2:B>
So both of you are watching the same document and while you're
having a voice-communica cation through the phone right that means a speaker
phone you talk to him right at the same time you say Yes Mr CEO I I'm I think
uh maybe you're looking at this figure

<ICE-SIN:S2A-055#140:2:B>
At the same time you can see this is it

<ICE-SIN:S2A-055#141:2:B>
So the thing is this is not restricted to just within the building

<ICE-SIN:S2A-055#142:2:B>
You can it it can be done uhm different countries

<ICE-SIN:S2A-055#143:2:B>
Say you're in Singapore CEO is in New York city okay

<ICE-SIN:S2A-055#144:2:B>
He'll call you up

<ICE-SIN:S2A-055#145:2:B>
It's as though like he's just next to you

<ICE-SIN:S2A-055#146:2:B>
You don't have to fly from Singapore to New York city and this is
very cheap

<ICE-SIN:S2A-055#147:2:B>
You don't have to buy PC and whatever it is

<ICE-SIN:S2A-055#148:2:B>
Uh you already have PC already right

<ICE-SIN:S2A-055#149:2:B>
Uh IBM compatible PC and PS2 or or Ps PS2

<ICE-SIN:S2A-055#150:2:B>
There's a few cards you just slot inside it runs <unclear> word
</unclear> loads some software inside

<ICE-SIN:S2A-055#151:2:B>
That is it <X>

<ICE-SIN:S2A-055#X152:2:B>
C2: It's sort of special monitor </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-055#153:2:B>
It's not

<ICE-SIN:S2A-055#154:2:B>
That's a normal printer

<ICE-SIN:S2A-055#155:2:B>
All you need is the product is actually only a few cards and some
software <X>

<ICE-SIN:S2A-055#X156:2:B>
C2: What are the cards that you </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-055#157:2:B>
Uhm it's it's it's inside uh <X>

<ICE-SIN:S2A-055#X158:2:B>
C2 Is it in the brochure they gave us at the front </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-055#159:2:B>
No there's no brochure for this

<ICE-SIN:S2A-055#160:2:B>
We're we're just marketing this product we're not sellers

<ICE-SIN:S2A-055#161:2:B>
We we just want to okay we want to introduce this product to all
to the public let people know that this product is available

<ICE-SIN:S2A-055#162:2:B>
See the the reason is ISDN is too expensive for most people

<ICE-SIN:S2A-055#163:2:B>
Too expensive and because it's too expensive nobody wants to use
it and because nobody want very few people want to use it problem correct

<ICE-SIN:S2A-055#164:2:B>
So right now if you tell everybody and we have and we find out
that there's a large demand for this then we can immediately lower down the
ISDN offer <X>

<ICE-SIN:S2A-055#X165:2:B>
This <unclear> word </unclear> technique uh So we're actually
quite <unclear> word </unclear> C2: What is this product called

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-055#X166:2:A>
Uh it's called uh ISDN information integrator C2: From which
company

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-055#X167:2:A>
It's uh joint-venture between an American company and
British C2: Not launched yet

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-055#X168:2:A>
Not launched yet This one is also not launched it's making
its debut But uhm it will help uh it will be launched in a few months' time
Have I explained to you uh this one BK: No

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-055#X169:2:A>
Okay Say for example you're an executive on the move right
and you <unclear> word </unclear> you need some information from your head
office at your fingertips and all you need is one touch of telephone you make
one phone-call can access your phone messages you can send phone messages
These are just some some of the crazy <unclear> word </unclear> there are
some more much much more inside If I just want <unclear> word </unclear>
electronic mail It can read to you your electronic mail to you over the phone
That means it's converting from text to <unclear> word </unclear> and or you
can send uhm you can send your e-mail or your faxes to any fax machine that's
nearest to you say like you're on you're on a plane there's a fax machine on
the plane you can tell the system send the e-mail and the fax to you on the
plane itself So very very powerful and it makes use of existing facilities
just like existing facilities you need a few cards right So it make use of
existing phone system computer system and a fax machine You already all have
these in the office already Right now the problem is they are not integrated
they are not talking to each other They are all isolated So if you buy this
uh product it integrates all these together So your this electronic mail can
be converted into voice or converted into text Anywhere in the world you have
a touch-tone telephone can be accessed all these It's very very powerful BK:
So this is the phone

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-055#X170:2:A>
Any phone BK: Oh any phone

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-055#X171:2:A>
You don't need a special phone A touch-tone telephone that's
all BK: Thank you

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-055#X172:2:A>
Welcome </X> </I>
