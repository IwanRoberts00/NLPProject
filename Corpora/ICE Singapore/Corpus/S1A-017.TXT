<I>

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#1:1:A>
<unclear> word </unclear> I want you to tell me how much to
change

<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#2:1:A>
Okay but have you decided roughly what <unclear> word </unclear>
amount

<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#3:1:A>
I don't know how much you want

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#4:1:B>
What is the estimate

<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#5:1:B>
Have you all decided or not

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#6:1:A>
Have not decided

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#7:1:B>
Because eight hundred you all were saying for the food and the
no for accommodation and entrance fees right

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#8:1:A>
Ya

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#9:1:B>
But then

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#10:1:C>
You got the breakdown or not

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#11:1:B>
Maybe you can ask uh Beng what is the best best op

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#12:1:A>
Do you know how much currency we need to bring

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#13:1:B>
How much are you estimating for food let's say per meal

<$D> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#14:1:D>
I don't know

<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#15:1:D>
Just bringing two thousand dollars

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#16:1:B>
Oh two thousand uh 

<$D> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#17:1:D>
Ya Then from there <unclear> word </unclear> 

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#18:1:B>
But how much are you going to change for each country

<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#19:1:B>
Five hundred

<$D> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#20:1:D>
When I go there then I know what

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#21:1:B>
Oh you're just bringing all cheques is it

<$D> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#22:1:D>
Ya <unclear> word </unclear> owes me two hundred and forty six
dollars

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#23:1:B>
But it's not in currency

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#24:1:C>
Ya

<$D> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#25:1:D>
Ha

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#26:1:B>
So Beng how how much do you think we should estimate per meals

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#27:1:C>
Forty twenty forty for accommodation twenty

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#28:1:B>
Per day

<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#29:1:B>
But our accommodation is all fostered in right now

<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#30:1:B>
In your latest

<$D> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#31:1:D>
Ya but I don't see I don't think you should count it that way

<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#32:1:D>
What I gave you was an estimate

<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#33:1:D>
I mean are you going to take take all the money out and then
separate out this is uh what moving money and that is <unclear> word
</unclear>

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#34:1:B>
That means right

<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#35:1:B>
So your two thousand includes what you have costed in your
itinerary plus food and souvenirs

<$D> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#36:1:D>
Ya ya the whole thing

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#37:1:B>
So that is about what we have calculated

<$ > 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#38:1> Two thousand

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#39:1:B>
Two thousand

<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#40:1:B>
So which means it's correct

<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#41:1:B>
You see it's about five hundred to <unclear> word </unclear>

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#42:1:A>
FIve hundred per country is it

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#43:1:B>
Ya

<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#44:1:B>
So if you go by her estimate in the write-up then that one each
country is about two hundred fifty

<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#45:1:B>
So we left about two hundred fifty for our own food and souvenirs

<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#46:1:B>
Then if want to bring some more cheques hor

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#47:1:C>
We only have four countries so <unclear> word </unclear>

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#48:1:B>
Two thousand uh

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#49:1:C>
Ya it's enough

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#50:1:B>
So that's why we were intending to ask him to

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#51:1:A>
<unclear> word </unclear> can you pass me your cash cheque

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#52:1:B>
Cheque

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#53:1:C>
Cheques

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#54:1:B>
And your name

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#55:1:A>
In my name uh

<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#56:1:A>
Oh okay lor

<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#57:1:A>
Okay okay in my name in my name

<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#58:1:A>
Then I write a cash cheque for them

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#59:1:C>
Oh to the

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#60:1:A>
Because uh the money people prefers cash cheques

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#61:1:C>
Oh I see

<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#62:1:C>
Are you going to bring traveller's cheques

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#63:1:A>
Ya traveller's cheques

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#64:1:C>
But are you going to bring cash as well

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#65:1:A>
Ya as well

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#66:1:C>
Mag leh

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#67:1:A>
You

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#68:1:C>
I'm intending to bring all cash you know

<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#69:1:C>
But make it a bit of traveller's cheques

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#70:1:A>
All cash huh

<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#71:1:A>
You know what I'm afraid of losing it you know

<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#72:1:A>
You don't know whether I'll lose it or not

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#73:1:C>
Two hundred and fifty

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#74:1:A>
Just in case

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#75:1:B>
Anyway we are we are sharing you know

<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#76:1:B>
So each one of us will be only be carrying two thousand dollars

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#77:1:C>
Two thousand

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#78:1:B>
For two currencies

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#79:1:A>
What you mean you are sharing

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#80:1:B>
She's going to hold two countries' currency

<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#81:1:B>
I'm going to hold two currencies

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#82:1:A>
Oh

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#83:1:B>
Then if you need

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#84:1:A>
Is that better

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#85:1:B>
Huh

<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#86:1:B>
I think just handling less currency that is all lah but

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#87:1:A>
Oh

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#88:1:B>
The amount of the amount spent is the same

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#89:1:A>
So you're just going to contribute into the pool lah or
something like that

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#90:1:B>
Actually we're not even contributing

<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#91:1:B>
I'll just buy for

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#92:1:A>
Ya lah ya lah

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#93:1:B>
you know how much for the currency

<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#94:1:B>
Come back then <unclear> word </unclear> whatever

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#95:1:A>
That's the receipt for Vicky

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#96:1:C>
For the Europass

<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#97:1:C>
So the Europass is four 0 nine right

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#98:1:A>
Ya <unclear> word </unclear> another four one

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#99:1:B>
Ya I'm going to write the cheque

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#100:1:C>
So how

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#101:1:A>
So can write me a cheque

<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#102:1:A>
Will it be

<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#103:1:A>
You have already

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#104:1:B>
Okay I have the cheque here no but the amount is not
specified

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#105:1:C>
<unclear> word </unclear> calculator

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#106:1:B>
Anybody got calculator

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#107:1:A>
I think I have I have a calculator

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#108:1:C>
Do you know the exchange rates

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#109:1:A>
No I don't know the exchange rates

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#110:1:C>
Exactly speaking

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#111:1:B>
Roughly

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#112:1:C>
Then based on this one right

<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#113:1:C>
Student

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#114:1:B>
Ya roughly

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#115:1:A>
But usually <unclear> word </unclear> Sing dollar two
thousand and then I'll change it for you five hundred per currency

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#116:1:B>
Ya

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#117:1:A>
or what

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#118:1:B>
But that means you will have very loose change right

<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#119:1:B>
You may come up to the last cent and all that

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#120:1:C>
Oh

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#121:1:A>
Uh

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#122:1:B>
I thought maybe we could do it the other way like five
hundred guilders or five thousand guilders then how much Sing dollars per
guilder <unclear> word </unclear>

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#123:1:A>
But that means four hundred and something Sing dollars
<unclear> word </unclear>

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#124:1:B>
Ah

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#125:1:A>
Oh

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#126:1:B>
Isn't it easier

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#127:1:A>
But the exchange you might not know the exchange rates or you
can roughly <unclear> word </unclear>

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#128:1:B>
Just a rough rough estimate

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#129:1:C>
Or is it easier to say I want uh five hundred worth of five
hundred Sing dollars worth of guilders

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#130:1:B>
Ya

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#131:1:C>
Then they just give you the amount

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#132:1:B>
Right

<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#133:1:B>
So you have come up with a few cents all the loose <unclear> word
</unclear>

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#134:1:C>
Is it easier this way or you're going to change

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#135:1:A>
But loose change is alright what

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#136:1:B>
They might not have loose change

<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#137:1:B>
In fact then they might want <unclear> word </unclear> Sing
dollars from you

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#138:1:C>
Then they might ask you to buy less Sing dollar uh

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#139:1:B>
Ya lor

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#140:1:A>
Doesn't matter lor

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#141:1:C>
Ya lah but roughly you would say okay about five hundred for
this currency

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#142:1:A>
But maximum two thousand right

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#143:1:C>
Ya

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#144:1:B>
Because if we if we calculate now we can roughly gauge like
the closest to five hundred

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#145:1:C>
Like okay Amsterdam is what ah

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#146:1:B>
This is already three zero one

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#147:1:C>
This is one currency right

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#148:1:B>
Ya

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#149:1:C>
Okay

<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#150:1:C>
This is about two seventy you know three about two seven something

<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#151:1:C>
Uh 'A' but this per person right

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#152:1:B>
Per person

<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#153:1:B>
Okay

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#154:1:C>
So if two persons you need three

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#155:1:B>
'A' how does it work

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#156:1:A>
There the numbers are here

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#157:1:B>
Oh okay

<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#158:1:B>
Three zero zero

<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#159:1:B>
Where is zero

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#160:1:A>
Here here

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#161:1:C>
Where's on and off

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#162:1:B>
Three zero zero times aiyuh so confusing looking at the
alphabets

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#163:1:A>
Wrong already

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#164:1:C>
Wrong already

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#165:1:B>
Three zero

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#166:1:A>
Hey I'm going to bring this along you know

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#167:1:C>
Ya I think this is useful

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#168:1:B>
Three zero one

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#169:1:A>
Are you sure

<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#170:1:A>
You can use point five

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#171:1:B>
Point aiyah multiply okay about six zero <unclear> word
</unclear> for food right

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#172:1:A>
Point two

<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#173:1:A>
Why multiply by two

<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#174:1:A>
Oh I see I see

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#175:1:B>
Two person

<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#176:1:B>
Two person will be six hundred and three

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#177:1:A>
Okay

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#178:1:B>
Time three

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#179:1:A>
Uhm then times point nine

<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#180:1:A>
Oh no for food only

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#181:1:C>
Ya this is only for food

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#182:1:B>
Aiyah don't need don't need

<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#183:1:B>
I'll just do it in Singapore's Singapore currency uh

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#184:1:A>
Ya then

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#185:1:B>
Ya okay two seven two seven one

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#186:1:C>
Two seven one point three nine

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#187:1:A>
Three nine

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#188:1:C>
One <unclear> word </unclear> is

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#189:1:B>
Two

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#190:1:A>
Five <unclear> word </unclear> : T

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#191:1:A>
Then my

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#192:1:B>
Ya terrible it's too close it's too close

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#193:1:A>
Aiyah come uh come uh

<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#194:1:A>
Two seven one point three five times two

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#195:1:B>
times two

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#196:1:A>
This and then so

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#197:1:B>
Bring up to a thousand dollars uh the closest times times two
again

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#198:1:C>
Why times two again

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#199:1:B>
Okay can you uhm oh

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#200:1:A>
Minus one thousand

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#201:1:B>
This okay this amount would be just

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#202:1:A>
Why don't you just calculate one thousand

<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#203:1:A>
Then you times <unclear> word </unclear>

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#204:1:C>
You might not have enough

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#205:1:B>
No this one is just for accommodation and entrance fees right

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#206:1:A>
Oh okay

<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#207:1:A>
Okay okay

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#208:1:B>
We need for meals and for

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#209:1:C>
So how

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#210:1:A>
Ya ya ya

<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#211:1:A>
So this is times two then

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#212:1:B>
You can times two again right

<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#213:1:B>
Only it's going to be another double of the amount of of

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#214:1:C>
Accommodation

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#215:1:B>
So got paper or not

<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#216:1:B>
Write down the

<$ > 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#217:1> Four

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#218:1:A>
That's a lot

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#219:1:C>
Ha

<ICE-SIN:S1A-017#220:1:C>
