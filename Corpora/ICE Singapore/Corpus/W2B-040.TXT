ENCARTA MULTIMEDIA ENCYCLOPEDIA

<ICE-SIN:W2B-040#7:1>
Published by Microsoft Home Series

<ICE-SIN:W2B-040#8:1>
These are the three top selling encyclopedia CD ROMs.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-040#9:1>
You can hardly go wrong choosing any one of them if all you want is an
encyclopedia on a disk for dipping into occasionally.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-040#10:1>
But if you are particular or have specific needs, you may find one
more satisfying than the other.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-040#11:1>
There are many common features.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-040#12:1>
All have compiled an amazing number of articles from documented
sources and impressive bibliography.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-040#13:1>
All need 4MB RAM to run well, although Encarta's Mac version prefers
5 to 8 MB.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-040#14:1>
Topics covered tend to fall into similar categories such as history,
geography, the arts and science.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-040#15:1>
All three have a timeline in which key events are laid out from year
dot to the present.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-040#16:1>
Differences are largely in depth and source of information, as well
as interface.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-040#17:1>
How significant these differences are depends on your needs and
preferences.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-040#18:1>
Multimedia features

<ICE-SIN:W2B-040#19:1>
These are what impresses in CD ROMs.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-040#20:1>
Grolier has 53 video clips in seven categories, including 16 great
historical events such as Charles Lindbergh's transatlantic flight.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-040#21:1>
Compton's 33 video, 12 animated clips and 54 slide shows are
impressive though the explanations are more suited to students.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-040#22:1>
Encarta's paltry 12 video is balanced by 89 animated videos which
range from an impressive explanation of the Doppler Effect to how a cat lands
on four feet.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-040#23:1>
Overall, Encarta has the most number of pictures, sound bites, video
clips and narrated animations and maps.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-040#24:1>
Search facilities

<ICE-SIN:W2B-040#25:1>
Grolier's search template has four fields to include or exclude words
or phrases, and can also be programmed to meet specific needs.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-040#26:1>
Articles are linked for quick cross reference.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-040#27:1>
Using the Knowledge Tree, you can search by six main topics, opening
up categories and subcategories and tabulated information.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-040#28:1>
Compton's Info Pilot links an article automatically to four related
articles which are useful if they are what you want but may be irrelevant.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-040#29:1>
Its Topic Tree, however, works better than Grolier's Knowledge Tree.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-040#30:1>
Compton's Expert Mode is also brilliant in giving the user limitless
work space which can be saved and returned to at the next session.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-040#31:1>
Encarta's equivalent is its Find Wizard which opens up into an
elaborate template from which to choose from nine topics.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-040#32:1>
You can narrow your search by keying the dates, place and other
parameters.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-040#33:1>
By the way, you can't beat Encarta for its picture quality.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-040#34:1>
Ease of learning and use

<ICE-SIN:W2B-040#35:1>
This is important because nothing puts one off more than software
that takes ages to learn.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-040#36:1>
The most intuitive of the three is Compton's, which makes it best
suited to children and younger students.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-040#37:1>
Grolier is most user-friendly with a well-planned tool pallet.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-040#38:1>
It comes with a well-planned, no-nonsense user's guide which contains
notes to a guided tour, and tips on research.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-040#39:1>
Encarta has the most elaborate and attractive user's guide with
cartoon drawings to make the learning process simple and painless, if a
little childish.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-040#40:1>
Help for the researcher is in a separate booklet that is a little
more serious and an excellent tool for new researchers.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-040#41:1>
It even has a chapter on how to write a research paper.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-040#42:1>
On balance

<ICE-SIN:W2B-040#43:1>
Choose Grolier for its comprehensive and in-depth information from
highly-regarded sources.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-040#44:1>
Encarta is a CD ROM lover's delight, which the information does not
match.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-040#45:1>
Compton's sits between the other two in terms of multimedia features
and information.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-040#46:1>
The bottom line: Grolier for serious encyclopedia user; Encarta for
the CD ROM enthusiast; Compton's for a relative new-comer to both.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-040#47:1>
CD titles for PCs were evaluated on NEC's Power-mate 425i PC, NEC's
Multisync monitor and NEC's triple speed CD drive.

<h> Sound advice on CD ROMs </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-040#50:1>
By Lulin Reutens and M K Wong

<ICE-SIN:W2B-040#51:1>
Sound is only one of the three components of a CD ROM.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-040#52:1>
Although sometimes not absolutely essential, good sound can add much
pleasure to the enjoyment of CD ROMs.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-040#53:1>
However, many new users have encountered problems in trying to get
the sound working.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-040#54:1>
WHAT SOUND?

<ICE-SIN:W2B-040#55:1>
To understand the situation, it is important to know that there are
three sources of sound from a PC with a CD ROM drive.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-040#56:1>
If only some sound or no sound at all is heard, it usually means that
one of the three sources is not connected, or initialised.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-040#57:1>
Digitised & synthesized sounds

<ICE-SIN:W2B-040#58:1>
A CD ROM which contains, say, an encyclopaedia, is likely to have two
types of sounds:

<ICE-SIN:W2B-040#59:1>
· Digitized sound, which is a close representation of the original
sound, is usually used for narration, ie voice.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-040#60:1>
Synthesized ( or midi, which stands for musical instrument digital
interface) sound is usually used for music.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-040#61:1>
It is actually a mathematical formula which gives only an
approximation of the sound of a particular musical instrument.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-040#62:1>
The quality of the music produced is nothing like digital sound.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-040#63:1>
The reason midi sound is used in CD ROMs is that it takes up less
disk space - as little as one per cent.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-040#64:1>
Midi sound is used mostly in games and encyclopaedia CD ROMs.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-040#65:1>
If your system is not set up properly, you may not hear the midi
sound.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-040#66:1>
So music or perhaps background sounds may not be heard.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-040#67:1>
If some sounds can't be heard, you can re-run the set-up program for
the sound card and run the diagnostic program to make sure both types of
sounds are audible.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-040#68:1>
Both types of sound from a CD ROM disk is heard through the speakers
connected to the soundcard's output jack.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-040#69:1>
Audio-format sound

<ICE-SIN:W2B-040#70:1>
The third type of sound is the music which comes from playing an
audio CD in a CD ROM drive.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-040#71:1>
The data ( ie sound) is output via the headphone jack in the front
panel of the drive.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-040#72:1>
Musical CD ROMs

<ICE-SIN:W2B-040#73:1>
Some CD ROM disks, such as those from Microsoft Home's series,
contain a combination of all three types of sound.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-040#74:1>
The extra track of audio-format sound is usually used for
high-quality recordings of classical music.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-040#75:1>
This technology has enabled CD ROM users to enjoy music of a quality
as good as that from audio CD players.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-040#76:1>
Such CD ROM disks can also be played with a normal CD player for the
music portions.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-040#77:1>
WHEN TO USE 2 PAIRS OF SPEAKERS?

<ICE-SIN:W2B-040#78:1>
In the set-up described above, you need two pairs of speakers - one
for the sound card, the other for the headphone jack.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-040#79:1>
But this means extra expense.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-040#80:1>
It is possible to connect the components so you need only one pair.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-040#81:1>
This is how it is done: Of the three jacks in the soundcard, one is
the line out for the speakers.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-040#82:1>
Another is for the microphone.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-040#83:1>
The third is a line in.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-040#84:1>
Using a cable with RCA jacks at both ends, connect the headphone jack
of the drive to the line in of the sound card.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-040#85:1>
This can be done only if your CD ROM drive is external.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-040#86:1>
For internal drives, the connection is made internally.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-040#87:1>
However, if sound quality is important to you, be warned that such a
connection will affect the quality of the sound, especially the music.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-040#89:1>
<h> TRUE COLOURS </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-040#90:1>
The war among colour inkjet printers is fierce and fiery.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-040#91:1>
Canon fired the first salvo by handing out folders with print samples
of its Canon JC-600 alongside with Hewlett-Packard's Deskjet 550C showing the
latter the worse in comparison.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-040#92:1>
Last month Epson joined the fray when it too handed out folders
comparing print samples of its brand new Epson colour Stylus with the Canon
and HP printers.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-040#93:1>
Obviously Epson's printout of the " fruit basket" scanned-image came
out best with the HP560C coming out better than the Canon BJC600.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-040#94:1>
Two weeks later, HP could stand it no longer and issued out " several
hundred" colour print sample folders to their dealers.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-040#95:1>
There is obviously a lesson to learn here.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-040#96:1>
It is clear that there is a way of making print samples of one
printer look better - or worse - than another.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-040#97:1>
But how?

<ICE-SIN:W2B-040#98:1>
Here are some suggestions from several industry-insiders:

<ICE-SIN:W2B-040#99:1>
· Printers are usually optimised for use with certain types of paper.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-040#100:1>
Using the right paper produces better results.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-040#101:1>
Even the right paper will produce poor results if it has
deteriorated because of dampness.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-040#102:1>
Altering the " Bleed Control" settings or overriding the automatic
mode will affect the printout adversely.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-040#103:1>
Some printers work better with scanned images while others print
better patterns.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-040#104:1>
An outdated printer driver will also affect the printout.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-040#105:1>
So how can consumers find out more accurately what a colour inkjet
printer can really do?

<ICE-SIN:W2B-040#106:1>
The experts have some advice too.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-040#107:1>
Insist on an on-the-spot printing test on plain photocopying paper.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-040#108:1>
Use the same graphics and drivers to test your next preferred
printer.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-040#109:1>
Tests should be made on the type of work you normally do.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-040#110:1>
Of course some dealers may not let you do all that, but at least now
you know!

<ICE-SIN:W2B-040#111:1>
And you may be lucky enough to find a friendly dealer.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-040#112:1>
BIG DEAL.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-040#113:1>
The " Biggest NoteBook Computer Sale" held at the Funan Centre
recently didn't quite live up to its name.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-040#114:1>
There were just 10 booths consisting of mostly newcomers to Funan
Centre and to the notebook scene, with the exception of Addon Systems, Votrex
and South Asia.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-040#115:1>
On the first morning of the show, an amused notebook dealer on the
fifth floor observed: " Look at those poor guys trying to do a demonstration!

<ICE-SIN:W2B-040#116:1>
Anybody who knows just a bit about notebooks will know that the
bright sunlight from the skylight will make the LCD screens unreadable, let
alone impress would-be customers".

<ICE-SIN:W2B-040#117:1>
Still, good try, Pidemco.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-040#118:1>
SIM LIM SCENE

<ICE-SIN:W2B-040#119:1>
Things are moving again at Singapore's second oldest computer-mart.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-040#120:1>
It seems that quite a few computer dealers have moved out following
a rather substantial rental hike.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-040#121:1>
Some moved to Funan Centre and others elsewhere.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-040#122:1>
Most complained bitterly about how hard it was to live with high
overheads.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-040#123:1>
One computer vendor obviously thinks otherwise.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-040#124:1>
Gravis has just taken out a big shop on the fourth floor lining it
wall-to-wall with one of the biggest collections of computer systems,
peripherals and accessories, second only to the Challenger Superstore in
Funan.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-040#125:1>
ut there is a major difference and one that matters too!

<ICE-SIN:W2B-040#126:1>
The prices at Sim Lim Square are much lower!

<ICE-SIN:W2B-040#127:1>
<h> Getting the best out of client/server Don't just introduce
client/server technology for the sake of it.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-040#128:1>
Use it to solve business problems </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-040#129:1>
By PETER GOH

<ICE-SIN:W2B-040#130:1>
Client/server technology is not necessarily a faster, cheaper or
easier alternative to mainframe computing.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-040#131:1>
It is also not the answer to every business problem.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-040#132:1>
Hence, to be able to get the best out of client/server technology,
it is crucial to apply it to the right situation.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-040#133:1>
Organisations which have successfully implemented client/server
technology did so to solve business problems rather than merely introduce a
new technology.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-040#134:1>
Client/server computing is justifiable if it is done as part of
business process re-design which involves re-thinking existing applications
to remove non-value-added activities.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-040#135:1>
Client/server technology can be a key technology for implementing
business changes.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-040#136:1>
ONE CASE STUDY

<ICE-SIN:W2B-040#137:1>
The experience of a social security department of a European country
bore this out.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-040#138:1>
Instead of simply implementing new information technologies, the
department wanted to have new ways of delivering benefits, including social
security, unemployment and child support to more than 20 million people.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-040#139:1>
It then decided on a revamp of the way its 80,000 civil servants in
1,800 locations did their jobs.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-040#140:1>
The department wanted to develop a holistic approach to delivering
benefits, integrating on one terminal a complete picture of each person's
situation, including all benefits and payments.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-040#141:1>
A good job was done of preparing the environment for the
introduction of the new technology.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-040#142:1>
These included preparing workers accustomed to manual operations for
the upcoming changes.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-040#143:1>
The department realised that users must adapt to work with the
system and that means extensive change management. <X>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-040#X144:1>
IS professionals must change their way of thinking and behaving,
particularly if the brunt of their experience has been with a mainframe.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-040#X145:1>
The system, installed in 1989, dispatches 74,000 payments a day.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-040#X146:1>
The majority of benefits are distributed through 20,000 post
offices in the form of booklets with six month's worth of cheques that
recipients cash each week.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-040#X147:1>
The new retirement pension system handles 99.5 percent of all cases
automatically and is saving this government an estimated S&dollar;2.5 billion a
year, with an increase in efficiency of more than 20 percent.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-040#X148:1>
Also, error rates on assessments dropped from 10 percent to 2
percent.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-040#X149:1>
THE RISKS Many of the benefits associated with client/server arise
out of new types of applications.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-040#X150:1>
Likewise, many of the risks and costs of client/server arise from
these same sources.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-040#X151:1>
There are several reasons why client/server systems are riskier to
develop.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-040#X152:1>
For one, the development and maintenance of client/server systems
are more complex.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-040#X153:1>
One reason is because client/server applications incorporate GUIs (
Graphical User Interface).

<ICE-SIN:W2B-040#X154:1>
They are very interactive and potentially require more complex
logic than traditional mainframe-style interfaces.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-040#X155:1>
Therefore, the economic benefits of implementing client/server
technology need to be carefully analysed.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-040#X156:1>
It would be foolish indeed to scrap millions of dollars that have
been invested in existing host-based applications without a clear
understanding of the economic benefits.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-040#X157:1>
<h> SOLVING BUSINESS PROBLEMS </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-040#X158:1>
Clearly, client/server is not the antidote for all of today's
business problems.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-040#X159:1>
When applied correctly and for the right reasons, client/server can
help companies address competitive pressures and meet customer needs.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-040#X160:1>
But to deliver potential client/server models must add value to the
organisation.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-040#X161:1>
The key objective is to create as much value as possible from the
technology investment without getting swept away by the technology.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-040#X162:1>
To create value, client/server can help computers become greater
assets by making their roles more active; computers can become more active
participants in the decision making process, rather than act as passive word
processors or number crunchers.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-040#X163:1>
Client/server also brings power to the desk-top - power to make
strategic decisions and strengthen the capability of the workforce.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-040#X164:1>
The key is to look for value that more than pays for the
technology.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-040#X165:1>
The return on investment should be sound before proceeding with
client/server.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-040#X166:1>
Client/server is not the solution to every business problem, but in
the right situation, with a sound investment and a process that is designed
correctly, client/server can help organisations operate and compete more
strategically.
