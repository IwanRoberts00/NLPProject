<I>

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-045#1:1:A>
Thank you for coming down uhm today for taking your time off

<ICE-SIN:S2A-045#2:1:A>
Uh I'd like to actually just start off this talk uh by giving you a
little bit of introduction of our company

<ICE-SIN:S2A-045#3:1:A>
Uhm you may heard of Unilever but not of many them as a matter of
fact would have actually about our organisation

<ICE-SIN:S2A-045#4:1:A>
Unilever but I'm pretty sure that all of you would have heard about
the products that we market and the kind of businesses that we handle in
Singapore

<ICE-SIN:S2A-045#5:1:A>
Uh if I told you that uhm we are the people who actually manufacture
and market products like Lipton Walls Ponds Elizabeth Arden and uh something
like another three hundred and seventy more products you'll be surprised

<ICE-SIN:S2A-045#6:1:A>
In fact uh Unilever is listed in Fortune five hundred as the
twentieth largest company in the world

<ICE-SIN:S2A-045#7:1:A>
We are we were listed as the most profitable consumer products
company in the world by Fortune five hundred and uh that really makes us to a
very large corporation

<ICE-SIN:S2A-045#8:1:A>
Now just to give you a little bit of background about Unilever

<ICE-SIN:S2A-045#9:1:A>
Unilever is actually a huge multi-national that is Anglo-Dutch fifty
per cent owned by London fifty per cent owned by Rotterdam

<ICE-SIN:S2A-045#10:1:A>
Uh in Singapore basically we are a marketing uh operation but we do
have a Lipton tea fac uh tea factory in Singapore

<ICE-SIN:S2A-045#11:1:A>
Uh that's one of the reasons why we have also invited uhm some
people from Mechanical Engineering will be able to ? ? answers of the day

<ICE-SIN:S2A-045#12:1:A>
In fact uh we have been labelled as the tea excellence setter from
this region and you you may be surprised that we are actually supplying
Chinese tea to China okay

<ICE-SIN:S2A-045#13:1:A>
It's a fact and we we have been labelled as the most efficient
production facility in the world by a by an international uh tea-tasting
consulting firm

<ICE-SIN:S2A-045#14:1:A>
And uh that leaves Singapore's uh facility a very small but very
effective operating unit

<ICE-SIN:S2A-045#15:1:A>
We produce something like about three million tea bags a day and uh
we amongst our suppliers as I mentioned includes China Taiwan South Korea
Japan Chile Malaysia Indonesia so on and so forth

<ICE-SIN:S2A-045#16:1:A>
Now in Singapore we are a we are a set up that that is about uh two
hundred employees strong

<ICE-SIN:S2A-045#17:1:A>
Uh we about evenly distributed into well fifty per cent into
manufacturing and fifty per cent into administrative services

<ICE-SIN:S2A-045#18:1:A>
Uh our operations are basically to as I mentioned market about uh
the three hundred odd products that we actually manufacture

<ICE-SIN:S2A-045#19:1:A>
And uh what we what we are basically a marketing driven firm which
is supported by a sales function as well as personnel and commercial function

<ICE-SIN:S2A-045#20:1:A>
Now you may have uh you may have heard about our competitive
competitors uh which uh sometime feature more prominently than ourselves
namely Procter and Gamble and uh Johnson and Johnson and so on and so forth

<ICE-SIN:S2A-045#21:1:A>
Main thing is because they do use their company names behind them
in marketing their products

<ICE-SIN:S2A-045#22:1:A>
But Unilever is a completely different set up because we have got
operations not only in consumer products division but also in chemicals
specialty chemicals uh patients?? and uh several other uh several other I
should say business ventures

<ICE-SIN:S2A-045#23:1:A>
We we we even have finance companies as well as uhm as well as uh
bank a little bit of a little of finance as well as banking operations world
wide where we have gone into joint ventures and we have even moved into uh
information technology

<ICE-SIN:S2A-045#24:1:A>
So actually Unilever is one company which can offer all of you
graduates who'd be coming out next year a pretty good career opportunity as
well as placement

<ICE-SIN:S2A-045#25:1:A>
The reason is because of as far as Unilever is concerned we've got
one of the best human resource policies uh where we actually plan for
people's career advancement three year in advance

<ICE-SIN:S2A-045#26:1:A>
Then we we know exactly how many people we are recruiting over the
next three years how our organisational structure will change over the next
three years taking into consideration of the uhm market considerations

<ICE-SIN:S2A-045#27:1:A>
And we've also know exactly who would be moving up when what sort
of training opportunities we'll be having for each and every employee of ours

<ICE-SIN:S2A-045#28:1:A>
Now just to go into a little bit about training we are we are proud
to say that we are one of the fore forerunners in terms of training in
Singapore

<ICE-SIN:S2A-045#29:1:A>
We also expend something like six per cent of our payroll

<ICE-SIN:S2A-045#30:1:A>
In fact that was that is the latest figure I just I have just fresh
out of the budget meeting

<ICE-SIN:S2A-045#31:1:A>
We have managed to spend something like about six per cent of our
payroll on training on employees in Singapore

<ICE-SIN:S2A-045#32:1:A>
Our training is basically Unilever specific

<ICE-SIN:S2A-045#33:1:A>
The reason is because we have got very structured international
training programmes where what we do is that when we hire you recruits into
our especially management trainees we we we call you new hires as management
trainees

<ICE-SIN:S2A-045#34:1:A>
When we hire management trainees into our company what we do is
that we put them on the job training for about a year

<ICE-SIN:S2A-045#35:1:A>
And right after that we do identity a main core group of management
trainees who we will be willing to invest upon

<ICE-SIN:S2A-045#36:1:A>
And what would happen is that you would be setting up a business
principles' course for that particular group of people uh which exposes them
to all of Unilever functions

<ICE-SIN:S2A-045#37:1:A>
Now this is a regional course it's usually held around this region
uh where it is rotated of course

<ICE-SIN:S2A-045#38:1:A>
After attending this particular business principles' course and we
would we would we would evaluate each and every management trainee right
after this particular business principles' course which is very very uh
vigorous I must say

<ICE-SIN:S2A-045#39:1:A>
It's a tough two-week programme and once we give uh once we
complete it you'll be out for evaluation

<ICE-SIN:S2A-045#40:1:A>
Now if you do well in that particular business principles' course
then we would then go on to arrange for a swop programme for you where you
would be spending six months of your working career in another country

<ICE-SIN:S2A-045#41:1:A>
What we do is that we exchange you for someone else either from the
function or from a different from another country

<ICE-SIN:S2A-045#42:1:A>
Like for instance if we swop you say with Thai Thailand then a
person from Thailand which could be coming down to Singapore take away
position and every for six months

<ICE-SIN:S2A-045#43:1:A>
Basically you'd be on your own you'd be given a budget to manage
and uh you'd be in a completely immersed into a completely different uh
environment as well as a country

<ICE-SIN:S2A-045#44:1:A>
Now you may feel a little bit apprehensive about it but uh actually
this programme is to get people more mature in their working life and
experience

<ICE-SIN:S2A-045#45:1:A>
It's to train people to actually independently handle problems and
uhm get your yourself immerse into the business into a different kind of
environment

<ICE-SIN:S2A-045#46:1:A>
That's the main objective behind this programme after which we
would chart a specific course of career path for you

<ICE-SIN:S2A-045#47:1:A>
And depending on it you you would be attending at least one
regional or professional training training programme every two years

<ICE-SIN:S2A-045#48:1:A>
You can see that Unilever is one company which actually invests
hell of a lot on their employees

<ICE-SIN:S2A-045#49:1:A>
Well as they say nothing is for free right

<ICE-SIN:S2A-045#50:1:A>
Why do we invest so much on our people

<ICE-SIN:S2A-045#51:1:A>
It's because we demand results from the people whom we hire also

<ICE-SIN:S2A-045#52:1:A>
It's because we believe a person cannot be adding on value through
the company without the relevant train training via exposure

<ICE-SIN:S2A-045#53:1:A>
In fact that's one of the reasons why a few years back Unilever set
up its own universities

<ICE-SIN:S2A-045#54:1:A>
We call it the four acres where we we send our top most and the
best employees to be trained in London in Boston or in South America

<ICE-SIN:S2A-045#55:1:A>
We've got three universities all over the world

<ICE-SIN:S2A-045#56:1:A>
It shows the kind of commitment that we have in our people

<ICE-SIN:S2A-045#57:1:A>
Now I'd be uh screening?? you a little bit uh uh uh uh corporate
video that uh we actually have involves the people talking about the uhm
company's practice

<ICE-SIN:S2A-045#58:1:A>
The kind of exposure that they have

<ICE-SIN:S2A-045#59:1:A>
The kind of uh training that they receive and the kind of career
development that we have offered to our uh employees shortly okay

<ICE-SIN:S2A-045#60:1:A>
But before that I would like to also emphasize that when you work
with Unilever you'd have to be internationally mobile not just in the
short-term but in the long-term

<ICE-SIN:S2A-045#61:1:A>
The reason is because we do believe in exposing people all the
around not only this region but also the world

<ICE-SIN:S2A-045#62:1:A>
We have got several regional coordination office always which is
pretty hungry for people

<ICE-SIN:S2A-045#63:1:A>
We're also looking for a lot of people to be placed in China

<ICE-SIN:S2A-045#64:1:A>
There's definitely?? whole exciting market and that's where we're
sending most of our people to

<ICE-SIN:S2A-045#65:1:A>
In fact last year we sent three of our top managers over to China
and this year we'd be sending uh one person over to Mexico

<ICE-SIN:S2A-045#66:1:A>
And we'll to evaluate a few more people to be expatriated to some
other countries

<ICE-SIN:S2A-045#67:1:A>
Okay so we do offer people places overseas but that is provided
that each employee proves himself to be worthy of that sort of investment and
exposure

<ICE-SIN:S2A-045#68:1:A>
Now you may have asked me uh the kinds of career opportunities that
are available within Unilever as of now

<ICE-SIN:S2A-045#69:1:A>
Now as of now as of today I'm not looking for any person but I am I
would definitely be looking for people when at the at or about the time when
you graduate

<ICE-SIN:S2A-045#70:1:A>
That would be sometime in February or March

<ICE-SIN:S2A-045#71:1:A>
As I said we do have a regular programme of expatriating our
employees and when when we expatriate employees we would have opportunities
for local graduates to actually fill up those positions

<ICE-SIN:S2A-045#72:1:A>
And that's when when we would like you to apply to Unilever and the
selection criteria is pretty tough

<ICE-SIN:S2A-045#73:1:A>
Uh I would like I I I would not go into the selection criteria nor
the process in which we actually recruit people because it's uh relatively
confidential but we do have a structured way of recruiting people

<ICE-SIN:S2A-045#74:1:A>
But the kind of people whom we are looking for is number one the
person has to have has to be street smart

<ICE-SIN:S2A-045#75:1:A>
Okay ultimately I was just telling a colleague of mine you know

<ICE-SIN:S2A-045#76:1:A>
In fact in fact in the recent recruitment fair uh lots of people
were asking me this question

<ICE-SIN:S2A-045#77:1:A>
Uh do I have to be a biz ad graduate in order to be recruited to
the marketing department

<ICE-SIN:S2A-045#78:1:A>
Uh the answer to it is no

<ICE-SIN:S2A-045#79:1:A>
In fact half of the marketing department is filled with Physics
graduates

<ICE-SIN:S2A-045#80:1:A>
Okay I'm not I'm not suggesting that you have to be a Physics
graduate to be uh recruited into my marketing department

<ICE-SIN:S2A-045#81:1:A>
But it involves hell of a lot of common sense involves hell of a
lot of number crunching it involves attraction it involves an articulate and
clear thinking personality

<ICE-SIN:S2A-045#82:1:A>
So do it these are the general qualities that we are actually
looking for

<ICE-SIN:S2A-045#83:1:A>
And we are looking for people as I was mentioning in sales
marketing commercial which includes financial and management accounting as
well as I T information technology as well as to run the production facility

<ICE-SIN:S2A-045#84:1:A>
As a management trainee you come in of course you have to be
trained to run production facility

<ICE-SIN:S2A-045#85:1:A>
But ultimately you would be running the factory in Singapore

<ICE-SIN:S2A-045#86:1:A>
So these are the qualities of people calibre of people that we are
looking for when we recruit for management trainees for next year

<ICE-SIN:S2A-045#87:1:A>
Okay now uh what I'll do is that now I I'd play the uh recruitment
video

<ICE-SIN:S2A-045#88:1:A>
Uh it's about fifteen to twenty uh fifteen to eighteen minutes I'm
know that it's about eighteen minutes long

<ICE-SIN:S2A-045#89:1:A>
Okay after which uh I I have a brochures of our my company uh
describing what exactly I have told you as of now <X>

<ICE-SIN:S2A-045#X90:1:A>
And uhm perhaps if you have any questions to ask me after that uh
I'd be more than willing to uh answer you okay </X> </I>
