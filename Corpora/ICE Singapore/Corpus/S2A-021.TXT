Residents of Ulu Pandan and friends we are coming back again to
Ulu Pandan after the last general election

<ICE-SIN:S2A-021#2:1:A>
What do we find

<ICE-SIN:S2A-021#3:1:A>
We find that the PAP is on the defensive this time

<ICE-SIN:S2A-021#4:1:A>
Never before has the PAP been on a defensive in any general election
but they are at this particular point of time

<ICE-SIN:S2A-021#5:1:A>
Why because the SDP has adopted the right strategy

<ICE-SIN:S2A-021#6:1:A>
We have called upon the other opposition parties to field less
candidates so that to make this election a by-election

<ICE-SIN:S2A-021#7:1:A>
We have the by-election effect and as it turned out on Nomination
Day the PAP had 41 uncontested seats and there are 40 seats for the people to
choose their credible opposition from

<ICE-SIN:S2A-021#8:1:A>
So you understand this it is not a step backwards it is not a
retreat on the part of the opposition it is in fact a strategy that we have
adopted and the PAP now has got no answer to it because now they are at the
mercy of the electorate

<ICE-SIN:S2A-021#9:1:A>
The electorate can vote credible opposition at their choice

<ICE-SIN:S2A-021#10:1:A>
What is a by-election what is a by-election

<ICE-SIN:S2A-021#11:1:A>
A by-election is an election when even you vote all the opposition
they can never come to power because there is already a government a
government is already in power that is a by-election

<ICE-SIN:S2A-021#12:1:A>
So once the PAP is in power after having got the 41 seats we
consider the balance of the seats are contested as a by-election

<ICE-SIN:S2A-021#13:1:A>
Now this is our strategy and it is the right strategy as has been
mentioned by Guan Yu Keng

<ICE-SIN:S2A-021#14:1:A>
This Jayakumar and all the other PAP members have trying tried to
dismiss the SDP's strategy but they cannot

<ICE-SIN:S2A-021#15:1:A>
Jayakumar has said what is this that

<ICE-SIN:S2A-021#16:1:A>
This strategy is about he says that the people wants to vote in a
good slate of PAP MP because of this strategy

<ICE-SIN:S2A-021#17:1:A>
Mr Chiam said ask them to vote the opposition and then what happen
if they vote the opposition he says that it would be a vote for the
opposition and it would a vote against the endorsement of Mr Goh Chok Tong

<ICE-SIN:S2A-021#18:1:A>
He says this will send conflicting signals but I do not see it at
all

<ICE-SIN:S2A-021#19:1:A>
I think Mr Jayakumar has got it all wrong himself

<ICE-SIN:S2A-021#20:1:A>
The fact is that since 1984 or maybe earlier the electorate of
Singapore has seen the harsh policies of the PAP

<ICE-SIN:S2A-021#21:1:A>
They have seen how the PAP take money from the people with all
kinds of means they have got a social problem and they use the social problem
to get money out of it

<ICE-SIN:S2A-021#22:1:A>
They have a social problem of car congestion and they thought in
fact they have taken advantage of the car congestion and make plenty of money
out of it you know

<ICE-SIN:S2A-021#23:1:A>
And I know they have got car import tax they have got ARF now we
have got COE we got high registration fee we got parking fee all kinds all
added up

<ICE-SIN:S2A-021#24:1:A>
Not only car owners suffer but of course if we are business people
so the people are quite fed up and they want opposition

<ICE-SIN:S2A-021#25:1:A>
This is what the people want they want opposition but because
opposition for the time being is weak they are not confident

<ICE-SIN:S2A-021#26:1:A>
They don't want to vote the opposition into power but they still
want the PAP to be the government but they want substantial strong opposition
to check the PAP and this is the real feedback from the ground

<ICE-SIN:S2A-021#27:1:A>
It is not that the people want to vote the PAP actually

<ICE-SIN:S2A-021#28:1:A>
They don't want if they can help it

<ICE-SIN:S2A-021#29:1:A>
If there is a good slate of opposition they would throw them out of
office out of the government if there are but that will be another day for us

<ICE-SIN:S2A-021#30:1:A>
So that is the true reading of the ground the people want
opposition substantial opposition

<ICE-SIN:S2A-021#31:1:A>
They want the PAP to be in power and so now we have given what the
people want a by-election

<ICE-SIN:S2A-021#32:1:A>
You can vote as many opposition as possible and when you vote the
opposition it is not a conflicting signal

<ICE-SIN:S2A-021#33:1:A>
This is the correct signal to the PAP

<ICE-SIN:S2A-021#34:1:A>
You have to vote more opposition strong opposition not only to
establish opposition in parliament

<ICE-SIN:S2A-021#35:1:A>
Make opposition part of our political culture not only that but
also an effective an effective hammer over the head of PAP

<ICE-SIN:S2A-021#36:1:A>
If you don't do that what will happen

<ICE-SIN:S2A-021#37:1:A>
You can bet your last dollar after this election prices will sure
to go up

<ICE-SIN:S2A-021#38:1:A>
The PAP now tells you that the issue is Medifund Edusave and
whatever but don't believe a word of it

<ICE-SIN:S2A-021#39:1:A>
You want to ask them what is behind all these issues that is more
important

<ICE-SIN:S2A-021#40:1:A>
It is not the front issues it is what is hidden behind

<ICE-SIN:S2A-021#41:1:A>
They haven't told you that is more important because you remember
in 1988 what were the issues the elected President

<ICE-SIN:S2A-021#42:1:A>
They say only to take care of the reserve and then we have got the
town council

<ICE-SIN:S2A-021#43:1:A>
They said oh if opposition come in the rubbish heap will go two
storeys high all untrue

<ICE-SIN:S2A-021#44:1:A>
Those were the issues but they then did not tell you that in fact
once they get elected with a majority strong mandate the other issues are
hidden behind as price increases

<ICE-SIN:S2A-021#45:1:A>
Mr Ling How Doong our Chairman and candidate at Bukit Gombak now
you know what happen after the 1998 election

<ICE-SIN:S2A-021#46:1:A>
It was only held in September the 1st about not three years yet you
know

<ICE-SIN:S2A-021#47:1:A>
What happened of course immediately after the general election your
HDB car park from 25 to 50 dollars we have got hefty increases in medical and
hospitalisation fees

<ICE-SIN:S2A-021#48:1:A>
So now you better watch out if you get sick you better make sure
you have money in your pocket otherwise you cannot afford to get sick

<ICE-SIN:S2A-021#49:1:A>
You can afford to die but you cannot afford to get sick

<ICE-SIN:S2A-021#50:1:A>
Hefty increases in school fees for independent schools hefty
increases in university fees

<ICE-SIN:S2A-021#51:1:A>
The poor taxi drivers who were always supporters or many of them
were supporters were supporters of the PAP have now got to pay 7007 for their
diesel tax

<ICE-SIN:S2A-021#52:1:A>
Everybody is fond of watching TV your TV license also gone up so
these are the issues which they dare not tell you

<ICE-SIN:S2A-021#53:1:A>
Yes all sorts of taxes not only PUB tax and in the case of the
elected President once the law is made not only the power to veto the use of
reserves but in fact they have got a whole host of other powers

<ICE-SIN:S2A-021#54:1:A>
In fact the elected President has so much powers that when he
really functions I think the Prime Minister will have a tough time in doing
what he wants to do so that is that that is the thing I think all
Singaporeans know of today

<ICE-SIN:S2A-021#55:1:A>
Now what is the main issue in this general election

<ICE-SIN:S2A-021#56:1:A>
The main issue is not giving a resounding mandate to Mr Goh Chok
Tong that has got nothing to do with you

<ICE-SIN:S2A-021#57:1:A>
What is important is this general election is whether you want a
strong opposition in parliament that is the issue

<ICE-SIN:S2A-021#58:1:A>
Remember that and as far as SDP is concerned we don't bother about
what Goh CHok Tong wants

<ICE-SIN:S2A-021#59:1:A>
We not we are not bothered whether you want a big endorsement
whether he wants a strong mandate

<ICE-SIN:S2A-021#60:1:A>
That doesn't not concern you

<ICE-SIN:S2A-021#61:1:A>
How does it benefit you if he gets a 100% mandate

<ICE-SIN:S2A-021#62:1:A>
How does it concern you in fact he will have more power to impose
more taxes

<ICE-SIN:S2A-021#63:1:A>
It does not benefit the people of Singapore at all

<ICE-SIN:S2A-021#64:1:A>
They have already the mandate they have got 41 seats they are in
power so that question is entirely out

<ICE-SIN:S2A-021#65:1:A>
You are not concerned with it at all

<ICE-SIN:S2A-021#66:1:A>
When he talk to you he says that the issue is myself you say you
just forget it don't worry

<ICE-SIN:S2A-021#67:1:A>
The worry the worrying thing is that whether there is strong
opposition in parliament because it is not only for the long-term interest of
Singapore but it is directly for your interest directly for your interest

<ICE-SIN:S2A-021#68:1:A>
The more opposition you have the less the PAP has power on you it
is a direct proportion

<ICE-SIN:S2A-021#69:1:A>
The more power the PAP has the more they can tax on you

<ICE-SIN:S2A-021#70:1:A>
They can do whatever they want in order to get the PAP power down

<ICE-SIN:S2A-021#71:1:A>
You must have a balancing power of more opposition and this is a
very important message and we want the people of Singapore to understand this

<ICE-SIN:S2A-021#72:1:A>
We in the SDP has taken the trouble to reduce our own number of
candidates to make sure that we have a by-election effect

<ICE-SIN:S2A-021#73:1:A>
What happen on Nomination Day if there is 41 opposition candidates
standing for election and PAP 40 we will take the trouble to ask one of our
members to come back down let them have 41

<ICE-SIN:S2A-021#74:1:A>
That is the way how we feel so strongly about our strategy because
now you can vote in the opposition member

<ICE-SIN:S2A-021#75:1:A>
You want to vote for a long time and that is the true feedback we
get and today I'm here to support Mr Ashleigh Seow

<ICE-SIN:S2A-021#76:1:A>
You cannot get a better candidate in Ulu Pandan than Mr Seow he is
a highly qualified man he has got a B.A. honours degree in public
administration from the University of Western Australia

<ICE-SIN:S2A-021#77:1:A>
He has travelled widely he has travelled widely in Australia in
England in Europe and he has got a lot of international exposure

<ICE-SIN:S2A-021#78:1:A>
He is a mature person and not only that he has got the benefit of
hands-on experience not only in running a town council but also in setting up
a town council

<ICE-SIN:S2A-021#79:1:A>
We in Potong Pasir we have a town council which we run ourselves

<ICE-SIN:S2A-021#80:1:A>
We don't neglect our responsibility we do it ourselves all the
responsibility we bear on our shoulders

<ICE-SIN:S2A-021#81:1:A>
We don't chuck it to some professional managing agent to do it for
us like other PAP town councils

<ICE-SIN:S2A-021#82:1:A>
So Mr Seow has seen the setting up of the Potong Pasir town council
before it was formerly come into operation

<ICE-SIN:S2A-021#83:1:A>
We had the ground work laid see that all the paperwork was right we
have to engage staff we have to send the staff for training he has to
organise

<ICE-SIN:S2A-021#84:1:A>
Well that is how he is only known in Potong Pasir so he is the
right man for you because at the town council here he will make sure that it
no only functions well but perhaps functions even better than Potong Pasir

<ICE-SIN:S2A-021#85:1:A>
As you know because we did it ourselves we have a lower cost and we
need not raise the service and conservancy charges

<ICE-SIN:S2A-021#86:1:A>
We did not do it we did it only after 15 months 15 months after the
HDB first raised their service and conservancy charges

<ICE-SIN:S2A-021#87:1:A>
We were able to hold back and 9 months after the 1st PAP town
council raised their service and conservancy charges

<ICE-SIN:S2A-021#88:1:A>
So the issue of the town council now is never brought up by the PAP
because Potong Pasir town council

<ICE-SIN:S2A-021#89:1:A>
The performance at Potong Pasir has silenced them once and for all

<ICE-SIN:S2A-021#90:1:A>
They cannot go around like the 1988 elections threatening people if
you elect an opposition MP he may not be able to run your town council the
rubbish will heap up to the second floor your corridors are not swept the
prices of your flats will fall

<ICE-SIN:S2A-021#91:1:A>
These are all not true because we have proven it at Potong Pasir if
you try to but your flat in Potong Pasir

<ICE-SIN:S2A-021#92:1:A>
You probably have to pay more than in any other including but more
importantly is not just the cleaning and keep the place clean that is with
efficiency of service

<ICE-SIN:S2A-021#93:1:A>
That is probably the easy part

<ICE-SIN:S2A-021#94:1:A>
The most difficult part is how to build it into a community how to
build it into a closely whole and how to get the people at the constituency
to do things for themselves and be proud that we are the people who are
really in charge and not the PAP <X>

<ICE-SIN:S2A-021#X95:1:A>
And we show that we don't need the PAP people can do things
themselves that is the more important function of the town council and we at
Potong Pasir may try to do what we preach we have the town council which are
representatives of the residents there are 4 total or more who are non-SDP
members and therefore our town council unlike the other PAP town councils we
are not political I am the political representative there anytime can be
outvoted because they have the majority I am not worried because I know they
are residents they care for their own town Potong Psir town they care for
their own surroundings they were only to make sure that things are correct
for the town so the issue of town council is never brought out again although
they say that it is explicitly going to be an issue of this election now I
think we have put the PAP on the defensive you can see Goh Chok Tong is
already retreating at first he came out very strongly and say unless I get an
endorsement I may not have the power or the ability to implement Edusave and
Medisave and the people and opposition gets more firm as the people
understand the strategy of the opposition the people understand that they can
vote in more opposition this time Goh Chok Tong he's afraid now you can see
he report in the papers oh no no even if I get a weak endorsement I will
still implement these policies and because of the onslaught of this good
strategy he can't think properly for a Prime Minister what is he saying he
says that in fact it was stated by BG Lee he said that if the opposition wins
40 seats possibility is there a possibility of the win of the opposition win
40 seats then it will be a weak endorsement for the PAP and Goh Chok Tong
goes to say that if the opposition wins 40 seats then it would be not an
endorsement for his leadership and he will step down do you know that Marine
Parade is a contested constituency they have a opposition contesting in
Marine Parade if the PAP lost 40 seats Goh Chok Tong will have lost his seat
he will not be in parliament he will be kicked out he cannot step down he
will be kicked out I'm surprised that Mr Goh can make such a mistake not
realising that his own Marine Parade is contested a contested seat there it
is not a question of if it is the PAP lost 40 seats it is not a question of
not endorsing his leadership in fact they don't want him even to be a member
of parliament now my last duty here is to appeal to all of you residents here
at Ulu Pandan if you are staying in these flats please tell your neighbours
who are not here your relatives your friends your colleagues at your
work-places if you go to the market the store-holders the shopkeepers tell
them all tell them all that this is a by that there is a by-election effect
tell them all to vote in credible opposition wherever you see one you vote
them in and please tell them to vote in the SDP candidate he is a credible
opposition give him a chance to show that he can do better than the PAP
candidate all the time the PAP claim that they are the only good ones but
because the opposition has never given a chance now is the chance for you to
vote Mr Ashleigh Seow as your next member of parliament vote in Ashleigh Seow
make him your next member of parliament I'm very proud to present Ashleigh
Seow to you and I am sure he will make a very good member of parliament you
can see for yourself he is a very sincere man approachable person anytime you
got any problem you just give him a ring and he will come running to you can
you say that of any PAP member of parliament well i suppose Ashleigh Seow is
too big for him to kiss i'm a smaller person yes i appeal to you I urge you
please vote in Ashleigh Seow we have got one member of the opposition in
parliament let us see many many more new faces and when you turn on the TV
parliament tonight you will definitely find it more interesting thank you
very much </X> </I>
