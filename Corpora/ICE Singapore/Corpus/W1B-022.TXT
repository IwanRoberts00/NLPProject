<h> MEDICAL BENEFITS </h>

<ICE-SIN:W1B-022#5:1>
I refer to the medical report in connection with your appointment as
Research Assistant in the Department of English Language and Literature.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-022#6:1>
In view of the medical report, you may wish to note that your medical
benefits under the University's Medical Services Scheme will exclude
treatment of hypertension and its related complications.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-022#7:1>
Apart from this exclusion, normal medical benefits will be granted.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-022#8:1>
I should be grateful if you would acknowledge receipt of this letter.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-022#9:1>

Dear Mr Tan

<ICE-SIN:W1B-022#23:2>
<h> HOSPITALISATION, SURGICAL AND MATERNITY INSURANCE SCHEME - 1993
</h>

<ICE-SIN:W1B-022#24:2>
The University, in its effort to assist staff members on restricted
medical benefits, has negotiated with the Netherlands Insurance Company to
provide a special plan of the Hospitalisation, Surgical and Maternity
Insurance Scheme.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-022#25:2>
The details of the plan are enclosed.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-022#26:2>
Basically, the special plan provides coverage for hospitalisation
expenses related to your restricted medical condition which incidentally will
not be covered by the University in your case.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-022#27:2>
The premium, although slightly higher than the normal plan ( blue
brochure, which was sent to you earlier), is reasonably cheaper than market
rates for similar coverage.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-022#28:2>
If you wish to take up this special plan, we would appreciate if you
could complete and return the application form at Appendix C and form MED
05/93 to me by 24 May 1993.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-022#29:2>
If we do not hear from you by then, we shall assume that you do not
wish to be covered by this special plan.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-022#30:2>
Yours sincerely

Dear Mr Lim,

<ICE-SIN:W1B-022#73:4>
1 I first wrote to you on 18 September 1993 and I received a reply
from Mr Daniel Tan.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-022#74:4>
I then replied to him on 29 October 1993.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-022#75:4>
A copy of the letter is attached here for your reference.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-022#76:4>
2 I received your letter dated 29 November 1993 and to my dismay, I
am again unsuccessful in the 4th Quarter 1993 Booking Programme to purchase a
5-Room flat in Bukit Merah.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-022#77:4>
3 After every booking programme I have become more and more
disillusioned.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-022#78:4>
The hope of owning a bigger flat is becoming more and more like an
impossible pursuit.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-022#79:4>
If you go through your records, you will notice that I have submitted
close to ten applications to purchase a flat and each time I was
unsuccessful.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-022#80:4>
4 I have been notified by you on 28 May ' 93 that I am placed on the
reserve list after being unsuccessful in the 2nd Quarter Booking Programme
for a 4-room flat in Queenstown.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-022#81:4>
To date, I am still anxiously waiting for your reply as to whether
there are balance flats or whether all the flats have been taken up.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-022#82:4>
This time I am again notified that I am placed on the reserve list
for the 4th Quarter Booking Programme.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-022#83:4>
How long will I have to wait to know of the outcome, since I have yet
to be notified about the outcome of the 2nd Quarter Booking Programme?

<ICE-SIN:W1B-022#84:4>
Surely there must be ways to expedite the selection of flats.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-022#85:4>
5 There must be a fairer system to allocate flats to applicants than
the present balloting system as one seems to have to be really lucky to be
successfully allocated a flat.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-022#86:4>
I am utterly disappointed with the HDB as every unsuccessful
application in each quarter implies a loss of additional thousands of dollars
as the price of HDB flats escalate every quarter.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-022#87:4>
I am disgruntled and in my mind I am wondering whether I'll ever get
to upgrade to a bigger flat or has this dream been shattered already.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-022#88:4>
Please reply.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-022#89:4>
Yours sincerely </I>

Dear Mr Tan,

<ICE-SIN:W1B-022#100:5>
Thank you for your letter dated 18 October 1993.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-022#101:5>
2 You have advised me to apply for a flat in non-mature estates such
as Woodlands and Jurong West.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-022#102:5>
If you have gone through my previous applications you will have
noted that I have applied numerous times for a flat even at Yishun and Ang Mo
Kio for the previous few exercises for resale/new flats but was unsuccessful.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-022#103:5>
You have also advised me to consider buying a flat in the open
market.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-022#104:5>
As a Singapore citizen who has spent two-and-a half years serving
the country and who is also liable for reservist, I see no valid reason as to
why I should purchase a flat from the open-market especially when prices of
5-room flats have sky-rocketed over the years and it is almost impossible to
purchase a flat in the open-market.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-022#105:5>
Moreover, I strongly feel that the open-market should only be a
source to enable permanent residents to purchase a flat and not for
Singaporeans who have made sacrifices for their country.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-022#106:5>
3 You have mentioned that there is a high demand for flats in
Queenstown.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-022#107:5>
However, I am very surprised to learn that some friends of mine are
allocated a flat in Queenstown despite being their first attempt and despite
not being a resident of this area.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-022#108:5>
The reason being that they are first-time home owners.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-022#109:5>
Perhaps the HDB should stop giving priority to first-time home
owners in mature estates and set aside these estates for residents residing
there.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-022#110:5>
4 I have submitted an application to buy a 5-room flat in Bukit
Merah in the 4th Quarter 1993 Booking Programme.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-022#111:5>
This is my eighth attempt and I hope that the HDB will seriously
consider my application for the flat.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-022#112:5>
Thank you.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-022#113:5>
Yours sincerely </I>

<ICE-SIN:W1B-022#115:6>
Dear Ms Ng

<ICE-SIN:W1B-022#116:6>
<h> APPLICATION TO PURCHASE AN HDB FLAT </h>

<ICE-SIN:W1B-022#117:6>
We refer to your letter dated 18 Sep 93.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-022#118:6>
2 You may wish to know that the supply of flats for booking is
generally divided into 2 categories: those in non-mature estates such as
Jurong West and Woodlands where land is available for development; and those
in mature estates such as Toa Payoh and Bedok where there is very little land
to build new flats.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-022#119:6>
The demand for flats in mature estates is always very high.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-022#120:6>
Hence, the success rate to be shortlisted to book a flat in the
mature estates is low.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-022#121:6>
3 For mature estates, HDB has from October 1992 implemented the
Residents Priority Scheme ( RPS) under the Booking System.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-022#122:6>
Under this scheme, residents of mature estates who apply for new
flats in their estates are given twice the success rate over non-resident
applicants in the ballot.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-022#123:6>
To be eligible, a resident applicant must be currently either a
lessee, tenant or an authorised occupier in an HDB flat within the estate
applied for and have lived there for at least 5 years at the time of
application.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-022#124:6>
4 We note that you applied for a 4-room flat in Queenstown for the
2nd Quarter 1993 Booking Programme.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-022#125:6>
As you have resided in Queenstown for more than 5 years, your
application was processed under the RPS.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-022#126:6>
However, we wish to explain that the allocation of flats ultimately
depends on the demand and supply of flats in the estate applied for.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-022#127:6>
In the 2nd Quarter 1993, we received a total of 3104 applications
for the 228 units of 4-room flats offered for sale in Queenstown.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-022#128:6>
Of these applications, 1060 were from residents of Queenstown.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-022#129:6>
As demand far exceeded the supply of flats, we regret that you were
not shortlisted to book a flat even though your application was considered
under the RPS.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-022#130:6>
5 You have enquired about the balance flats in Queenstown.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-022#131:6>
As you are placed on the Reserve List, you will be invited to select
a flat based on your queue position in the list should there be any balance
of 4-room flats in Queenstown.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-022#132:6>
We will also inform applicants on the Reserve List if there are no
more balance flats available.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-022#133:6>
6 If you wish to be allocated a flat earlier, we would advise that
you widen your choice of estates and apply for a flat in non-mature estates
such as Jurong West or Woodlands.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-022#134:6>
Since January 1992, HDB has implemented the Revised Balloting Scheme
( RBS) to assist applicants in their applications for flats in non-mature
estates.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-022#135:6>
Under this scheme, applicants who are new households and those who
have submitted earlier applications for flats in non-mature estates each
quarter are accorded priority in the ballot.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-022#136:6>
With RBS, an applicant's chance of being allocated a flat is
enhanced at each subsequent ballot as long as he applies each quarter for a
flat in the non-mature estates.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-022#137:6>
7 If you wish to apply for an HDB flat under the Booking System
again, you will have to submit to us your Application Form together with the
&dollar;10 coupon.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-022#138:6>
The 4th Quarter 1993 Booking Programme is currently open for
applications from 1 Oct 93 to 21 Oct 93.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-022#139:6>
Details on the estates and flat types for booking were published in
the Straits Times and Lianhe Zaobao on 1 Oct 93.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-022#140:6>
8 If you are in urgent need of a flat, you may also consider buying
a resale flat from the open market.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-022#141:6>
The advantage of buying resale flats is that they are ready for
occupation.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-022#142:6>
HDB may assist by granting you a mortgage loan for the purchase of a
resale flat of up to 80% of the market value of the resale flat or 80% of
transacted resale price, whichever is lower.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-022#143:6>
With this enhanced financing, you would have a wider choice of
resale flats that are within your affordability.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-022#144:6>

<ICE-SIN:W1B-022#154:7> Dear Sir,

<ICE-SIN:W1B-022#155:7> I refer to your letter dated 28 May 93.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-022#156:7> From your letter, I have been informed that I have been unsuccessful
in the ballot to buy a 4-room flat in Queenstown Estate in the 2nd Quarter
1993 Booking Programme and have been placed on the reserve list. <X>

<ICE-SIN:W1B-022#X157:7> Since then, I have been waiting anxiously for your reply.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-022#X158:7> This is because we are in genuine need for a bigger flat as our
present 3-room flat is grossly inadequate.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-022#X159:7> I now have to share my bed-room with my twenty-two year old sister
and I appeal to your understanding of this inconvenience.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-022#X160:7> My purpose in writing is to enquire whether there are any balance
flats in Queenstown.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-022#X161:7> In addition, I will like to inform you that I will like to be
considered for a 5-room flat at Queenstown if there is any available.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-022#X162:7> Kindly inform me of the outcome.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-022#X163:7> Your action is deeply appreciated.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-022#X164:7> Please reply.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-022#X165:7> Thank you.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-022#X166:7> Yours faithfully </X> </I>
