<ICE-SIN:S1B-055#X1:1> 13 Mar ' 92 Friday Live from Parliament </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-055#2:1:A>
Mr Chiam

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-055#3:1:B>
Thank you Sir for allowing me to speak

<ICE-SIN:S1B-055#4:1:B>
Sir I'm heartened to hear that the recruitment of teachers have
improved uh to over a thousand last year

<ICE-SIN:S1B-055#5:1:B>
But the Minister uh perhaps could also enlighten us as to the
attrition rate or the drop out rate of teachers from the from their jobs

<ICE-SIN:S1B-055#6:1:B>
Now I'm always concerned in fact every year I bring up this subject
of shortage of teachers in our secondary and primary schools

<ICE-SIN:S1B-055#7:1:B>
Uh when there are not enough teachers to go around the
teacher-student ratio will naturally be low

<ICE-SIN:S1B-055#8:1:B>
How I complain of this many times in this House of the class size in
nearly all government and government-aided schools

<ICE-SIN:S1B-055#9:1:B>
Uh these class size are too large when they are between forty to
forty three and uh pupils in such a class uh can never get effective teaching
in particular in these days when the work load imposed on our school children
is so heavy

<ICE-SIN:S1B-055#10:1:B>
The teachers are given very wide syllabus to cover and they have to
go very quickly through them and of course the average uh pupils uh would
find it very difficult to cope up

<ICE-SIN:S1B-055#11:1:B>
Uh they then they do not do so well in their examinations and their
parents get very worried

<ICE-SIN:S1B-055#12:1:B>
Working mothers are left in a dilemma whether to continue working
or to stay at home stop work and help their children out in their studies

<ICE-SIN:S1B-055#13:1:B>
In the past uh normally only those who can afford will employ
private tutors to coach their children

<ICE-SIN:S1B-055#14:1:B>
but in these days when academic qualifications are so important to
get good jobs even those parents who really cannot afford to have uh tutors
uh tighten their belts make sacrifices and save money to employ tutors to
help out their children in their studies

<ICE-SIN:S1B-055#15:1:B>
So of course this will cause uh greater financial burden on these
parents

<ICE-SIN:S1B-055#16:1:B>
Now and the government wants to encourage learning of mother
tongues in our schools that is something which I support

<ICE-SIN:S1B-055#17:1:B>
Now but the teaching of the standard of teaching of mother tongue
have been dropping in our schools

<ICE-SIN:S1B-055#18:1:B>
Why

<ICE-SIN:S1B-055#19:1:B>
Because there is an acute shortage of teachers and they are too
many pupils in the class

<ICE-SIN:S1B-055#20:1:B>
uh the shortage of teachers is a very basic fundamental flaw in our
schools

<ICE-SIN:S1B-055#21:1:B>
Uh the government says that it's trying hard to solve this uh
problem

<ICE-SIN:S1B-055#22:1:B>
uh in fact I think the government has no choice

<ICE-SIN:S1B-055#23:1:B>
The government should uh sort sort this very uh basic fundamental
basic uh educational uh problem

<ICE-SIN:S1B-055#24:1:B>
Otherwise all the talk about Edusave and the full day schools will
be of little use

<ICE-SIN:S1B-055#25:1:B>
Now last year the Institute of Edu uh last year the Minister said
that the Institute of Education is not producing enough teachers

<ICE-SIN:S1B-055#26:1:B>
uh well I know the Minister is doing everything it can but I hope
this will not be seen as an excuse

<ICE-SIN:S1B-055#27:1:B>
Thank you

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-055#28:1:A>
Mr Low

<ICE-SIN:S1B-055#29:1:A>
You you wanted to speak

<ICE-SIN:S1B-055#30:1:A>
No

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-055#31:1:C>
It's under uh Head L right

<ICE-SIN:S1B-055#32:1:C>
No just now I want to seek some clarification from the Minister

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-055#33:1:A>
Yes you want to seek your clarification

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-055#34:1:C>
Uh what is the turnover uh rate of teachers in the uh uh of
our of the Ministry of Education

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-055#35:1:A>
Dr Tan

<$D> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-055#36:1:D>
Sir just want to seek a clarification from the Senior Minister
of State

<ICE-SIN:S1B-055#37:1:D>
I know there is this policy of not accepting graduates who do not
have two teaching subjects as uh teachers

<ICE-SIN:S1B-055#38:1:D>
I was wondering whether the Ministry has would like to review this
policy because there are I'm sure

<ICE-SIN:S1B-055#39:1:D>
there are some uh graduates who may not have two teaching subjects
for example a graduate in nus history and politics

<ICE-SIN:S1B-055#40:1:D>
Would they consider would the Ministry consider accepting such uh
graduates as teachers

<ICE-SIN:S1B-055#41:1:D>
Thank you

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-055#42:1:A>
Dr Tay

<$E> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-055#43:1:E>
Sir uh turn first to the point made by uh Mr Chiam

<ICE-SIN:S1B-055#44:1:E>
Uh I've already spoken quite uh extensively about the uh
recruitment of teachers to try to meet the shortage situation so I will not
repeat myself

<ICE-SIN:S1B-055#45:1:E>
Uhm his point about class size uh is something that he brings up
almost every year uh predictably

<ICE-SIN:S1B-055#46:1:E>
Mr Chiam has the opinion that uh to have good education you must
keep your class sizes small the smaller the better

<ICE-SIN:S1B-055#47:1:E>
Uh I don't know where he has obtained this uh information from

<ICE-SIN:S1B-055#48:1:E>
I suspect he has obtained it from his western contacts because it
is true in uh UK United States they uh one of the key points that had been
made by many people is they must keep class sizes small the smaller the
better twenty five twenty per class

<ICE-SIN:S1B-055#49:1:E>
But but does Mr Chiam that in these two countries in UK and US
there is a great deal of unhappiness about education

<ICE-SIN:S1B-055#50:1:E>
In fact there's a lot of criticism about the dropping standards of
education in these two countries

<ICE-SIN:S1B-055#51:1:E>
and this is a subject which will affect the elections in Britain in
April and possibly the American elect Presidential election in November

<ICE-SIN:S1B-055#52:1:E>
So I don't think uh he should just simply uh quote or ape something
which has been uh widely touted in another place and say that this is a
solution for Singapore

<ICE-SIN:S1B-055#53:1:E>
It is much more I think this class size issue is over-rated

<ICE-SIN:S1B-055#54:1:E>
If you look at Japan Korea Taiwan their class sizes are bigger than
ours On a regular basis it's between forty five and fifty per class and I
remember visiting a very good school in Seoul Korea

<ICE-SIN:S1B-055#55:1:E>
Their class sizes were sixty per class

<ICE-SIN:S1B-055#56:1:E>
They managed to do quite well

<ICE-SIN:S1B-055#57:1:E>
Their their students in fact excel and are held up by the American
educationists as examples of students who are doing so well and of a system
that is far better than theirs

<ICE-SIN:S1B-055#58:1:E>
I think we should see these things in balance

<ICE-SIN:S1B-055#59:1:E>
We have a class size of about thirty six and it varies from year to
year depending on the uh the number of classes that are created

<ICE-SIN:S1B-055#60:1:E>
It has served us well

<ICE-SIN:S1B-055#61:1:E>
I don't think there has been any uh worry that because of the class
size of thirty six you know our school results are suffering

<ICE-SIN:S1B-055#62:1:E>
In fact each year to the amazement of many people the results seem
to be improving

<ICE-SIN:S1B-055#63:1:E>
This year's 'O' level results and 'A' level results have been the
best ever

<ICE-SIN:S1B-055#64:1:E>
I think what is more important I'm ya are you dealing

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-055#65:1:C>
I don't believe that the class size has nothing to do with the
quality of education

<$E> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-055#66:1:E>
You don't believe it

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-055#67:1:C>
because because if you have a smaller size of class the
teacher will have more attention pay more attention and more time to cater
for individual students

<$E> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-055#68:1:E>
It's it isn't as simple as that my friend

<ICE-SIN:S1B-055#69:1:E>
I was going to come with this next point

<ICE-SIN:S1B-055#70:1:E>
What are what are the key factors for success in school

<ICE-SIN:S1B-055#71:1:E>
Since the Mr Chiam Mr Low are very concerned about this

<ICE-SIN:S1B-055#72:1:E>
What are the key factors of success in school

<ICE-SIN:S1B-055#73:1:E>
I think first the basic ability of the child is very important The
child is endowed with certain abilities that is very basic and important

<ICE-SIN:S1B-055#74:1:E>
Secondly the motivation of the child is important also

<ICE-SIN:S1B-055#75:1:E>
The child may be very bright in terms of his endowment if he is
unmotivated he will not do well he will not pay attention to his studies

<ICE-SIN:S1B-055#76:1:E>
So motivation is important

<ICE-SIN:S1B-055#77:1:E>
What are the what are the avenues of motivating the child

<ICE-SIN:S1B-055#78:1:E>
The school is definitely an important avenue and that's why I said
that the principal and his team of teachers are really the core the heart of
the school

<ICE-SIN:S1B-055#79:1:E>
By doing a good job in running the school they are motivating the
children under their charge concentrate on their lessons to do well in their
ECA to do all kinds of things they want them to do

<ICE-SIN:S1B-055#80:1:E>
But beyond the school motivation by parents is perhaps even more
important

<ICE-SIN:S1B-055#81:1:E>
Let me explain why I say this

<ICE-SIN:S1B-055#82:1:E>
I've just come across a study

<ICE-SIN:S1B-055#83:1:E>
This is a study of children of Vietnamese refugees who are studying
in American schools in California

<ICE-SIN:S1B-055#84:1:E>
To the amazement of everybody these children who speak hardly any
English when they start school are doing very well in their schools in their
neighbourhood schools compared with American children who are not doing well
at all in the schools

<ICE-SIN:S1B-055#85:1:E>
So studies have been done in this

<ICE-SIN:S1B-055#86:1:E>
Why

<ICE-SIN:S1B-055#87:1:E>
The same school different children

<ICE-SIN:S1B-055#88:1:E>
One does well one doesn't do very well

<ICE-SIN:S1B-055#89:1:E>
There must be some other reason

<ICE-SIN:S1B-055#90:1:E>
The reason is outside the school

<ICE-SIN:S1B-055#91:1:E>
They found in their studies that the Vietnamese parents of these
children pay a great deal of attention toward their children

<ICE-SIN:S1B-055#92:1:E>
They may not be highly educated themselves Many of them are in fact
not rich at all

<ICE-SIN:S1B-055#93:1:E>
They are refugees but they pay attention to what their children do

<ICE-SIN:S1B-055#94:1:E>
they encourage them they supervise them where they can and as a
result of that kind of encouragement the children concentrate on their work
and they do well in the American system

<ICE-SIN:S1B-055#95:1:E>
Now what is true of the Vietnamese children is also true of
children in Singapore and anywhere else in the world

<ICE-SIN:S1B-055#96:1:E>
If there is parental interest if there's warmth and encouraging
support from parents even if the parents are not rich even if the parents do
not have a high education but they are interested in what their children are
doing the children will do better in school

<ICE-SIN:S1B-055#97:1:E>
That has been proven again and again from many studies

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-055#98:1:C>
Is the Minister implying that those students who are not doing
well or their parents are not interested

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-055#99:1:A>
Mr Low in future if you have

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-055#100:1:C>
Oh sorry

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-055#101:1:A>
<unclear> word </unclear> to raise could you please ask for
my permission first

<ICE-SIN:S1B-055#102:1:A>
all right

<$E> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-055#103:1:E>
I think the member should take the whole thing in context not
just pick on one point

<ICE-SIN:S1B-055#104:1:E>
On the other hand it is true that there are parents who
unfortunately are very nervous about their children's education

<ICE-SIN:S1B-055#105:1:E>
uh they are negative in the way they deal with their children

<ICE-SIN:S1B-055#106:1:E>
I think this discourages the children

<ICE-SIN:S1B-055#107:1:E>
It shakes up their self-confidence and in fact the children do
worse

<ICE-SIN:S1B-055#108:1:E>
So my advice to parents is to take a positive attitude to be very
encouraging and not to use the opposite which is to scold them to criticise
them and to compare them with other children and say why is it your you can't
do better than them

<ICE-SIN:S1B-055#109:1:E>
I think this discourages the child

<ICE-SIN:S1B-055#110:1:E>
The reason may be to help them to do better but the result is the
opposite

<ICE-SIN:S1B-055#111:1:E>
On a subject of turnover of teachers in our schools

<ICE-SIN:S1B-055#112:1:E>
uhm in fact the turnover rate in our schools is not high

<ICE-SIN:S1B-055#113:1:E>
Uh we have a turnover rate of staff of about two to three percent
a year

<ICE-SIN:S1B-055#114:1:E>
Now if you compare that with the turnover in many other industrial
in uh economic sectors I think the turnover rate of teachers is quite low

<ICE-SIN:S1B-055#115:1:E>
Uh Dr Tan Cheng Bock has asked the question about graduate
teachers or graduates who have who do not have two teaching subjects

<ICE-SIN:S1B-055#116:1:E>
Uh I think I have to refer this to the uh Public Service
Commission or the Education Service Commission because they are responsible
for the recruitment of teachers

<ICE-SIN:S1B-055#117:1:E>
uh and they also lay down the rules on what is minimum requirement

<ICE-SIN:S1B-055#118:1:E>
But the reason why two teaching subjects have been put in for
graduates is because most teachers can be expected to teach two subjects not
just one

<ICE-SIN:S1B-055#119:1:E>
So it's quite necessary for them to have two teaching subjects

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-055#120:1:A>
Yes Mr Chiam

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-055#121:1:B>
Sir can I just one ask one question

<ICE-SIN:S1B-055#122:1:B>
Sir

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-055#123:1:B>
Now I thought you have finished

<ICE-SIN:S1B-055#124:1:B>
Can I ask one question

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-055#125:1:A>
Go ahead Mr Chiam

<ICE-SIN:S1B-055#126:1:A>
Go ahead

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-055#127:1:B>
Just one one one question only

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-055#128:1:A>
Yes go ahead

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-055#129:1:B>
Uh I would ask the Minister assuming that the school under
all conditions are similar and in one school you have got a class size of
twenty five another school with a class size of sixty which school would you
send your child to <X>

<$F> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-055#X130:1:F>
Uh may I just uh supplement uh what uh my Minister of State
Senior Minister of State has said uhm answer to Mr Chiam's question I
understand it's his favourite question and it's uh something worth debating
Now in in looking at the education system we have a tendency in Singapore to
look towards the west US UK and so on and some of the opposition leaders uh
members might have been teachers before so they had certain philosophies
built into them If you have been following the press uh in UK for example
recently they have come up with a new study you know the Education
Secretaries' come up with new study to show that in fact they were for many
years for generations influenced so much by this so-called Powden Report
which says you should never teach a child you should let him discover by
himself you know you should not even have prop uh uh structured learning and
so on As a result of this the education system in UK has been blighted for
generations and now they're trying to recover So you must see this in
perspective if you want to study and try and improve the education system We
must also compare the situation in nuh Japan the situation in nuh Korea
Taiwan and so on And as a let me finish first let me finish first as has been
mentioned by uh Dr Tay in fact the class size in Japan and Taiwan are forty
fifty and even above In Singapore's case our class size standard size is
forty Some schools have less In fact the average figure for secondary schools
is about thirty six pupils per class Now those schools that are less popular
tend to have smaller classes the popular ones tend to have big classes
sometimes as big as forty four and the results are better uh So it is not so
much the class size alone Let's not over-emphasise this point If you want to
uh reduce class size for example you go from forty to twenty as uh advocated
by Mr Chiam you will have to increase number of teachers by two Instead of
twenty thousand teachers you need to have forty thousand teachers Where do we
find the number of teachers And what is the value of so doing I mean if you
teach in front of a class of uh twenty or class of forty what's the
difference You're teaching right Of course if you want to have a interactive
method then it's better to have a smaller class size But you must remember
that sometimes when you interact with the pupils in fact you may be spending
more time with one pupil at the expense of the whole class and that is the
problem that's been discovered in the western system The problem also with
the western system is that the children tend to be very undisciplined While
the teacher is teaching the class would be you know playing basketball behind
or something Our situation is very different Our pupils are very disciplined
and they want to learn and their parents want them to learn So we've
discovered that in fact with a class size of forty we are doing very well and
we should be proud of the results that we've achieving year after year I
think we compare very well with international standards and personally I'm
amazed at number of students who score straight As in 'O' levels uh 'A'
levels and so on </X> </I>
