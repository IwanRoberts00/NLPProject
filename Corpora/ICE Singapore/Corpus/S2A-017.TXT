<I>

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-017#1:1:A>
And a very warm welcome to you to the Toa Payoh Sports Complex
for the start of the fourth day of swimming events here at the Seventh
South-East uh uh the seventeenth South-East Asia Games

<ICE-SIN:S2A-017#2:1:A>
Uh where the <unclear> word </unclear> of Prime Minister Mister Goh
Chok Tong to watch the uh events which everybody is waiting for the fifty
metres freestyle for men

<ICE-SIN:S2A-017#3:1:A>
And we have introduction of swimmers here in lane number five is
Richard Sambera of Indonesia lane

<ICE-SIN:S2A-017#4:1:A>
Number six is Chakasay of Thailand

<ICE-SIN:S2A-017#5:1:A>
Lane seven we Harold Gan and in lane number eight Raymond Papha

<ICE-SIN:S2A-017#6:1:A>
Ang Peng Siong exceeded uh the best swimmer in this uh heats this
morning

<ICE-SIN:S2A-017#7:1:A>
He is in lane number four and he should be expecting a good fight
from lane three Wisneil of Indonesia on his left

<ICE-SIN:S2A-017#8:1:A>
And uh Peng Siong has shaven his head for this event

<ICE-SIN:S2A-017#9:1:A>
This is gonna be a very interesting race

<ICE-SIN:S2A-017#10:1:A>
And off to a very very good start and uh Peng Siong right in the
lead all the way the twenty-five metre mark that's Chia Peng Siong followed
by Richard Sambera and uh and the top of the cream is uh Singapore Harold Gan
out to <unclear> word </unclear> and it's Peng Siong yes that's Peng Siong in
the lead in a time of twenty-three point six seven seconds

<ICE-SIN:S2A-017#11:1:A>
In second position we have Richard Sanbera at twenty-three point
seven three and third position went to uh Wisneil of Indonesia in twenty-four
seconds

<ICE-SIN:S2A-017#12:1:A>
It is a frustrating race here by uh Peng Siong whose time of
twenty-three point six seconds although has <unclear> word </unclear> not
broken his previous record is still good enough for the gold medal and that's
Peng Siong with his shaven head winning the gold medal the only events that
he's swimming and he has won the gold medal and look at how happy he is with
his shaven head

<ICE-SIN:S2A-017#13:1:A>
Ang Peng Siong the old man of swimming here with a round of
applause from our Prime Minister and also Defence Min Minister Doctor Yeo
Ning Hong and the president of the Singapore Amateur Swimming Association
Victor Goh Yong Hong

<ICE-SIN:S2A-017#14:1:A>
And there you have the official result lane number four was Ang
Peng Siong in twenty-three point six seven seconds

<ICE-SIN:S2A-017#15:1:A>
In second position is lane number five Richard Sambera of Indonesia
twenty-three point seven three

<ICE-SIN:S2A-017#16:1:A>
In third position lane number three uh Wisneil of Indonesia in
twenty-four seconds flat

<ICE-SIN:S2A-017#17:1:A>
And let's watch the replay here

<ICE-SIN:S2A-017#18:1:A>
Yes it was a very close race but uh actually Toto in a race like
this you really don't really bother about strategy you just go in and if you
notice I don't think any of the swimmers took a breath at all throughout the
whole race

<ICE-SIN:S2A-017#19:1:A>
Uh they just took a deep breathe at the start and if at all maybe a
breath uh halfway down but I don't think any of the swimmers ever took a
breath right through

<ICE-SIN:S2A-017#20:1:A>
Well this is a a typical Ang Peng Siong race

<ICE-SIN:S2A-017#21:1:A>
Uh Peng Siong always starts off very very strong and uh towards the
end uh he he probably just uh coast <unclear> word </unclear> and uh another
five more metres I think uh Richard would have uh beaten Peng Siong but
nevertheless

<ICE-SIN:S2A-017#22:1:A>
Yes that's not a fifty-five metre race and that's Peng Siong

<ICE-SIN:S2A-017#23:1:A>
This is why Peng Siong doesn't want to swim the hundred metres
because he knows that uh he just doesn't have the uh stamina to carry out
this uh uh uh hundred metre race but fifty metres is still very good for him

<ICE-SIN:S2A-017#24:1:A>
And uh with that we'll cross over for the last five minutes of the
hockey game uhm and we'll come back to the Toa Payoh Swimming Complex later
on </I>


<I>

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-017#25:2:B>
And this the introduction of the swimmers for the two hundred
metres breath stroke the second event this evening

<ICE-SIN:S2A-017#26:2:B>
We've just introduced Joselin Yeo in lane number one and in lane
number two we have Sita of Thailand

<ICE-SIN:S2A-017#27:2:B>
Now Joscelin uh qualified seventh in in the heats this morning
that's why she's in lane number one

<ICE-SIN:S2A-017#28:2:B>
And uh I don't know uh what her strategy is and I hope uh she
should win another medal for Singapore

<ICE-SIN:S2A-017#29:2:B>
Nevertheless that's an introduction there and lane number five we
have Duyuen Ti Pong uh followed by the second Duyuen Ti Pong from Vietnam and
this is lane number six Buwicks Buwickshit of Thailand in lane number six

<ICE-SIN:S2A-017#30:2:B>
And that's May Ooi of Singapore in lane number seven and in lane
number eight we have Rita Mariani of Indonesia

<ICE-SIN:S2A-017#31:2:B>
Now although Joscelin is in lane number one she will be at the
bottom of your screen

<ICE-SIN:S2A-017#32:2:B>
Uh watch out for her because uh we really don't know anything can
happen

<ICE-SIN:S2A-017#33:2:B>
It's the uh one of the slower lanes on the outside but uh well
there's four lengths of the pool to go and uh we're expected something from
Joscelin

<ICE-SIN:S2A-017#34:2:B>
Over to you Toto

<ICE-SIN:S2A-017#35:2:B>
I don't know it's really fabulous uh the effort by Joscelin but I
wondering while you were giving the commentary let me add the qualifying
times uh from the heats this morning

<ICE-SIN:S2A-017#36:2:B>
You know Joscelin almost didn't make it

<ICE-SIN:S2A-017#37:2:B>
She qualified seventh like I said her time during the heats this
morning was two minutes fifty-three point three one and Rita Mariani
qualified last with two minutes fifty-three point six one

<ICE-SIN:S2A-017#38:2:B>
If Joscelin had just slowed down uh by a tenth or two-tenth of a
second she would have been out of the finals

<ICE-SIN:S2A-017#39:2:B>
But uh nevertheless uh Joscelin swimming in lane number one winning
her sixth gold medal

<ICE-SIN:S2A-017#40:2:B>
I think it's May Ooi uh in sorry it's it's Rita Mariani in third
place Rita Mariani in third place

<ICE-SIN:S2A-017#41:2:B>
Uhm there's Joscelin in lane number one

<ICE-SIN:S2A-017#42:2:B>
She's extremely strong last five metres as she lunges towards the
wall and it's a new record time by the way two minutes thirty-four point
eight seven seconds

<ICE-SIN:S2A-017#43:2:B>
And uh Toto this is a typical commentator's nightmare when you have
swimmers so far apart coming in so close together

<ICE-SIN:S2A-017#44:2:B>
Right it's very hard for us to spot them and to call them out but
nevertheless uh uh the important thing is Joscelin has won and what a night
it is for Singapore

<ICE-SIN:S2A-017#45:2:B>
The first two event and we've got two goals already tonight

<ICE-SIN:S2A-017#46:2:B>
First by Ang Peng Siong second by Joscelin Yeo and uh we are gonna
have a replay now of the last hundred

<ICE-SIN:S2A-017#47:2:B>
Yes that's uh

<ICE-SIN:S2A-017#48:2:B>
One fifteen point six one in the first hundred metres by Joscelin

<ICE-SIN:S2A-017#49:2:B>
You know Toto we've got great swimmers uh all these years but
nothing nobody has come close to Joscelin because she's really an all-rounded
you know she swims all the strokes very very well

<ICE-SIN:S2A-017#50:2:B>
Uh we were talking about Junie Sng Junie was very good in in the
front corner <unclear> word </unclear> of free-style

<ICE-SIN:S2A-017#51:2:B>
She was good in the butterfly but uh

<ICE-SIN:S2A-017#52:2:B>
And and that was it but uh look look uh look at this uh even Pat
Chan in those days

<ICE-SIN:S2A-017#53:2:B>
Pat was a a very good uh free stylist but I don't think Pat uh
maybe where if she hears us at the studio well she she fancied swim that
breast stroke because it's it's not an easy event to swim and here you have a
truly all-rounded uh Joscelin Yeo

<ICE-SIN:S2A-017#54:2:B>
She swims every uh stroke just as well and coming in towards the
last five metres of this replay she wins the two hundred metres breast stroke
for women

<ICE-SIN:S2A-017#55:2:B>
And there you have the results and uh let's hear from our sponsors
</I>


<I>

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-017#56:3:C>
And once again another penalty corner this time conceded by
Florence as she obstructed the Indonesian danger girl Johanna

<ICE-SIN:S2A-017#57:3:C>
With just over ten minutes left Singapore still lead by that
solitary goal scored just before half-time by Delima Isa

<ICE-SIN:S2A-017#58:3:C>
But that goal is under pressure now from the Indonesians

<ICE-SIN:S2A-017#59:3:C>
It wasn't a clean stop and number eleven of Singapore Ong Kim Choo
managed to clear the ball away

<ICE-SIN:S2A-017#60:3:C>
That was the third time she's broken up a a Indonesian short corner

<ICE-SIN:S2A-017#61:3:C>
Here's Johanna

<ICE-SIN:S2A-017#62:3:C>
Dina trying to squeeze her way through

<ICE-SIN:S2A-017#63:3:C>
She manages to win a long corner

<ICE-SIN:S2A-017#64:3:C>
That wall was lifted into the dee

<ICE-SIN:S2A-017#65:3:C>
Florence good play by Florence

<ICE-SIN:S2A-017#66:3:C>
She didn't actually make contact with the ball but she forced Dina
into playing a bad pass

<ICE-SIN:S2A-017#67:3:C>
Hit out by Florence once again

<ICE-SIN:S2A-017#68:3:C>
She's looking into clear range

<ICE-SIN:S2A-017#69:3:C>
She couldn't the stick Johanna was actually obstructing her

<ICE-SIN:S2A-017#70:3:C>
That ball lifted into the dee so that should be a sixteen yard hit
for Singapore and they would be well-advised to take their time on this one

<ICE-SIN:S2A-017#71:3:C>
She finds Dahlia

<ICE-SIN:S2A-017#72:3:C>
Dahlia will send it long to

<ICE-SIN:S2A-017#73:3:C>
Melanie was trying to get free but Indonesian they pick her up well

<ICE-SIN:S2A-017#74:3:C>
Siew Keng well stopped by Siew Keng

<ICE-SIN:S2A-017#75:3:C>
She found Geraldine who tried to flick it to Melanie

<ICE-SIN:S2A-017#76:3:C>
Siew Keng once again they're still trying to play up Melanie the
the Indonesian girls packed the dee right there and Singapore wasn't able to
find the way through

<ICE-SIN:S2A-017#77:3:C>
Well cut out by Dawn Defol

<ICE-SIN:S2A-017#78:3:C>
That allows the Singapore girls time to get back

<ICE-SIN:S2A-017#79:3:C>
But I can see a few tired women out there

<ICE-SIN:S2A-017#80:3:C>
There's not much help from the frontline coming back to assist the
mid-field

<ICE-SIN:S2A-017#81:3:C>
Geraldine played in to Dahlia

<ICE-SIN:S2A-017#82:3:C>
And held <unclear> word </unclear> it up given it Melanie

<ICE-SIN:S2A-017#83:3:C>
Melanie is trying to free Delima

<ICE-SIN:S2A-017#84:3:C>
The ball has foul <unclear> word </unclear> its way through

<ICE-SIN:S2A-017#85:3:C>
Swee Keng short ball to Delima

<ICE-SIN:S2A-017#86:3:C>
Delima's round her man or a woman I should

<ICE-SIN:S2A-017#87:3:C>
Looking for a good cross

<ICE-SIN:S2A-017#88:3:C>
Well cut-out by the Indonesians

<ICE-SIN:S2A-017#89:3:C>
A chance there

<ICE-SIN:S2A-017#90:3:C>
The ball didn't run right for Dahlia

<ICE-SIN:S2A-017#91:3:C>
Very good run by Delima

<ICE-SIN:S2A-017#92:3:C>
That cross caused quite a bit of panic and confusion in the
Indonesian defence

<ICE-SIN:S2A-017#93:3:C>
The ball did right run right for Dahli though and Swee Keng Melanie
<unclear> word </unclear>

<ICE-SIN:S2A-017#94:3:C>
Well played by the goalkeeper

<ICE-SIN:S2A-017#95:3:C>
Geraldine another chance and somehow the Indonesians managed to
scramble that one way

<ICE-SIN:S2A-017#96:3:C>
Well read by Dawn

<ICE-SIN:S2A-017#97:3:C>
Played forward <unclear> word </unclear> to Melanie

<ICE-SIN:S2A-017#98:3:C>
Dahlia trying to free Geraldine inside the dee

<ICE-SIN:S2A-017#99:3:C>
There was obstruction so we're gonna see another short corner here
for Singapore

<ICE-SIN:S2A-017#100:3:C>
And there's Geraldine Ho the player who won the shot

<ICE-SIN:S2A-017#101:3:C>
Donna is now going to play the ball back

<ICE-SIN:S2A-017#102:3:C>
Dahlia is set to stop it

<ICE-SIN:S2A-017#103:3:C>
Let's see what Singapore have up their sleeve this time

<ICE-SIN:S2A-017#104:3:C>
A bit over elaborate there the Indonesian girls were off the line
quickly and Singapore have lost the chance to pair that one goal advantage

<ICE-SIN:S2A-017#105:3:C>
Long ball played out here

<ICE-SIN:S2A-017#106:3:C>
Geraldine she stopped it well

<ICE-SIN:S2A-017#107:3:C>
And this time I see Dahlia doing her best to get into the box but
Geraldine's reverse flick did make contact

<ICE-SIN:S2A-017#108:3:C>
Ball still with Singapore though

<ICE-SIN:S2A-017#109:3:C>
That looks like obstruction yes it was

<ICE-SIN:S2A-017#110:3:C>
It's obstruction

<ICE-SIN:S2A-017#111:3:C>
Oh that was a very poor ball

<ICE-SIN:S2A-017#112:3:C>
Easily cut out by <unclear> word </unclear>

<ICE-SIN:S2A-017#113:3:C>
With just about five minutes left and the score is still Singapore
one Indonesia nil

<ICE-SIN:S2A-017#114:3:C>
Both sides have their chances in this second half but neither has
been able to score so the solitary goal scored just before half time by
Dalima Hither still <unclear> word </unclear> the difference these two teams

<ICE-SIN:S2A-017#115:3:C>
Ball played to Melanie Martin and Singapore has a chance

<ICE-SIN:S2A-017#116:3:C>
That ball was a bit too soft by Melanie

<ICE-SIN:S2A-017#117:3:C>
Well played by Geraldine

<ICE-SIN:S2A-017#118:3:C>
She went a long way back there but she was dispossess lifting the
ball into the dee

<ICE-SIN:S2A-017#119:3:C>
The Indonesians have been let down by that particular infringement
on many occasions

<ICE-SIN:S2A-017#120:3:C>
They've had a lot of possession but that final pass has been
called lifted into the dee on many occasions

<ICE-SIN:S2A-017#121:3:C>
Melanie good cut back she overran in

<ICE-SIN:S2A-017#122:3:C>
Not having one of her best games Melanie Martin's

<ICE-SIN:S2A-017#123:3:C>
With her skill and class nobody doubts

<ICE-SIN:S2A-017#124:3:C>
There's still just under five minutes

<ICE-SIN:S2A-017#125:3:C>
Well played by Swee Keng

<ICE-SIN:S2A-017#126:3:C>
But I think Singapore were very very lucky there <X>

<ICE-SIN:S2A-017#X127:3:C>
One of the girls seem to me had almost trap the ball with her
body That could easily have been a penalty stroke but the umpire has given
the short corner

<ICE-SIN:S2A-017#X128:3:C>
Well charged down so that should be a long corner

<ICE-SIN:S2A-017#X129:3:C>
And Singapore Singapore breaking out and we are just gonna cut
away to give the give you back to the studio who's gonna show you the victory
ceremony for Ang Peng Siong </X> </I>
