<h> Long queues at cineplex despite computer system </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2C-015#3:1>
TICKET queues at cinemas are supposed to move faster with a new
computerised system, but not at some when blockbusters are being shown, it
seems.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-015#4:1>
Patrons may still have to deal with long, slow-moving queues at some
cinemas when such movies are screened.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-015#5:1>
The long queues spotted snaking out of the cinema lobby at Changi
cineplex last Sunday during the screening of Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story, are
a case in point.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-015#6:1>
The computerised system has been in use at the cineplex since last
month.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-015#7:1>
When contacted, a spokesman for the Shaw Organisation, which runs
Changi cineplex, said: 'There was a long queue because of the movie's
popularity." He added: " We have experienced such long queues when popular
movies were screened in the past." However, he declined to comment when asked
why the computerised system, which cinema operators said would cut waiting
times for tickets, has not helped.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-015#8:1>
The cineplex, which has three cinema halls, has only two ticket
booths.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-015#9:1>
Patrons can buy both current and advance tickets for a movie shown at
any of the halls from either booth.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-015#10:1>
They are also given a choice of seats.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-015#11:1>
Some patrons interviewed felt that this was the reason why queues
were still long.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-015#12:1>
Said housewife K Y Ong, 34: " If the cinema operators want to adopt
such a system where everybody queues at the same place to buy tickets for
different movies, they should not let patrons choose their seats as it slows
the whole process down." Student Alicia Lee, 18, felt that the system was
unfair to patrons who wanted to see the less popular movies.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-015#13:1>
" The cinema should have separate queues for the different movies
being screened," she said.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-015#14:1>
" It is very unfair that I have to deal with a long and slow queue
just because another movie that I don't want to see is very popular." Some
other cinema organisations interviewed agreed.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-015#15:1>
An Eng Wah Organisation spokesman pointed out that Changi's system
made it confusing for the ticket-sellers.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-015#16:1>
" They will have to switch screens all the time for the different
shows, which makes it even more time-consuming," she said.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-015#17:1>
" It defeats the purpose of computerising."

<ICE-SIN:W2C-015#18:1>
Eng Wah has not computerised its ticketing system yet as it is still
looking for the best way to do so.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-015#19:1>
A Cathay Organisation spokesman said another reason for the
cineplex's problem may be that there are only two ticketing booths for three
cinema halls, but added:

<ICE-SIN:W2C-015#20:1>
" Shaw only started the computerised system not too long ago and is
still in the midst of testing the system so these may just be teething
problems.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-015#21:1>
We have to give it some time." </I>

<h> Women are bigger, going by their bras </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2C-015#23:2>

<ICE-SIN:W2C-015#24:2>
SINGAPOREAN women have become more developed over the past few years
- in the bust, that is, said brassiere manufacturers here.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-015#25:2>
And younger women are wearing bigger bras at an earlier age too, said
lingerie manufacturer Triumph International, which has phased out the
smallest AA cup from BeeDees, its teenage bra range.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-015#26:2>
It checked the schoolgirls' bust sizes at several schools last year
and measured girls between the ages of 11 and 18 at the yearly talks it gives
at these schools.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-015#27:2>
Triumph International, which has nearly 70 per cent of the market
share of the lingerie industry here, found that girls are wearing bigger bra
sizes at younger ages.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-015#28:2>
Miss Ginny Goh, a Triumph International spokesman, said it will
introduce bras with C cups in their young range here soon.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-015#29:2>
The letters A, B and C refer to the size of cups, of which A is the
smallest.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-015#30:2>
The AA cup was started for girls who had not developed enough to wear
an A cup bra comfortably.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-015#31:2>
Bra sizes 28, 32, 34, 36 correspond to a woman's chest frame measured
in inches.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-015#32:2>
Sales figures also show a trend towards bigger bras.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-015#33:2>
" Our best-selling bra size is now 34 B compared with four years ago,
when it was 34A," said Miss Goh.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-015#34:2>
" There are even women buying more C and D size cups." Spokesmen for
other lingerie brands, including Wacoal Singapore, St Michael's and Vanity
Fair, agreed with Triumph's observations.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-015#35:2>
Mr Thomas Lam, 48, spokesman for Japanese bra manufacturer Wacoal
Singapore said: " Over the past 10 years the market share for size 32 bras
has slipped 12 per cent while that for size 36 for example, gained 11 per
cent."

<ICE-SIN:W2C-015#36:2>
He noted that when converted into actual quantities, the percentages
indicate a decrease and increase of thousands of bras.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-015#37:2>
Wacoal's market share for A cup bras dropped by 9 per cent and that
of B cups rose by 7 per cent - both over the past five years.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-015#38:2>
" This indicates that Singaporean women are not only getting
bigger-built but better-developed too," said Mr Lam.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-015#39:2>
When contacted, two Ministry of Health nutritionists said the
findings could be attributed to better nutritional intake in recent years.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-015#40:2>
Said Dr Mabel Yap, deputy director of the ministry's Food and
Nutrition Department, " Our studies show that children and adolescents today
are bigger-sized and taller than those 10 to 20 years ago."

<ICE-SIN:W2C-015#41:2>
She said children today would develop faster and earlier as their
nutritional intake improved with better quality food and increased emphasis
on good dietary habits.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-015#42:2>
" As Singapore becomes more affluent, children will mature even
faster because of better food and environment during their growing years."

<h> Breast reconstruction throws in a tummy tuck </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2C-015#45:3>
By Cheryl Tan

<ICE-SIN:W2C-015#46:3>
NOW you can get a new breast and a tummy tuck at the same time
through a new procedure at the Singapore General Hospital ( SGH).

<ICE-SIN:W2C-015#47:3>
Doctors can now more reconstruct a more realistic new breast for
women undergoing a mastectomy with flesh from her lower abdomen.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-015#48:3>
The result?

<ICE-SIN:W2C-015#49:3>
A softer and more well-shaped breast which has no chance of
rup-turing - unlike breasts created with implants.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-015#50:3>
" There are many ways of reconstructing breasts using either silicone
or saline implants, or even using tissue from backs but this, so far, is the
best," said Dr Leslie Kuek, 36, a consultant plastic surgeon at SGH.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-015#51:3>
" Other methods may be equally feasible but they all have their
problems " he said.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-015#52:3>
Silicone and saline implants could rupture or even harden due to the
body's reaction to it, and a woman's back might not provide adequate flesh
for a proper breast.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-015#53:3>
This new procedure using fatty tissue and muscle from the abdomen,
called the Free Flap operation, has been made available in SGH since July
1991.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-015#54:3>
But only 11 women have gone through it so far.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-015#55:3>
It was introduced after Dr Kuek studied the procedure in Japan for a
year.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-015#56:3>
He felt that Singaporean women should be able to opt for such an
operation.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-015#57:3>
He said: " Previously when a woman had breast cancer, she was
condemned to wearing stuffed bras.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-015#58:3>
" It is important that such women be given a solution to mastectomy
which makes them feel more normal." The Free Flap operation involves the
removal of fatty tissue and muscle from a flap opened at the lower abdomen.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-015#59:3>
Such tissue is then inserted through a slit near the armpit to form a
breast.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-015#60:3>
There will of course be scars, but Dr Kuek said they will fade with
time.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-015#61:3>
The procedure was first developed in 1979.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-015#62:3>
The one used at present is the improved version of the Transverse
Rectus Abdominis Myocutaneous ( Tram) Flap in use here for the past eight to
10 years.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-015#63:3>
This is a similar transplant of a flap of tissue from the lower
abdomen except that the tissue cannot be moulded into shape.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-015#64:3>
" It is important that the tissue can be moulded as the breast we
create must match the other natural one exactly in shape and size," he said.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-015#65:3>
To perfect the look, a nipple can be created by pinching skin
together or by transplanting half of the woman's remaining nipple, if ample
enough, onto the new breast.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-015#66:3>
But Dr Kuek warned that the procedure cannot be used for women with
flat abdomens as there would not be enough tissue to transplant.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-015#67:3>
The operation costs about
&dollar;8,000 when done with a mastectomy, and
&dollar;5,800 when done alone.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-015#68:3>
It increases the operating time for a mastectomy from about 1 1/2
hours to six or seven hours.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-015#69:3>
Despite this, Dr Kuek advises that patients have both operations done
simultaneously.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-015#70:3>
" It reduces the psychological trauma of the mastectomy," he
explained.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-015#71:3>
" At least women will wake up from the operation with two breasts,
not one." He stressed that there was minimal risk due to the present level of
expertise in anaesthesia.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-015#72:3>
But the selection process for patients is still quite stringent.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-015#73:3>
" We select the stronger and younger patients who can better cope
with the strenuous operation," he said.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-015#74:3>
Patients also have to spend at least eight days in hospital
recovering.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-015#75:3>
But patients who have undergone the operation feel that it is worth
it, with some even experiencing sensation in their new breasts which,
technically, could not happen as the nerves are not re-attached.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-015#76:3>
Those interviewed said the operation made them feel like normal women
again.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-015#77:3>
Said a 54 year-old clerk who did not want to be named: " My new
breast is exactly the same shape and size as my old one and matches my other
breast perfectly.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-015#78:3>
" The best part is, I emerged from it with a flatter tummy." How the
free flap procedure works

<ICE-SIN:W2C-015#79:3>
A piece of tissue and muscle is cut from the lower abdomen

<ICE-SIN:W2C-015#80:3>
An artery and vein are detached along with muscle, so that the new
breast continues to be living tissue

<ICE-SIN:W2C-015#81:3>
A flap of fatty tissue and muscle is removed from lower abdomen after
detaching blood supply.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-015#82:3>
The flap is folded to achieve the desired breast shape.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-015#83:3>
The flap is inserted into the chest wall.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-015#84:3>
The blood vessels are rejoined using an operating microscope.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-015#85:3>
A new nipple is created when all wounds have healed.

<h> Michael Jackson fans booking Amex priority tickets jam up phone
lines </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2C-015#87:3>
By Cheryl Tan

<ICE-SIN:W2C-015#88:3>
MICHAEL Jackson fans yesterday jammed fax and phone lines for
American Express priority tickets to his concert, while a few teenagers began
queueing for discounted tickets from as early as 2 am, although tickets went
on sale only at 11 am.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-015#89:3>
Several irate Amex cardmembers who tried unsuccessfully to get
through the whole day called The Straits Times to complain.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-015#90:3>
The priority offer, which began yesterday and will run until July 15,
is part of Amex's Applause programme and entertainment booking service
exclusively for cardmembers.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-015#91:3>
The total number of 90,000 tickets is available to Amex cardmembers
but the two promoters, Lushington Entertainment and Sunvic Productions, say
that they will ensure that there will be tickets left for non-cardmembers.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-015#92:3>
Applause allows cardmembers to book an unlimited amount of
&dollar;200 and
&dollar;125 tickets by just calling or faxing in their orders.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-015#93:3>
Those who want
&dollar;65 tickets have to book them personally at the Singapore Indoor Stadium.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-015#94:3>
A handling charge of
&dollar;3 for the first 20 tickets and an additional
&dollar;3 for every additional 20 tickets is levied.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-015#95:3>
Non-cardmembers can buy their tickets only from July 16.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-015#96:3>
When contacted about the phone jam, a spokesman for ticketing system
Sistic confirmed that the response to Amex's offer was overwhelming, but
declined to say how many tickets were sold.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-015#97:3>
He said: " The phones were ringing non-stop the whole day - nothing
like the normal response we get while handling bookings for other shows." He
also declined comment when asked if Sistic was thinking of adding more phone
lines to facilitate faster booking.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-015#98:3>
Several callers to The Straits Times who were not cardmembers felt
that allowing American Express cardholders to book an unlimited amount of
tickets was unfair.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-015#99:3>
Some said it might even encourage black-market dealings.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-015#100:3>
However, Amex spokesman Mrs Helen Rauff said that it had offered
similar booking privileges for other popular shows like David Copperfield,
but had not experienced any problems.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-015#101:3>
She maintained that the system was not unfair, saying: " Cardmembers
could be booking large numbers of tickets for their family friends or staff
who are non-cardmembers and cannot book them otherwise." <X>

<ICE-SIN:W2C-015#X102:3>
Amex cardmembers were not the only ones who had a chance to get
tickets before other Singaporeans, however.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-015#X103:3>
Teenagers staked out the Hard Rock Cafe from as early as 2 am
yesterday to get the 880 discounted tickets for front-row seats specially
reserved for those between the ages of 12 and 18.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-015#X104:3>
According to a spokesman for the show's promoters, the first six
rows for both Michael Jackson's shows on Aug 29 and 30 - were reserved for
youths at the request of the superstar, who has an affinity for children.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-015#X105:3>
All 880 tickets were sold out by 5.30 pm.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-015#X106:3>
The spokesman said an enthusiastic response from teenagers was
expected, but the eagerness of three who started camping outside Hard Rock
Cafe from 2 am and bought tickets for both nights was not anticipated.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-015#X107:3>
Said one of them, 18-year-old student Vivien Chong: " We came just
as the night crowd at Hard Rock was leaving, so they must have thought we
were pretty crazy." " We were plagued by mosquitoes the whole night and
almost got dragged into a brawl with about 20 drunken men across the street
but it was all worth it."

<ICE-SIN:W2C-015#X108:3>
She added: " Seeing Michael Jackson is something that we have
dreamt of for the past five years." </X> </I>
