<h> Hobby of Collecting Phonecards </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2D-017#3:1>
CARTELEGERY is a term used for telephone-card collecting.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-017#4:1>
In this age of information technology, more and more countries are
developing their telecommunication networks and switching from the
traditional payphone system to a cashless system.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-017#5:1>
More and more varieties of designs in phonecards will emerge, thus
providing phonecard collectors with a wealth of new materials to choose from.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-017#6:1>
In Singapore, the Singapore Telecom has so far issued many interesting
and attractive phonecards which have caused strong enthusiasm in the
collecting of Singapore phonecards.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-017#7:1>
Although it is a relatively new hobby in comparison with coin
collecting and stamp collecting, it is a very popular hobby amongst people of
all walks of life.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-017#8:1>
Phonecards can be collected in used or mint conditions.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-017#9:1>
In the case of used Singapore phonecards, a collector may, for
example, collects those with one punch-mark ( local term used is " FINE
USED").

<ICE-SIN:W2D-017#10:1>
With the increasing number of phonecards having an array of
attractive designs, and the problem of certain phonecards having limited
issue, a collector may turn to thematic collecting.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-017#11:1>
Although a collector can collect Singapore or Malaysia phonecards by
type having a single design or pictorial view, there is an area of collection
that he can advance to and that is, collecting phonecards with various series
numbers ( eg 5SIGA) in the control numbers on the reverse side of the
phonecards having a single design or view.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-017#12:1>
Unless one has followed the issue from the start, he may not be able
to obtain the early issue in mint condition unless he is willing to pay a
high price for it.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-017#13:1>
We may then go for the used one which will be cheaper and easier to
find.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-017#14:1>
A serious collector may go further and collect phonecards of various
varieties and errors which the manufacturer is unconscious of.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-017#15:1>
The collecting of peripherals in Singapore has gained interest
amongst many local collectors.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-017#16:1>
Some examples of the peripherals are

<ICE-SIN:W2D-017#17:1>
( a) the plastic and paper wallets in which the Anritsu phonecards
and the complimentary
&dollar;1 student phonecards are supplied in respectively.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-017#18:1>
There are 2 varieties of the Anritsu plastic wallets, one having the
printed telephone facing left and the other facing right.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-017#19:1>
( b) the Anritsu instruction sheets which when folded up, are of
phonecard size.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-017#20:1>
There are four different types to collect.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-017#21:1>
Whatever the reason may be, one can tailor his collection to suit his
budget, interest and the availability of the phonecards.

<h> Attractively Designed </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2D-017#25:2>
Phonecards come in many attractive designs and can be bought from
neighbourhood sundry shops as well as large, retail chains.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-017#26:2>
A few companies have also used phonecards as promotional giveaways.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-017#27:2>
You can get a
&dollar;2 phonecard free if you buy one of Mobil's car servicing packages.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-017#28:2>
NEC gave away phonecards to its special visitors at the recent
Singapore 2000 exhibition.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-017#29:2>
NTUC Income, Sharp and Paris Miki are some of the other companies who
use phonecards as promotional giveaways.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-017#30:2>
As the popularity and demand for low denomination cards increases,
companies have used these cards to place advertisements.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-017#31:2>
Of the 29 designs available, 20 of these carry advertisements and
messages from various companies.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-017#32:2>
<h> A Collector's Item </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2D-017#33:2>
The attractiveness and unique designs on phonecards have made them
collector's items.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-017#34:2>
Mr Dennis Lim, a lecturer from a local polytechnic, is one such
enthusiast.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-017#35:2>
He started collecting phonecards in 1985 when he was a student in the
United Kingdom.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-017#36:2>
When he had to make long-distance calls home, Mr Lim found that it
was so much easier to use a phonecard than to grapple with coins.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-017#37:2>
The used phonecards became the start of his collection and today, he
has hundreds of phonecards from Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore and the United
Kingdom.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-017#38:2>
To widen his collection, Mr Lim buys the lowest denomination cards
from Singapore and exchanges them with collectors.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-017#39:2>
New additions to his collection are also acquired from overseas.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-017#40:2>
Mr Lim, who also collects coin, said that there are not many
phonecard collectors in Singapore.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-017#41:2>
However, this hobby will pick up and in a few years, collecting
phonecards may be a favourite pastime with many, like stamp or coin
collecting.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-017#42:2>
This is already happening in countries such as Japan where there are
thousands of designs of phonecards and a tereka ( telephone card) collecting
mania has sprung up, mostly among high-school students.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-017#43:2>
A highly-prized phonecard can sometimes be traded between collectors
for nearly 60 times its face value.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-017#44:2>
<h> Phonecard Exhibition </h> In Paris this year, an exhibition was
held for the first time for phonecard enthusiasts to display their
collection.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-017#45:2>
A phonecard issued by French Telecom with a face value of only a few
dollars was auctioned for
&dollar;6,000 during this exhibition.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-017#46:2>
Another card signed by the former French Minister of Post and Telecom
fetched S&dollar;4,300.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-017#47:2>
This could spur many to take up this hobby as phonecards, like coins,
stamps and other collectibles, can appreciate in value with time.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-017#48:2>
However, for now, most of us are contented with the practical uses of
the phonecard.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-017#49:2>
Like the many cards that we carry in our wallet these days, the
phonecard will probably be one which we will not want to leave home without.

<h> First Phonecard Display </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2D-017#52:3>
Cardphones were first introduced in Singapore in 1985.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-017#53:3>
With the issue of new and attrac1ive phonecards over the years,
phonecard collecting has become a remarkably popular hobby in Singapore.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-017#54:3>
Last month, the 185 designs of phonecards produced by Singapore
Telecom since 1985 were exhibited for the first time.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-017#55:3>
The exhibition, organised by Singapore Telecom and held at its
headquarters in Comcentre, attracted collectors of all ages.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-017#56:3>
In opening the exhibition, Mr Wong Hung Khim, President and CEO of
Singapore Telecom said th'at there are more than 1,000 serious phonecard
collectors in Singapore.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-017#57:3>
This number is growing steadily, as can be seen in the queues,
particularly when phonecards with new designs go on sale.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-017#58:3>
Last December, Singapore Telecom set up a Phonecard Collectors' Club
to cater to the special needs of collectors and to make it more convenient
for them to obtain new issues.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-017#59:3>
The club today has more than 300 members.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-017#60:3>
They automatically receive all new issues, without having to queue
for them.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-017#61:3>
Each club member is also assigned a special serial number which will
appear on all phonecards issued to the member.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-017#62:3>
Today, phonecards produced by Singapore Telecom fall into several
categories.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-017#63:3>
Standard cards issued by Singapore Telecom are known as 'definitives'.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-017#64:3>
These are used for a period of time and reprinted when required.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-017#65:3>
Singapore Telecom also issues 'commemorative cards' for special
occasions.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-017#66:3>
These are available in limited quantities.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-017#67:3>
Of the 185 designs that were exhibited last month, 148 of these were 'advertiser
cards', produced by companies as an advertising and promotional medium.

<h> New Favourable Collection Item </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2D-017#79:5>
<h> More And More People Collect Phonecards </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2D-017#80:5>
The attractiveness and unique designs on phonecards have not only had
their practical value, but also their collection value.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-017#81:5>
More and more people collect phonecards nowadays and some have even
suggested to form a phonecard club.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-017#82:5>
Phonecard is a product of the age of informotion technology of the
twentieth century.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-017#83:5>
Phonecards have gradually become a new favourable collection item
besides numismatic and philatelic items.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-017#84:5>
Singapore Telecoms launched its experimental phonecard service in
1985.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-017#85:5>
Some collectors had since then started collecting phonecards.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-017#86:5>
The first generation phonecards ( Anritsu phonecards) which have the
same thickness as the present MRT stored value cards are of simple and plain
design in red and white colours.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-017#87:5>
A full-scale launching of the phonecard service was made in January
1989.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-017#88:5>
New generation of phonecards ( manufactured by GEC-Plessey
Telecommunicatons Ltd) are not only thicker but also with a characteristic of
colourful design.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-017#89:5>
There are to-date 33 different designs issued by the Singapore
Telecom, of which 22 designs are advertisement type and the remaining 11
designs are definitive issues by Singapore Telecom.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-017#90:5>
Mr Wong Hon Sum, 51 year old businessman with more than 40 years af
collecting experience said that he realized 5 years ago that phonecard has
its collection potential.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-017#91:5>
He had seen the craziness in collecting phonecards when he was in
Japan in 1985.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-017#92:5>
Since then he has started his collection.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-017#93:5>
However, the unattractiveness design of the Anritsu phonecards had
been discarded after use in the early days.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-017#94:5>
With his abundant experience, Mr Wong also said that he knew that
Telephone cards would be one of the collectors item, as experience tells him
that where something is being thrown away, the quantity of the item would be
getting lesser and lesser and eventually, it would become a valuable
collection item.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-017#95:5>
Time has proven his soothsay.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-017#96:5>
The experimental Anritsu phonecards are now difficult to acquire.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-017#97:5>
With the rapid technological advancement nowadays, there are
different systems developed in the phonecards technology.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-017#98:5>
For example, France uses RAA chip in the phonecords which is very
different from Singapore phonecards.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-017#99:5>
Mr Lim Chor Pee said that phonecard symbolizes the prosperity of the
society, and the pace in the advancement of information technology.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-017#100:5>
You will not only see the change in design philosophy but also the
advancement of technology.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-017#101:5>
He is a 39 year old professional who commented that collecting
phonecards is o new hobby for the nineteen eighties and nineties.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-017#102:5>
He started his collection five years ago when he was a student in
England and he has hundreds of them now.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-017#103:5>
Nr Ng Ko; Chin, 55 years old, who has 12 years experience in
collecting philatelic items also started his collection 5 years old.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-017#104:5>
He said that it is human nature to collect something.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-017#105:5>
With no exception, he started his collection when phonecards were
just introduced by Singapore Telecom.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-017#106:5>
Mr.Lim also said that when you collect phonecards you will enjoy the
hobby and that you will get to know more friends.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-017#107:5>
This will help you to widen your social circle.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-017#108:5>
It is just like playing a game.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-017#109:5>
It is a meaningful hobby and a healthy social activity.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-017#111:6>
<h> Mistake In Phone Card </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2D-017#112:6>
One of the four phone cards issued recently by Singapore Telecom to
celebrate the Lunar New Year has been printed with a wrong Chinese character.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-017#113:6>
This is believed to be the first incident of its kind, the Chinese
newspaper Lianhe Zaobao reported today.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-017#114:6>
The four cards link up to form one single motif with a dancing lion
and dragon.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-017#115:6>
On one of them, a
&dollar;20-card, is the word " Spring".

<ICE-SIN:W2D-017#116:6>
The lower half of the Chinese word " spring" ( " chun") is a " re" (
meaning" sun").

<ICE-SIN:W2D-017#117:6>
But it has been written with an extra stroke changing it into " mu"
( which means " eye").

<ICE-SIN:W2D-017#118:6>
A calligrapher, Mr Chen Hang, told the newspaper it was " a definite
mistake".

<ICE-SIN:W2D-017#119:6>
" Even if it was to be accepted as a form of ancient writing, the "
re" cannot be written as " mu", Mr Chen said.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-017#120:6>
A Telecom spokesman said it has not received any complaints so far,
but investigations are underway.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-017#121:6>
He said it is quite impossible to recall the cards now.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-017#122:6>
Telecom is not sure how many have been sold.

 <h> Now, A-Lat-Card For Phone Users </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2D-017#125:7>
 LAT, Malaysia's premier cartoonist, is one up on Superman. <X>

<ICE-SIN:W2D-017#X126:7>
 He has been slipping in and out of telephones lately.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-017#X127:7>
 Not phone booths like the cape crusader but the very instruments
themselves.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-017#X128:7>
 Actually, it is his alter ego, the tousled hair kampung boy who is
a central character in his immensely popular cartoons depicting life in
Malaysia, that has been doing all the work.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-017#X129:7>
 That character and others have been roped in to help sell
UniphoneKads, the phone card for Malaysian telephones.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-017#X130:7>
 Four different illustrations from the 40-year old cartoonist's
Scenes of Malaysian Life series were selected for printing on the M&dollar;10 (
S&dollar;6.50) phone cards.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-017#X131:7>
 They were advertised this week.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-017#X132:7>
 The new vehicle for the former journalist's cartoons highlight the
appeal of his creations.
