Dear Mr Tay

<h> APPLICATION FOR ADDITIONAL COMPLIMENTARY TICKETS </h>

<ICE-SIN:W1B-026#7:1>
The 1st Inter-Tertiary Cultural Festival will be launched on the 15th
September 1993 at Harbour Pavilion.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-026#8:1>
3000 tickets for the show have already been printed.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-026#9:1>
We understand that 10% of this number are allowed to be given away as
complimentary tickets.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-026#10:1>
Due to the fact that the festival is a joint effort by nine
institutions ( NUS, Singapore Polytechnic, Temasek Polytechnic, Ngee Ann
Polytechnic, NTU, La Salle, Nanyang Polytechnic, NIE & NAFA) we would like to
apply for permission to give away a total of 1000 complimentary tickets so as
to accommodate all the V.l.P.s from all participating institutions.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-026#11:1>
Attached is a sample of the complimentary ticket.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-026#12:1>
Please call me at 772-6341 should you have any queries.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-026#13:1>
Thank you for your assistance.

Dear sir / Mdm,

<ICE-SIN:W1B-026#19:2>
<h> 1st INTER-TERTIARY CULTURAL FESTIVAL 1993 </h>

<ICE-SIN:W1B-026#20:2>
The Centre for the Arts, National University of Singapore is pleased
to inform you that it has raised sufficient funds to cover a major part of
the costs for the whole festival.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-026#21:2>
This includes the grand opening show henceforth known as The Festival
Launch, the Art Exhibition, Seminar and Closing Ceremony.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-026#22:2>
As such all participating institutions only have to cover the
production costs of their own items for The Festival Launch, their respective
campus opening shows and travelling shows.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-026#23:2>
To assist all institutions in raising funds for these activities, we
suggest that each institution apply to the National Arts Council for project
grants.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-026#24:2>
We have included a set of application forms which should be completed
and returned to the NAC by 31 July 1993.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-026#25:2>
If you should decide to take up this suggestion, please send us a
copy of your application for our reference.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-026#26:2>
Thank you and good luck.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-026#27:2>

<ICE-SIN:W1B-026#31:2>
A second salary when you're sick?

<ICE-SIN:W1B-026#32:2>
Ensure it now, for 10% less than usual, and we guarantee to give you
25% back every year that you stay out of the hospital. </I>

<ICE-SIN:W1B-026#33:3>
Dear Customer,

<ICE-SIN:W1B-026#34:3>
August 1993

<ICE-SIN:W1B-026#35:3>
Right now, the only thing I know about you is that you often pop into
the better department stores in the Orchard Road belt.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-026#36:3>
As such, I think I can safely assume that, this being Singapore, you
know the value of a dollar.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-026#37:3>
And of course, you'd know a good deal when you see one.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-026#38:3>
That's why I'm writing to you today.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-026#39:3>
To introduce you to a product I'm convinced you'll find really
useful.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-026#40:3>
It's called the FamilyCare Hospital Income Plan.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-026#41:3>
This plan is special in that, unlike other policies, it pays you.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-026#42:3>
It pays out generously if you have to go to the hospital because of
an illness or accident.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-026#43:3>
It pays back a 25% no-claim bonus every year if you don't.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-026#44:3>
It means you can always claim at least
&dollar;350 a week, cash in hand, if you have to go to the hospital for a short
stay.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-026#45:3>
And if you're there for more than thirty days, it doubles!

<ICE-SIN:W1B-026#46:3>
Which means that from
&dollar;50 a day, it goes to
&dollar;100. 

<ICE-SIN:W1B-026#47:3>
( That's
&dollar;700 a week, or a very handy
&dollar;2,800 a month.) And if, by any unfortunate chance, you need intensive care,
the whole thing doubles again and you could claim up to
&dollar;143,000. 

<ICE-SIN:W1B-026#48:3>
In other words, this plan guarantees to pay out for two
solid years.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-026#49:3>
For 730 days.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-026#50:3>
In addition to any other insurance policies.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-026#51:3>
And it doesn't even matter which type of hospital; government,
private, or overseas.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-026#52:3>
If you're laid up, it pays out.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-026#53:3>
And, best of all, if you don't make a claim, you get a 25% no-claim
bonus every year.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-026#54:3>
A cheque in the mail.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-026#55:3>
Guaranteed.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-026#56:3>
For more details, please take a look at the enclosed brochure.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-026#57:3>
I think you'll agree that for only 33 cents a day, it's well worth
it.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-026#58:3>
It pays real money, big bucks, when you need it most, to spend in any
way you like.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-026#59:3>
Okay, I know it's hard to get excited about insurance.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-026#60:3>
And tougher still to imagine yourself lying in the hospital with your
MediShield, Medisave and employer's insurance running out.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-026#61:3>
And everyday, hospital costs are going up and up.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-026#62:3>
And what about your family?

<ICE-SIN:W1B-026#63:3>
While you're hospitalised, they will be facing real money worries
like how they'll pay the PUB bills, the grocery bills, the tuition fees and
all the rest of it.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-026#64:3>
But now you know about FamilyCare.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-026#65:3>
Which automatically makes you one of the lucky ones.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-026#66:3>
For just a few cents a day, you can make sure you'll never be caught
saying, " If only I'd known, I'd have got that extra cover..." It could make
all the difference.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-026#67:3>
And then, there's money back if you don't need it.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-026#68:3>
You'll win both ways.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-026#69:3>
What's more, if you enrol now with the enclosed business reply
folder, you'll see we're offering a 10% discount for a short period.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-026#70:3>
Do hurry.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-026#71:3>
Make sure you're properly covered, in sickness and in health.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-026#72:3>
Please, do it now.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-026#73:3>
Yours sincerely,

but the offer expires on 24 September 1993.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-026#139:6>
It was a pleasure to see so many of you at the first FASS-EAI
consultation on 25 October last year.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-026#140:6>
Not a few colleagues have given me valuable suggestions, for which I
am most grateful.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-026#141:6>
I was away for much of November and December.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-026#142:6>
Now I can devote more time to working on the Faculty's East Asian
Research Initiative.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-026#143:6>
One of the things that I intend to do is to keep you informed of
developments relating to East Asian research.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-026#144:6>
1) I am pleased to report that the Centre for Advanced Studies,
Department of Chinese Studies, Department of History, and the East Asian
Institute will be working together in bringing the 9th International
Conference on the History of Science in East Asia to Singapore, in August
1999.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-026#145:6>
While details have yet to be worked out, all parties concerned agree
that " history" is to be understood in a broad sense.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-026#146:6>
A topic such as " science and technology policy in East Asia" would
certainly be appropriate.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-026#147:6>
Colleagues from the Social Sciences are encouraged to participate;
indeed, we plan to invite colleagues from the Science, Engineering, and
Medicine faculties as well.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-026#148:6>
Do let me know if you are interested in forming a panel.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-026#149:6>
Any suggestion, in fact, would be welcome.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-026#150:6>
2) It's time to think about possible research projects that we may
put together.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-026#151:6>
The next round of competition will take place towards the end of
February.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-026#152:6>
Presently there are a number of projects-for which research money
has been given - dealing with such areas as Chinese business history and
Chinese philosophy.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-026#153:6>
Some of the new research areas in which colleagues have expressed an
interest include Japanese popular culture and East Asian drama.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-026#154:6>
I would be pleased to discuss the research grant application process
with you.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-026#155:6>
In fact, I would be contacting you individually to see if the
Deanery can in any way facilitate your research.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-026#156:6>
While individual projects should be encouraged, it would be useful
also to consider pooling our resources to undertake larger multi-disciplinary
projects.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-026#157:6>
3) If you know of colleagues who are interested in our East Asian
Research Initiative, but who are not on our mailing list, please bring this
update to their attention.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-026#158:6>
Please also let me know of your own research.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-026#159:6>
I am working towards a directory of East Asianists in the Faculty.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-026#160:6>

<ICE-SIN:W1B-026#173:7> The 9th International Conference on Chinese Linguistics - Dr Ho Chee
Lick, Dr Bao Zhi Ming, Dr Ni Yi Bin

<ICE-SIN:W1B-026#174:7> In 1992 our University hosted a conference that was to be the
inaugural meeting of a series of conferences under the name of 'The
International Conference on Chinese Linguistics'.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-026#175:7> The conferences between 1993 to 1998 were held at the following
countries or areas: Paris, Hong Kong, USA ( Wisconsin-Madison), Taiwan,
Holland ( Leiden), and USA ( Stanford).

<ICE-SIN:W1B-026#176:7> Next year it will be held in Australia ( Melbourne).

<ICE-SIN:W1B-026#177:7> The conference in Singapore ( held at York Hotel) was opened by the
then Deputy Prime Minister, Mr. Ong Teng Cheong, and was attended by some 320
participants; about half of them were from overseas.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-026#178:7> It was organised under the auspices of the Centre for Advanced
Studies.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-026#179:7> The Organising Committee consisted of three staff members from the
English Dept ( Drs Tony Hung, Ho Chee Lick, Loke Kit Ken), one from the
Chinese Dept ( Dr Lee Cher Leng), and one from the then CLRC ( myself),
serving as the chairman.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-026#180:7> Now I have obtained the Vice-Chancellor's approval for organising
the 9th Conference at the turn of the millennium, the year 2000, again under
the auspices of the Centre for Advanced Studies.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-026#181:7> In this connection, I would like to invite three of your staff
members who have been working on Chinese linguistics to join the Organising
Committee. <X>

<ICE-SIN:W1B-026#X182:7> I am writing for your permission for me to do so.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-026#X183:7> They are: Dr Ho Chee Lick, Dr Bao Zhi Ming, and Dr Ni Yi Bin.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-026#X184:7> Your kind assistance on this matter will be much appreciated.
