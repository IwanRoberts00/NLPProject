<ICE-SIN:W1B-024#151:9> Dear Cardmember

<ICE-SIN:W1B-024#152:9> May 1993

<ICE-SIN:W1B-024#153:9> From now till 31st July 1993, charge up to S&dollar;50 on your Standard
Chartered VISA or MasterCard and you could be flying Swissair to Europe's
prime holiday destination, SWITZERLAND, where you'll enjoy a three-night stay
at each of the alpine resorts of LUCERNE, ST MORITZ and ZERMATT.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-024#154:9> This prize holiday comes easily, without any additional expenses or
effort on your part.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-024#155:9> Unlike other travel programmes, your Swiss holiday is fully paid
for.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-024#156:9> In addition to the double return Swissair tickets and free
accommodation for two at all three resorts, you'll receive a pair of
complimentary Swiss Travel Passes which gives you access to the extensive
network of luxury postal coaches, boat cruises as well as the world famous
Swiss Federal Railway.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-024#157:9> And to top it all, you'll have S&dollar;1,000 worth of spending money
credited to your Standard Chartered VISA or MasterCard account.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-024#158:9> Remember, the next time you charge to your Standard Chartered VISA
or MasterCard, you'll be increasing your chances of travelling to Switzerland
in true Swiss style with Swissair.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-024#159:9> With every accumulation of S&dollar;50 charged, you'll receive one chance
for the Draw.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-024#160:9> Just as Swissair has the reputation for excellence, you can expect
the best with your Standard Chartered Credit Card.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-024#161:9> See the brochure for the details on the " Standard Chartered Swiss
Holiday" Draw.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-024#162:9> It's my pleasure serving you.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-024#193:11> April 1993

<ICE-SIN:W1B-024#194:11> Not too long ago, I sent you some information about the Disability
Protector Plan.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-024#195:11> It's an accident disability plan that pays up to
&dollar;400,000 lump sum cash if you become disabled in the event of an accident.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-024#196:11> It increases 10% in value every year, for ten consecutive years.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-024#197:11> So your policy will be worth up to
&dollar;800,000 in ten years' time.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-024#198:11> At no extra cost!

<ICE-SIN:W1B-024#199:11> The Disability Protector Plan is yours for just 98 cents a day, and
it's guaranteed never to increase.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-024#200:11> You can use the cash for specialist treatment, physiotherapy, or to
secure your loved ones' future.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-024#201:11> What's more, you will receive up to
&dollar;200 cash for each day you're hospitalised because of an accident.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-024#202:11> For a maximum of 730 days that's
&dollar;146,000 cash!

<ICE-SIN:W1B-024#203:11> You can include your spouse in this policy too.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-024#204:11> Just take a look at the brochure I've enclosed for more details.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-024#205:11> The Disability Protector Plan is arranged by Sedgwick Chartered
