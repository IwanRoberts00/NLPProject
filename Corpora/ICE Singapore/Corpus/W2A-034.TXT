<h> Introduction </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-034#7:1>
In the past, much attention has been paid to factory and process
automation to improve the productivity of the blue collar workers.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-034#8:1>
It is essential at this moment, to focus our attention on the
information-intensive manufacturing office activities.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-034#9:1>
Though investments in word processing software have improved the
efficiency of white collar workers, they have also accelerated the paper
creation trend.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-034#10:1>
Nearly 95% of manufacturing engineers use paper, pencil, copiers,
scissors, etc.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-034#11:1>
to create and revise their documents.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-034#12:1>
The communication channel between departments are often clogged with
process sheets, tool lists, drawings and gaging and machining
instructions[l].

<ICE-SIN:W2A-034#13:1>
Creating, revising, and improving manufacturing documents are costly
and time consuming.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-034#14:1>
In addition, lost and misfiled documents are very common.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-034#15:1>
The mundane task of storing documents has become problematical and
space is at a premium.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-034#16:1>
So, there is a need to develop shop documentation programs to solve
the above problem.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-034#17:1>
It will save 50% of the time to create and 90% of the time to revise
the manufacturing documents [ l].

<ICE-SIN:W2A-034#18:1>
It will also bring down the cost of document storage and retrieval to
25%.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-034#19:1>
The integration of the enterprise-wise documentation, will help in
achieving the concept of Computer Integrated Manufacturing ( CIM).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-034#20:1>
Kuniko Inoue, in her article in Look Japan[2], brought out the need
for managing information from market surveys, production processes and
delivery.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-034#21:1>
She adds, " It is imperative that the connection between sales and
manufacturing activities are consolidated.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-034#22:1>
A major issue is how to accumulate and maintain a production
knowledge system".

<ICE-SIN:W2A-034#23:1>
A network-based Manufacturing Document Management System ( MDMS) is
thus proposed for the manufacturing sector.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-034#24:1>
This system will integrate functions such as design, production,
sales and procurement.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-034#25:1>
For example, today individual engineers generate drawings on CAD, but
circulate them by hand/mail.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-034#26:1>
This process can be made more efficient using MDMS.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-034#27:1>
CIM can be defined as a system to integrate manufacturing
technologies by means of Information Technology ( IT).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-034#28:1>
So, CIM will be the plant's communication capacity.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-034#29:1>
This product is designed with this philosophy to strive for a CIM
environment.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-034#30:1>
<h> 2 What is EDM? </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-034#31:1>
Electronic Document Management ( EDM) is a giant step in the
automation of information processing.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-034#32:1>
EDM can be defined as, " The application of information technology to
manage the flow of paper-based information.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-034#33:1>
EDM provides facilities for storing, accessing and retrieving
documents in the electronic form." It is a synergy of a number of information
technologies such as, Document Image Processing ( DIP), workflow, data
processing, office automation, document understanding and intelligent
retrieval.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-034#34:1>
The key is DIP, the technology to convert the paper-based
information into the electronic counterpart.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-034#35:1>
The result is an environment whereby information from a variety of
sources is completely automated and integrated.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-034#36:1>
To address the diversified of requirements, the EDM system spans a
wide variety of sizes, complexity and cost ranging from standalone PCs to
large ( mini or main frame based) systems [ 3,4].

<ICE-SIN:W2A-034#37:1>
Manufacturing Document Management System Computer-Aided Acquisition
and Logistics Support ( CALS), a major US Department of Defence and Industry
programme is attempting to automate and manage the large volume of technical
information required to support a weapon system throughout its life cycle.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-034#38:1>
The standards being developed for CALS are based on existing and
emerging national and international standards for interchange of text and
graphics, and for database definition and access [ 5].

<ICE-SIN:W2A-034#39:1>
The CALS initiative will provide a good frame work for the proposed
MDMS.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-034#40:1>
Manufacturing document Management system ( MDMS) will be an EDM,
tailored to meet the needs of the manufacturing sector.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-034#41:1>
The proposed architecture is presented in figure 1.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-034#42:1>
The system captures different information types ( data, text, image,
graphic, video and voice) and distributes to the users.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-034#43:1>
There will be a provision to modify/edit the document before the
distribution.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-034#44:1>
Figure 2 is a typical MDMS, running on LANs or WANs.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-034#45:1>
Networking strategy will allow for the easy and staged incorporation
of this advanced technology into an existing base of information systems.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-034#46:1>
It will be an open environment where industrial standards and non
proprietary technologies are utilised.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-034#47:1>
UNIX will be the primary operating system, with the support for DOS
and MS-Windows.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-034#48:1>
MDMS will be designed to manage multimedia information which
includes, text, drawings, images and spread sheets.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-034#49:1>
MDMS will provide a unified environment for the management and
routing of these diverse forms of information.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-034#50:1>
In addition, the system will support existing software such as
graphic and text editors to process graphics and text.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-034#51:1>
<h> 3.1 Distributed System </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-034#52:1>
One of the most significant trends in computing today is the move
towards distributed processing via what is known as the client-server model.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-034#53:1>
This architecture is proposed for MDMS, as presently most of the
factories have standalone PCs or workstations.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-034#54:1>
These individual resources could be linked up using LAN for
communication and sharing of resources.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-034#55:1>
Client-server computing will extend the value of distributed
processing to the desktop by splitting an application into a front-end client
application that resides on the end user's workstation and a 'back-end'
server component that runs on computing resources anywhere in the corporate
network.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-034#56:1>
The client presents and manipulates data while server stores,
retrieves and protects data.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-034#57:1>
So in future, networked PCs accessing powerful server based
applications in a distributed processing environment will allow the user to
gain access to databases, mails, communication and document management
services from the desktop.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-034#58:1>
The emergence of fax and ISDN will enhance the acceptance of MDMS.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-034#59:1>
3.2 Creation Scanning ( or digitizing) the information, in the form
of photographs, drawings and pictures, using optical scanners is the first
step to create the electronic documents from paper documents.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-034#60:1>
Available products with bi-level digitization capabilities at
resolutions of 200-400 dots per inch and speeds of 3-10 pages per minute,
will be sufficient for this application.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-034#61:1>
The system will be able to scan different types and varying sizes of
documents.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-034#62:1>
It will have facilities for creating new forms like, a work-order
form, a process routing form, a fixture form, and a quality inspection form.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-034#63:1>
It can be interfaced with other systems such as bills of materials
systems, popular word-processing, text editing, desktop-publishing, and
graphics CAD/CAM/CAE software packages.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-034#64:1>
It will be integrated with the terminal products, and other systems
containing the source information.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-034#65:1>
3.3 Image Processing An image editor, developed at Information
Technology Institute ( ITI) for Document Image Processing can be adapted for
MDMS [ 6].

<ICE-SIN:W2A-034#66:1>
An A4 sheet scanned at 300 dots per inch(dpi) black and white
requires 1.2 MBytes for storage.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-034#67:1>
So the images captured have to be converted or compressed to another
form for efficient storage.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-034#68:1>
The two methods for conversion are, 1.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-034#69:1>
Convert raster to ASCII by Optical Character Readers ( OCR).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-034#70:1>
This is a very efficient method as an ASCII file consumes only about
3 to 5% of the disk space used by an image.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-034#71:1>
With omnifont OCR systems, a vast majority of typed information on
several fonts can be converted.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-034#72:1>
However, error rates are still high and they are useful for
conversion only to a limited extent.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-034#73:1>
2.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-034#74:1>
Vectorisation: Vector data treats an image as a series of points and
geometric figures such as lines, circles or arcs.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-034#75:1>
This process of converting raster data into vector data is suitable
for images containing line drawings, flow diagrams and circuit diagrams.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-034#76:1>
Most of the documents that are not suitable for conversion by the
above methods are compressed as per a two dimensional coding scheme,
complying with international standards like CCITT G4 for interchangeability.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-034#77:1>
The document file format used in the image editor was Tag Image File
Format ( l l), which is a de facto standard.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-034#78:1>
This is useful when transmitting the images through fax gateways.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-034#79:1>
Editing functions provided include cut, paste, copy, move, crop,
delete, scale and rotate ( refer figure 3).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-034#80:1>
<h> 3.4 Database </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-034#81:1>
The electronic documents can be efficiently indexed and retrieved by
relational DBMS's and SQL queries.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-034#82:1>
Network-based client-server DBMSs will be sufficient for this.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-034#83:1>
The manufacturing documents can be identified with a part or drawing
number as the main index or combined with other indices like work order
number.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-034#84:1>
It will also allow remote users to copy a document or make changes
without corrupting the originals.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-034#85:1>
3.5 Storage The multimedia information will be stored in optical
disks on juke boxes.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-034#86:1>
A single 12 inches optical disk can store as much as 50000 A4 images
using suitable compression algorithms.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-034#87:1>
A juke box uses robotic technology for mounting and dismounting
optical disks allowing quick online access to several million images.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-034#88:1>
3.6 User Interface User interface will consist of icons and pull down
menus.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-034#89:1>
It will use windows as a consistent interface across desktop
technologies, applications, and operating environments.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-034#90:1>
The documents will be displayed using relatively inexpensive high
resolution monitors ( 1000 x 1000 pixels).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-034#91:1>
The output can also be printed using the laser printer or fax.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-034#92:1>
3.7 Workflow Workflow is an important unifying factor for the
enterprise-wise imaging and will allow for more accurate decision making.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-034#93:1>
It will automate the flow of documents according to a predesigned
route for action, approval and review.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-034#94:1>
This opens doors for parallel processing of documents.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-034#95:1>
It is also expected to provide an environment to integrate all the
functions such as creation, revision, review, approval, control, archiving,
tracing and displaying documents[7].

<ICE-SIN:W2A-034#96:1>
<h> Fi 3 Image Editor developed by mf6l </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-034#97:1>
A prototype has been built for a workflow mailing or mail sequencing
system [ 8].

<ICE-SIN:W2A-034#98:1>
The initiator creates a workflow mail, specifies the sequence and
passes it to the first person in the sequence.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-034#99:1>
The initiator can add his comments in the attachment.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-034#100:1>
The attachment is used for appending annotations made by each person
in the sequence.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-034#101:1>
A provision is available for any person in the sequence to query the
initiator or people who have already processed the workflow mail.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-034#102:1>
Query messages and clarifications are also treated as annotations.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-034#103:1>
When a mail moves from one person to another, a status mail is
generated and sent to the initiator.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-034#104:1>
Processing workflow mail involves adding annotation and pass it to
the next person ( see figure 4).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-034#105:1>
Workflow system for MDMS can be developed based on this concept.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-034#106:1>
The workflow architecture of MDMS, will facilitate the engineering
change release procedure for engineering documents including drawings within
a distributed manufacturing environment.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-034#107:1>
<h> 3.8 Intelligent Documentation </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-034#108:1>
The system can be enhanced to automatically identify the input
document format of scanned images for classification and indexing purposes.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-034#109:1>
It will have limited capabilities to understand image contents (
referred as image understanding) as human operators do, in order to direct
archival, retrieval and workflow activities within a business.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-034#110:1>
It will be able to search for documents even with incomplete or
erroneous information.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-034#111:1>
3.9 Networking More companies are moving towards globalizing their
businesses and there is a major shift towards decentralized production.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-034#112:1>
This creates a need for the various manufacturing units of an
enterprise to access information and exchange documents among themselves.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-034#113:1>
There will be a need even for cooperative processing in the near
future.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-034#114:1>
The MDMS architecture has been designed to address the need for
multi-enterprise networking.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-034#115:1>
4 Document Standard Document standards are required for document
exchange among a variety of systems.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-034#116:1>
The most significant international standards are the Office Document
Architecture ( ODA-ISO 8613) and the standard Generalized Markup Language (
SGML - IS 8879).

<h> Fi 4 Workflow Mailing System </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-034#129:1>
ODA facilitates the interchange of office documents, such as
reports, invoices, letters, memoranda, etc.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-034#130:1>
ODA treats documents as collections of elements, known as objects.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-034#131:1>
Each object is defined by attributes, which describe its type and
structure.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-034#132:1>
Through its attributes, each object is self-defined and independent
of other objects.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-034#133:1>
Users themselves set and modify the attributes of the objects.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-034#134:1>
For example, a paragraph object has type described as text, and has
attributes such as line length, word spacing, font type, and size that define
its appearance.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-034#135:1>
ODA defines two structures, logical and layout structures that may
be applied to a document. <X>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-034#X136:1>
The logical structure is based on the meaning of various divisions
of the document.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-034#X137:1>
It is primarily hierarchical and sequential.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-034#X138:1>
For example, the logical structure of a document may consist of
chapters, sections and paragraphs, headers, footnotes, illustrations,
sentences, figures, tables, charts, and lists.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-034#X139:1>
The layout structure is structured on the basis of the presentation
of the document when being printed or viewed.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-034#X140:1>
For example, the layout structure of a document may consist of page
set, composite page, basic page and, within the pages, frames and blocks.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-034#X141:1>
The structure of ODA gives its flexibility and reusability.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-034#X142:1>
When creating a document, some parts of it will be in a very
standard form which will be used over and over again.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-034#X143:1>
The best example of this is a style sheet in a desktop publishing.
