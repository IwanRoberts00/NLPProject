<h> <bold> Stop this criminal act </bold> </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-001#2:1>
<p> <smallcaps> IRAQ </smallcaps> 's regional ambitions are not new.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-001#3:1>
What is startling is the crude simplicity of the first step it has
taken towards realising them.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-001#4:1>
Transforming an economic dispute with Kuwait into a military
one, Baghdad yesterday simply invaded its small neighbour reportedly forcing
the Emir to flee the country and installing a so-called <quote> free
government </quote> .

<ICE-SIN:W2E-001#5:1>
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein has lived up to his critics'
description of him as unpredictable and undependable.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-001#6:1>
What remains to be seen is what the rest of the world can do about the
man, his regime, what they stand for in the Middle East and what they mean
for the rest of the world. </p>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-001#7:1>
<p> International reactions have been strong.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-001#8:1>
The UN Security Council met to condemn the invasion and demand the
unconditional withdrawal of the Iraqi troops.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-001#9:1>
Many nations have responded with sharp criticism.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-001#10:1>
US President George Bush has termed the invasion an act of " naked
aggression" and has signed an order freezing control of Iraqi assets in the
US and blocking almost all imports from that country.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-001#11:1>
The Soviet Union has called for the immediate and unconditional
withdrawal of the Iraqi forces.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-001#12:1>
Britain and France have roundly condemned the Iraqi action.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-001#13:1>
The Arab states are meeting to decide on a response.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-001#14:1>
Israel, a traditional target of Iraqi ire, has declared that it is
prepared to meet any attack.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-001#15:1>
Singapore has strongly condemned the invasion, calling it a blatant
disregard of the UN Charter and other fundamental principles of international
law that is a threat to the security of small states everywhere. </p>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-001#16:1>
<p> Indeed, everybody everywhere should be concerned at the implications of
the Iraqi action.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-001#17:1>
It is a reminder, in these times when peace is said to be breaking
out the world over, that the deep-rooted realities of international conflict
will not disappear just because there is super-power peg to hang them on.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-001#18:1>
What is happening, rather, is that the dissolution of US Soviet
rivalry is taking the lid off a veritable Pandora's box of local and
regional conflicts which are steeped in history, culture and the
personality of rulers.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-001#19:1>
If the nuclear balance between East and West was one of terror, it
was also, thankfully, a balance.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-001#20:1>
Smaller fry with big guns, who have no stake in an
international balance of power, have correspondingly fewer
qualms about breaking the
peace around them if they think that others will accept the situation as a
fait accompli. </p>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-001#21:1>
<p> Unless something is done about this terrible disease, the primary
requirements of civilised international behaviour will be drowned in a flood
of spreading anarchy.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-001#22:1>
It is the UN which, as the highest forum of international relations,
should play the leading role in getting Iraq out of Kuwait and restoring
power to the emirate's legitimate rulers.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-001#23:1>
The Arab nations have a special responsibility in this regard, but
everyone should cooperate, for Kuwait must not be allowed to set a
precedent for that most horrendous of international crimes: invasion.
</p> </I>
<I>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-001#24:2>
<h> <bold> Defence is the only defence </bold> </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-001#25:2>
<p> GOOD defences are like good teeth.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-001#26:2>
Both are hardly noticed while they are there; it is only when
the malfunctioning begins that they are missed.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-001#27:2>
The need for a country to have teeth is therefore an entirely apt
metaphor, as Kuwaitis today would be the first to acknowledge.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-001#28:2>
But today is already too late.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-001#29:2>
Defence is what you thought of yesterday and maintain today to meet
the possible dangers of tomorrow.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-001#30:2>
In saying that Singapore must never allow itself to become another
Kuwait, First Deputy Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong correctly reiterated the
crucial importance of a good defence system to national sovereignty and
territorial integrity. </p>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-001#31:2>
<p> The comparison with Kuwait has a specific validity.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-001#32:2>
Both the kingdom and Singapore are small states which cannot threaten
anyone but can only be threatened by others; the prosperity of both
draws not only public commendation but, it might be suspected, a
measure of private jealousy in certain foreign political quarters; and both
nations are part of regions where peace and stability are far from
permanently guaranteed, especially in times of rapid global change.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-001#33:2>
In Kuwait's case, the absence of effective national defence turned
each of these factors against the country.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-001#34:2>
The lesson is that Singapore must never allow such a thing to happen
to itself. </p>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-001#35:2>
<p> Defence needs a good - that is, well-trained and well-equipped -
military, which is why Mr Goh said that Singaporeans should take National
Service seriously and not press for the period of service to be shortened.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-001#36:2>
But defence, to be truly effective, has to go beyond military
deterrence.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-001#37:2>
An active, alert diplomacy is required to plug the country into the
international political grid, primarily the UN.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-001#38:2>
In Singapore's case, the international element has been
emphasised also by giving great powers a stake in the Republic's economic
progress and hence in its security.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-001#39:2>
Ongoing attempts at closer economic interaction with neighbouring
countries should give them a similar stake in Singapore's prosperity.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-001#40:2>
Strengthening Asean should create another layer of protection. </p>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-001#41:2>
<p> All these are external factors which can be underpinned only by social
solidarity and political stability at home.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-001#42:2>
A country is like a family.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-001#43:2>
Differences of race and creed - like personal and intellectual
differences in families - are there in Singapore, but if these take
precedence over the existence of the national family as a tangible,
recognisable entity, the seeds of destruction would have been planted without
enemies abroad having to lift a finger.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-001#44:2>
Thus the need for political stability, the need to recognise the
worth of the government which has made Singapore worth defending.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-001#45:2>
It is necessary for Singaporeans to mull over these things,
individually and collectively.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-001#46:2>
Singapore is too small to determine the nature of international
politics: it is not too small to survive the jungles where that nature roams
wild, red in tooth and claw. </p> </I>
<I>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-001#47:3>
<h> <bold> Telling it like it is </bold> </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-001#48:3>
<p> AS PETROL prices jump at rates Singapore hasn't seen in more than
five years; oil companies are coming under heavy fire for profiteering,
making a fast buck, and other unethical conduct.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-001#49:3>
The hikes themselves are hardly unexpected; the pressure behind the
hikes is the crisis in the Middle East which is causing crude prices to rise
dangerously.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-001#50:3>
The bone of contention is, of course that prices are being upped too
quickly while reserves bought prior to the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait are still
available.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-001#51:3>
Also, falling crude prices are not as quickly reflected in lower
retail prices.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-001#52:3>
But market leader Shell has denied these accusations, backing
them up with statistics showing it was actually faster to reflect
wholesale price drops in lower retail prices, and slower in pushing up pump
prices when crude got more expensive. </p>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-001#53:3>
<p> Business is about profits; to think otherwise would be naive.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-001#54:3>
Deregulation of the oil industry has meant more than anything
else, an opportunity for more competition and, ultimately, fair
profits.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-001#55:3>
The petrol price hikes underway, we trust, are grounded in some
logic, most inherently rising costs.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-001#56:3>
But the hikes are having immediate inflationary effects which don't
portend well for Singapore, particularly at a stage when economic growth is
moderating.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-001#57:3>
As private companies, oil majors here have no legal obligation to
disclose their profit models, or how they arrive at their pricing.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-001#58:3>
But it may be timely and appropriate for oil majors to take the
initiative to inform business and the public of the basis for this round of
price hikes. </p>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-001#59:3>
<p> The consequences the hikes could potentially have on the economy
and business competitiveness are immeasurable, particularly with no
easy solution to the Middle East crisis in sight.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-001#60:3>
As tensions escalate, the oil supply situation in that region
threatens to become even more precarious, despite excess supply
internationally.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-001#61:3>
As an open economy which depends on its links to the outside world,
Singapore is potentially in an equally precarious position.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-001#62:3>
At a time like this, a gesture of goodwill is necessary.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-001#63:3>
It would be in the interest of oil companies to take the initiative
this point to allay fears of profiteering, and reassure public confidence.
</p>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-001#64:3>
<p> Price hikes are never painless.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-001#65:3>
But it helps to understand the nature and the source of the pain.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-001#66:3>
It may be more painful to suffer in ignorance.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-001#67:3>
Oil majors have always held a distinctive stature in the local
economy.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-001#68:3>
For all practical purposes, they provide an essential service which
Singapore depends on critically.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-001#69:3>
Conversely, oil companies, with their vast stakes here, also have a
vested interest in Singapore's economic well-being.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-001#70:3>
Oil is business, big business.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-001#71:3>
But there must be an implicit trust, almost faith, that doing
business here is mutually beneficial, to the economy and to consumers.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-001#72:3>
As responsible corporate citizens, the onus is on oil companies to do
the right thing by Singapore.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-001#73:3>
Tell it like it is. </p> </I>
<I>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-001#74:4>
<h> <bold> S'pore is better prepared </bold> </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-001#75:4>
<p> <smallcaps> THE </smallcaps> dramatic events sparked by Iraq's
invasion of Kuwait have only underlined Singapore's economic vulnerability.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-001#76:4>
Just half a month ago, government officials were optimistically
envisaging growth of the economy reaching or even topping their higher-end
prediction of 8 per cent for this year.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-001#77:4>
Last week, in the wake of sharp stock and money market reaction
worldwide to the invasion, the official projection was decidedly more
cautious.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-001#78:4>
The new developments made it <quote> much less likely that we will
exceed 8 per cent growth in 1990 </quote> , the Ministry of Trade and
Industry said.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-001#79:4>
Still, the MTI remained confident that its original forecast of
6 to 8 per cent growth would be achieved, given the momentum from the
first half of the year.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-001#80:4>
But local business was not much heartened, if the stock market was
any indication.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-001#81:4>
Share prices continued their downward spiral apace with
international markets, and have shown rather less bounce on the upswing
compared to their regional and international counterparts. </p>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-001#82:4>
<p> The fear of inflation fuelled by the surge in crude oil prices is only
one reason, and quite likely not the major one either.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-001#83:4>
There is a larger concern that the oil price hike could be the weight
that tips an already debt-heavy American economy into recession.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-001#84:4>
Japanese growth, so dependent on imported oil, is a related worry.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-001#85:4>
With the first quarter having registered a marked slowdown in the
growth of total trade - 6 per cent, from the 19 per cent of the previous
quarter - a further weakening of the Republic's major markets is not
something to relish. </p>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-001#86:4>
<p> But if an international slowdown has to come, the encouraging news is
that Singapore is now in a better position to deal with it.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-001#87:4>
Learning from the 1985/86 recession, it now has several mechanisms in
place to better deal with the vagaries of the international economy.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-001#88:4>
Business indicators, at home and abroad, are more closely monitored,
as are business costs in Singapore and the country's closest competitors.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-001#89:4>
And there has been a marked improvement in the quality,
frequency and public availability of economic data, for better
decision-making in the private and public sectors. </p>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-001#90:4>
<p> Then there is the flexi-wage system, potentially the most valuable
of these mechanisms.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-001#91:4>
Flexi-wages, properly designed and implemented, offer employer
and employee the best guarantee of optimal remuneration even with large
fluctuations in the national economy and hence company performance.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-001#92:4>
Its advantage shows up most clearly when compared with blunt
instruments for the industry or economy, such as cuts in CPF contribution.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-001#93:4>
Under the flexi-wage system, the fine-tuning of remuneration
can be done at the company level can be applied earlier, and restored as
quickly when circumstances improve.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-001#94:4>
For those companies still hesitating over implementing flexi-wages,
the incentive to do so should be stronger now. </p> </I>
<I>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-001#95:5>
<h> <bold> Closer to the precipice </bold> </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-001#96:5>
<p> <smallcaps> WHY </smallcaps> is it that the Middle East cannot
rid its politics of terrorism?

<ICE-SIN:W2E-001#97:5>
Taking people hostage, while not a monopoly of that region or areas
close to it, has been perfected there.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-001#98:5>
Libya elevated terrorism to the level of a philosophy, and Iran
gave the philosophy a nasty twist when it extended hostage-taking to
diplomats.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-001#99:5>
Now comes Iraq holding thousands of foreigners ransom in a bid to
prevent other countries from contesting a possible extension of its invasion
of Kuwait into Saudi Arabia.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-001#100:5>
The Iraqi action is doubly reprehensible. <X>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-001#X101:5>
Whereas earlier instances of terrorism possessed a
semi-anarchic quality - which does not legitimise them but at least explains
some of their ultra-revolutionary fervour - Mr Saddam Hussein's use of
foreigners as a human shield blatantly utilises every legitimate
resource of state power, publicly and cynically, to commit a patently illegal
act.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-001#X102:5>
If he gets away with this, we might as well cease speaking of
civilised international relations. </p>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-001#X103:5>
<p> What is ironic is that Mr Hussein, in his very extremism, has left others
with very few options.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-001#X104:5>
In the absence of a viable alternative, the West may be forced to
give Iraq a quick sharp and decisive reply.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-001#X105:5>
The response may consist of tactical strikes on essential military
and other installations in Iraq with the aim of avoiding large civilian
casualties, but escalation - caused, for example, by Baghdad using chemical
weapons - might lead to such unfortunate destruction.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-001#X106:5>
Within the Western camp, the US might find itself taking the lead
and perhaps even moving unilaterally if coordination with other
countries poses political difficulties and costly operational delays.
</p>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-001#X107:5>
<p> Other factors suggest that Iraqi intransigence may force the West's
hand.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-001#X108:5>
First, any pussy-footing by the Western powers will turn the
spotlight on Israel, which has everything to fear from an expansionary Iraq,
and probably lead to an Arab-lsraeli conflict profoundly destabilising
to the international order.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-001#X109:5>
Secondly, while a war with Iraq will hurt the international
economy, the depth of that damage will be less than if a deadly uncertainty
continues to hang over a bristling Middle East.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-001#X110:5>
Thirdly, the Soviet Union and other countries, in spite of expected
verbal condemnations of any major US move, are unlikely to contest it.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-001#X111:5>
Last, and certainly not least, the fate of the foreigners in Iraq
and Kuwait is a horrifying reality, but if the price for their freedom is
acceptance of terrorism, more people will pay in future at the hands of
dictators who have smelt blood. </p>

<ICE-SIN:W2E-001#X112:5>
<p> What is at stake is the existence of a system of international behaviour
built up painstakingly since World War II.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-001#X113:5>
The Iraqi aggression against Kuwait is a structural threat to that
system which, for all its imperfections, has preserved global peace for the
past 45 years.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-001#X114:5>
The root of the problem in the Middle East today is Iraq's invasion
of Kuwait.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-001#X115:5>
If Baghdad really wants peace, it should withdraw from that
country.

<ICE-SIN:W2E-001#X116:5>
The choice is Iraq's. </p> </X> </I>
