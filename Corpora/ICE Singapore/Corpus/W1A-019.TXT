Q2 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-019#2:1>
Code switching refers to
the use of one or more languages within a speech event but across sentence
boundary, that is codeswitching is an inter-sentential phenomenon.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-019#3:1>
Code switching is frequently evident in informal speech
situations whereby one speaker wishes to acknowledge an element of solidarity
and intimacy with another speaker or when the speaker belongs to a particular
group whose members are adapt at and frequently codeswitch.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-019#4:1>
It may also be the case whereby a speaker wishes to be
identified as a member of a group or be accepted as a member of a particular
group. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-019#5:1>
Hence code-switching is felt by many linguists
to be motivated primarily by sociolinguistsic concerns whereby the topic,
locale, domain and role-relationship between participants play an extremely
intricate role in the code-switching phenomenon. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-019#6:1>
Hence, some linguists may ask then what are the linguistic constraints of
code-switching if any and how, when, why and with whom does the
code-switching phenomenon occurs. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-019#7:1>
The broadest aspect
by which one can formulate in sociolinguistic terms with regards to what
happens when speakers code-switch hence deals with the notion of when, why
and with whom code-switching occurs. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-019#8:1>
Code-switching
unlike diglossia occurs frequently without the conscious knowledge of its
interactors so that if one were to ask a code-switcher after a speech event
what particular variety of language he uses for the entire course of the
speech event, he frequently cannot tell which particular code he has used for
a particular topic of discussion during the speech event.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-019#9:1>
As has been mentioned, code-switching frequently occurs
in informal situation whereby the aim of code-switching is primarily to
indicate solidarity and intimacy between speakers. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-019#10:1>
It
may also be used to indicate depersonalization and objectiveness.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-019#11:1>
It may also be used to reaffirm a particular point
made. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-019#12:1>
Besides, code-switching between speakers may
also be seen as a subtle attempt to exclude others in the speech event.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-019#13:1>
All these aspects refer to the sociolinguistic motive
of code-switching. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-019#14:1>
Code-switching, hence, is a
communicative device used by speakers which in turn reflects upon their
individual creativity. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-019#15:1>
In Singapore especially,
code-switching is a common phenomenon be it for establishing distance or
solidarity and intimacy. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-019#16:1>
Besides, in the Singapore
context, the use of particles such as 'la', 'loh', 'hah' and a host of other
particles enhances the essence of code-switching in Singapore.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-019#17:1>
Such use of particles adds a unique flavour and colour
to informal Singapore English. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-019#18:1>
These particles carry
semantic content and non-Chinese Singaporeans are also ( also) of its
existence, use and meaning conveyed. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-019#19:1>
These particles
especially, when used by code-switchers also establishes the intonation
pattern of the discourse and often lead to be a source of perplexity for non-
Singaporean speakers of English especially with regards to the attitudes
conveyed by code-switchers who use such particles. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-019#20:1>
Besides, there is a host of non-verbal gestures that is used by
code-switchers too and these ) non-verbal gestures) often provide(s) an
indication as to why they ( code-switchers) laugh at a particular point in
time of interaction while non-Singaporean users stand looking at them with
doubt. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-019#21:1>
Again, a sense of exclusion is established with
regards to outsiders by code-switchers. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-019#22:1>
Hence, from
the above phenomenon mentioned with regards to the sociolinguistic aspects of
code-switching, it is evident that code-switching certainly plays an
important role in present Singapore, especially among the younger generation
of Singaporeans primarily to establish solidarity and intimacy or distance
depending on the context of situation. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-019#23:1>
Besides,
sometimes code-switching occurs because a particular topic is discussible??

<ICE-SIN:W1A-019#24:1>
only in a particular code X rather than code Y
primarily because code Y may lack the vocabulary core to handle it or the
topic is felt to be best if discussed in code X or may even because the
speakers are adapt(adept??) at handling that particular topic in code X.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-019#25:1>
Domain also play an important role in the context of
code-switching. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-019#26:1>
Frequently in formal situations and
speech situations, code-switching do not occur unless of course when the
speaker wishes to create humour or to put his intentions across to others
more succinctly(succinctly??). 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-019#27:1>
Role-relationship
between speakers also determine whether code-switching occurs at all.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-019#28:1>
Frequently, when interacting with persons of superior
status with whom one is subordinate to, codeswitching is least evident.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-019#29:1>
Besides, the other speaker's capability at
code-switching is taken into consideration too before any evident
code-switching phenomenon may occur. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-019#30:1>
Hence,
code-switching certainly does not mean following a fixed prescribed set of
rules, it depends on situational norms to communicate metaphoric information
about how words are to be understood by others. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-019#31:1>
hence,
speakers background knowledge, social presuppositions and context
constraints(constraints) all come into play as sociolinguistic considerations
for speakers when code-switching. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-019#32:1>
Code-switching is
not simply a haphazard communicative phenomenon; it involves an acute grasp
of the communicative norms existing in a particular society. </I>

Q4 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-019#34:2>
Communicative or
discourse particles such as 'la', 'loh', 'meh' and a host of others play an
intricate role in English spoken in Singapore. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-019#35:2>
In
Singapore, there exist a speech continuum ranging from the highest that is,
the acrolect sub variety, followed by the upper and lower mesolect and
finally the lowest the sub-variety, that ism the basilect.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-019#36:2>
These communicative and discourse particles are most
evident in the informal, communicative norm situation of Singapore.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-019#37:2>
Hence, in terms of the sub-varieties evident in
Singapore's speech continuum, communicative and discourse particles are
frequently evident at the mesolectal and basilectal level of the speech
continuum. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-019#38:2>
These communicative or discourse particles
have been claimed by some local linguists such as Mary Tay that they are
derived from the Hokkien dialect of Singapore. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-019#39:2>
However, due to Singapore's multi-lingual phenomenon, these communicative or
discourse particles have been slowly assimilated by the various speech
communities existing in Singapore such as the Malays, Tamils and other
dialects of the Chinese community. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-019#40:2>
In fact, its use
have(has) expanded from intra-ethnic communication to inter-ethinic
communication. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-019#41:2>
In Singapore, there is the L(Low) and
H(High) variety of English and Mandarin. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-019#42:2>
The H(High)
variety of English or the acrolectal variety is used primarily for formal,
public and even formal writing(writing) situations. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-019#43:2>
The Low Variety of English is used also with its vernacular variety for
intra-ethnic communication. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-019#44:2>
The Low variety (
mesolectal and basilectal variety) is used for inter-ethnic communication as
well. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-019#45:2>
In Singapore, the H variety of Mandarin is used
to link Singapore to China. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-019#46:2>
The L variety of spoken
English is used primarily to establish solidarity and intimacy hence
minimising the social distance between interactors in a communicative norm
situation. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-019#47:2>
These use of communicative norm establishes
the situational and communicative needs of the speaker.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-019#48:2>
The use of communicative or discourse particles is
attached to the low ( L) variety of spoken Singapore English to become L + la
to enhance the solidarity and intimate feeling existing among or between
participants in s speech situation. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-019#49:2>
It adds a distinct
flavour of creativity, uniqueness, ingenuity and most important a
self-identifying local variety of spoken Singapore English.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-019#50:2>
These communicative and discourse particles carry
semantic meanings and are known and used by members of other dialect groups
as well. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-019#51:2>
The use of these communicative or discourse
devices depends on several socio-cultural factors and situations as well.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-019#52:2>
it depends on situation, the role-relationship
existing between participants and the topic of discussion.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-019#53:2>
However, it is most evident in situations of
informality and also between people of similar social ranks.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-019#54:2>
In a situation where one is subordinate to another,
the L + la variety is least likely to occur. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-019#55:2>
The la
particle usually occurs at the end of a phrase or sentence and its primary
motive is to establish solidarity, rapport, informality and familiarity.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-019#56:2>
These communicative or discourse devices have
frequently been labelled as code makers or code labels because they carry
part of the meaning of the message and also identify the style of the
interaction. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-019#57:2>
Their effective use involves knowledge of
a set of socio-linguistic norms. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-019#58:2>
For example, persons
who are not knowledgeable with regards to the use of these communicative
devices may employ them in formal situations or may even adopt an incorrect
choice of these communicative devices for a particular situation.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-019#59:2>
Hence, owing to the existence of a continuum of speech
varieties in Singapore beside the fact that for most period of social
interaction among intra and inter-ethnic communities, the L + la variety is
adopted to establish familiarity, solidarity, informality and rapport.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-019#60:2>
The use of these communicative or discourse particles
have thus become part and parcel of our communicative norm.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-019#61:2>
The creative aspect of the individuals derived through
the use of these communicative or discourse devices has indeed enabled
Singapore to achieve the status of a distinct social entity in the eyes of
foreign as well as local linguists. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-019#62:2>
In fact, there has
even been local books written by local writers who use the communicative or
discourse particles in their narratives. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-019#63:2>
This
technique helps to enhance the flavour of Singapore writing.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-019#64:2>
However, there are worries attached to this use of
communicative or discourse devices especially with regards as to whether it
will lower Singapore standard of spoken English. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-019#65:2>
Nonetheless, I firmly feel that sociolinguists should study the communicative
or discourse particles in the English spoken in Singapore because these
particles have become part and parcel and also an intricate part of our lives
especially in the area of communicative norm. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-019#66:2>
it gives
Singapore a sense of self identity and uniqueness not found in any other
speech communities outside of Singapore. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-019#67:2>
Therefore,
what better ways there are for sociolinguists to understand the inhabitants
of Singapore and thus their use of language than through a study of the
communicative norms of its people and this certainly involves a study of
Singapore's communicative particles as well. </I>

<ICE-SIN:W1A-019#68:3>
Q6 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-019#69:3>
Before achieving
independence in 1965, Singapore has five major languages, namely, English,
Hokkien, Mandarin, Tamil and Malay. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-019#70:3>
After attaining
independence, five out of the four major languages was given official status,
namely, English, Mandarin, Tamil and Malay. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-019#71:3>
English is
chosen because of its important role in international trade while the other
three represent the major language of its inhabitants. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-019#72:3>
Malay as the additional status of national language not because of majority
of its people are conversant in Malay but because of its relations with the
Malay world. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-019#73:3>
However, what is interesting about the
Singapore context is that English has begun to play a role of increasing
importance among its people. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-019#74:3>
English is taught
primarily in school and plays a role of utmost importance for interaction
with the outside world. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-019#75:3>
It also provides one with good
opportunities in employment and in the commercial and business sectors.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-019#76:3>
In fact, English has acquired an extremely important
status in Singapore through constant promotions and campaigns by its
government. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-019#77:3>
The government of Singapore hopes to
attain a level of English in Singapore that is on par with that of the
Standard British English. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-019#78:3>
Singapore English differs in
phonology and vocabulary with Standard British English but has ( Singapore
English) a close affinity in the area of grammar with Standard British
English. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-019#79:3>
Hence, it is in the area of phonology and
vocabulary that Singapore's English establishes a clear mark from that of
British English. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-019#80:3>
It is this area of phonology and
vocabulary that Singapore culture comes into play. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-019#81:3>
Singapore culture shapes and moulds its vocabulary and phonology.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-019#82:3>
Hence, due to Singapore's multilingual society, the
culture of each major dialect group comes into play in shaping its vocabulary
and phonology. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-019#83:3>
Singapore English has in its vocabulary
core terms taken from background language. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-019#84:3>
terms such
as 'amah', 'towkay', 'kampung' and a host of others are derived from its
major ethnic groups. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-019#85:3>
Besides, the linguistic
environment in which one is taught how to speak English also affects the
accent of the learner. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-019#86:3>
for example, in the area of
phonology, Standard British English has only 1 nucleus in a sentence but in
Singapore English there are usually more than one. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-019#87:3>
Besides, Singapore English tends to have no distinction between stress on
different categories of words ( 'increase' as verb and 'increase' as noun).

<ICE-SIN:W1A-019#88:3>
Singapore English tends to be syllable timed.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-019#89:3>
These difference and a host of others are due
primarily from interference from one's own culture or even from other
cultures with the community. </I>
