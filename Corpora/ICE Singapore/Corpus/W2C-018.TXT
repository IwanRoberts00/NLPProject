<h> Private firm gets job to ferry SAF troops to Pulau Tekong </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2C-018#2:1>
By Matthew Pereira

<ICE-SIN:W2C-018#3:1>
A PRIVATE company has taken over the ferrying of SAF troops and
equipment from the mainland to its training area on Pulau Tekong.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-018#4:1>
The move is part of the Defence Ministry's on-going efforts to
privatise its non-essential services to keep manpower costs down.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-018#5:1>
It will also help free the resources of the Republic of Singapore Navy
( RSN), which has been ferrying the troops, for more effective operational
deployment.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-018#6:1>
The task of shuttling the Changi-Tekong route was given to Tian San
Shipping two months ago.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-018#7:1>
The shipping company's general manager, Mr Ho Sow Wah, said: " The
arrangement with the navy is on a time-charter basis, where we provide the
crew, fuel, boat, maintenance and everything."

<ICE-SIN:W2C-018#8:1>
He added: " The arrangement is just like chartering a bus the people
engaging us do not have to worry about anything."

<ICE-SIN:W2C-018#9:1>
The vessels used for the ferry service, each 30-metre-long, can match
the RSN's capability and can transport, for example, six three-ton trucks at
one go.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-018#10:1>
But most of the time they will be used to ferry recruits who do their
Basic Military Training on Pulau Tekong to and from the island.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-018#11:1>
The company has to match the navy's readiness level as well.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-018#12:1>
Said Mr Ho: " We have to have two of these vessels on stand-by, 24
hours a day, 365 days a year." The vessels make scheduled trips to the island
and back but are available on call too.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-018#13:1>
Noted Mr Ho: " There are times when the SAF holds night training, and
we have to move the men back at whatever time they finish their training."
The move to hire a civilian contractor to operate the ferry service ties in
with Mindef's objective of making better use of scarce manpower resources.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-018#14:1>
It has been increasing its use of civilian staff or contractors in
support roles to release more SAF personnel for combat duties.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-018#15:1>
The privatisation of the service also allows the navy to reduce the
administrative duties and responsibilities for the ferry service.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-018#16:1>
The RSN had a similar arrangement with the Port of Singapore
Authority, which took over the ferrying of men to the Brani Naval Base from
the navy for some time.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-018#17:1>
It ended recently with the opening of the bridge to the island last
year. </I>

<h> Best Unit Award winners find it tougher each year </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2C-018#19:2>
By Matthew Pereira

<ICE-SIN:W2C-018#20:2>
WITHIN a year, the RSS Valiant not only joined the Navy as a fully
operational battle ship, but also went on to take this year's Best Ship
award.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-018#21:2>
Its commanding officer Major Chng Teow Hiang, said the award did not
come by accident.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-018#22:2>
" We started off with the objective of winning the award," he said.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-018#23:2>
Other winners include the commandos, who picked up the Best Combat
Unit title for the 11th time, while the Air Force's 125th Squadron took the
Best Tactical Support Award.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-018#24:2>
They are among 11 top units from the Army, Navy and Air Force which
will receive the much-sought after Best Unit Awards at the Singapore Armed
Forces Day Parade on July

<ICE-SIN:W2C-018#25:2>
1. The Valiant became fully operational in March last year and wasted
no time setting its sights on the award, said Major Chng.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-018#26:2>
He added: " You do not just saunter along and hope that you win the
award by chance."

<ICE-SIN:W2C-018#27:2>
He said he checked the unit's progress every month, rectified what he
thought were its weak areas and kept at improving the whole year.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-018#28:2>
" This is also a competition for consistency," he noted.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-018#29:2>
" It assesses your year-round performance.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-018#30:2>
You cannot make a sprint in the last quarter and hope to pick up the
award." The Best Combat Unit, the 1st Commando Battalion, on the other hand,
is an old hand at winning the competition.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-018#31:2>
It picked up the award for the 11th time since 1974.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-018#32:2>
But the unit's Commanding Officer, Major Chiang Hock Tew, said: " It
is get-ting harder each year.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-018#33:2>
" The point count of the top units is getting closer by the year.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-018#34:2>
But it is the reputation, the fact that we are the Commandos, the
elite, the ones with the red beret which makes the men push themselves a
little bit harder." The Commandos are experts in several special skills, such
as rappelling, jungle survival, demolition, infantry small arms and signal
communications.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-018#35:2>
For 125 Squadron, realistic tactical flying was one of the factors
which clinched the award for them, said its commanding officer, Major S
Thanabalan.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-018#36:2>
He did not want to elaborate on what tactical flying meant, except to
say that it was more than flying from point A to point B.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-018#37:2>
" Doing that is really tough and pushed the men to their limits.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-018#38:2>
Everyone talks about learning from their mistakes.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-018#39:2>
" We cannot make mistakes." </I>

<h> Navy's first mine hunter launched in Sweden </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2C-018#41:3>
By Mathew Pereira

<ICE-SIN:W2C-018#42:3>
THE first of the Singapore Navy's new mine countermeasure vessels (
MCMVs), was launched in Sweden by Mrs Yeo Ning Hong, the wife of Singapore's
Defence Minister, on Thursday.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-018#43:3>
Christened RSS Bedok, it is one of four such vessels which the
Republic of Singapore Navy ( RSN) is acquiring to protect and keep
Singapore's sea lanes of communication open.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-018#44:3>
The other three minehunters are the RSS Kallang, RSS Katong and RSS
Punggol.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-018#45:3>
The 47-metre-long ships, weighing 360 tons each, are highly
maneuverable and can detect, locate, identify and destroy mines.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-018#46:3>
They can reach speeds of up to 15 knots and are each equipped with a
40 mm Bofors gun and computerised navigation and minehunting information
systems.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-018#47:3>
They also carry remote-operated underwater mine disposal vehicles.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-018#48:3>
The Ministry of Defence said in a press statement that the narrow and
shallow sea lanes around Singapore are vulnerable to mining, and that the
minehunters will keep this economic lifeline open and safe.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-018#49:3>
The Swedish-built RSS Bedok is being outfitted and will undergo sea
trials later this year before it is delivered to Singapore early next year.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-018#50:3>
The hulls of the other three ships were also built in the
Karlskronvarvet Shipyard in Sweden, but will be outfitted here by Singapore
Shipbuilding & Engineering ( SSE).

<ICE-SIN:W2C-018#51:3>
One is being outfitted in Singapore and the other two will be
delivered to Singapore at intervals over the next few years.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-018#52:3>
A project team comprising officers and engineers from the Defence
Material Organisation ( a member of the Defence Technology Group, Mindef) and
the RSN designed and developed the ships.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-018#53:3>
The ships' names were picked from a selection of entries sent in by
participants of the Navy's " Name Hunt" contest launched in January.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-018#54:3>
Present at the launch of the first MCMV in Sweden were the Minister
for Defence, Dr Yeo Ning Hong; the Swedish Defence Minister, Mr Anders
Bjorck; the Chief of Navy, Colonel Kwek Siew Jin; and senior Mindef, RSN and
Royal Swedish Navy officers.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-018#55:3>
Dr Yeo, who is on a three-day visit to Sweden, called the launching
of the RSS Bedok " another symbol of the close defence relations between
Sweden and Singapore".

<ICE-SIN:W2C-018#56:3>
" Our two countries share many similarities.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-018#57:3>
Both of us are small nations in regions of larger nations," he noted.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-018#58:3>
" Both of us are committed to defence in order that our people may
continue to live in peace and prosperity." The ultimate male?

<ICE-SIN:W2C-018#59:3>
Why did they do it?

<ICE-SIN:W2C-018#60:3>
GERALDINE KAN asks a doctor, a banker and an engineer, who are all
game to show themselves off in the Manhunt contest later this month.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-018#61:3>
ON JUNE 25, a doctor, banker and engineer will exchange their work
suits, ties and in one case, stethoscope, for skin-tight swimming trunks and
evening wear, parade around on stage and vie for the title of the ultimate
Singapore man.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-018#62:3>
Clean-cut and smart, the three are finalists in the Manhunt Singapore '
93 contest beauty pageant for men.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-018#63:3>
In casual shirts and jeans, relaxed and smiling after a game of pool,
Rohan Mendis ( doctor), Kenneth Tan ( banker) and Timothy Wang ( engineer),
all look like the sweet young man next door.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-018#64:3>
So why do they allow themselves to become part of a beefcake flesh
parade?

<ICE-SIN:W2C-018#65:3>
Or are they really a shortlist for the ultimate, as the organisers,
Metromedia, claims?

<ICE-SIN:W2C-018#66:3>
" It's not just about looks and body," says 25-year-old Mendis, who
entered the contest to see how far he could go.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-018#67:3>
" You've got to show your confidence and personality - there's much
more to it." Points are divided between swimwear, evening wear and
off-the-cuff interview segments to judge their physique, poise and
personality.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-018#68:3>
Their co-workers seem to take their competing in stride.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-018#69:3>
Wang's general manager even teased the 27-year-old about being extra
careful on the streets after all the media attention.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-018#70:3>
Tan is pretty confident that fellow bankers and clients will not
think any less of him.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-018#71:3>
" They know I draw a line between my professional life and extra
curricula activities.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-018#72:3>
I still take my work very seriously." And if someone laughs at the
25-year-old who has to saunter in his skivvies?

<ICE-SIN:W2C-018#73:3>
" That's a risk I'll have to take," says Tan.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-018#74:3>
Mostly, it is the " personality" part of the contest that the three
guys hinge on to take the edge off the flesh parade charge.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-018#75:3>
" It's not degrading.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-018#76:3>
It's really not that different wearing swimming trunks on stage or at
the beach, people still look at you," says Wang.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-018#77:3>
" Anyway, even a good physique doesn't come just like that it takes
discipline and work." Mendis' mother, however, apparently stared in surprised
silence at a sizeable colour photo of her son, in tight swimming trunks in
The New Paper.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-018#78:3>
Another relative said he was so embarrassed that he would not attend
the finals.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-018#79:3>
His girlfriend, however, has been very supportive of his move, from
discussing the pros and cons of entering the contest, to telling him how to
remove his makeup after a shoot.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-018#80:3>
But a brief walk on stage is where they draw the line.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-018#81:3>
They say that they would never parade around in G-strings or do a
striptease like the Hotbods men did a few months ago.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-018#82:3>
" Shows like that are designed to inspire lust - now that's
degrading," says Tan.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-018#83:3>
So just what is the ultimate Singapore man, anyway?

<ICE-SIN:W2C-018#84:3>
" Intelligent, with above-average looks, healthy someone who lives
life to the fullest," he says, and smiles cheekily.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-018#85:3>
" I'd rate myself an eight since I model the ultimate after myself."
So why did they enter?

<ICE-SIN:W2C-018#86:3>
Is there not just a tiny urge to show off?

<ICE-SIN:W2C-018#87:3>
" We just want to present ourselves at our best," says Tan, " After
all, we're supposed to represent the ultimate." Fair enough, but take note.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-018#88:3>
These are three guys who did push-ups before the photo session to
make their muscles look bigger in front of the camera.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-018#89:3>
The finals for Manhunt Singapore ' 93 will be at Orchard Hotel on
June 25 at 8.30 pm.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-018#90:3>
Tickets are at
&dollar;88 and
&dollar;128, inclusive of dinner at 7 pm.

<h> Three generals promoted </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2C-018#93:4>
By dominic Nathan

<ICE-SIN:W2C-018#94:4>
Three Singapore Armed forces officers will move up to the rank of
major-general in this year's promotion exercise.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-018#95:4>
Adding a second general's star to their epaulettes are the Chief of
Army, Brigadier-general Lim Chuan Poh; the chief of Air Force, BG Raymond Ng;
and the chief of Joint Staff, BG Ng Yat Chung, who is also the directore of
the joing operations and planning directorate.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-018#96:4>
They are among 477 officers promoted this year.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-018#97:4>
Those promoted to lieutenant-colonel or a higher rank received their
certificates of promotion from the Deputy Prime Minister and Defence
Minister, Dr tony Tan, yesterday.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-018#98:4>
Among them are two women officers who are being made
lieutenant-colonel, the highest rank so far for women in the SAF.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-018#99:4>
But heading this year's list is the chief of Defence Force,
Lieutenant-general Bey Soo Khiang who retains the same rank but moves up in
grade from superscale B to B1.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-018#100:4>
Four officers holding the rank of brigadier-general and one officer
who is a rear-admiral, the naval equivalent of that rank, are also being
promoted in grade.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-018#101:4>
Getting their first general's star to break intot the top echelons
of military hierarchy as brigadier-general are six officers who are now
colonels. <X>

<ICE-SIN:W2C-018#X102:4>
In addition, five officers holding the rank of lieutenant-colonel,
and who are all SAF Overseas Scholars, are being promoted in grade to
sueprscale G.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-018#X103:4>
All are 32.
