<ICE-SIN:S1B-011#1:1>
Although I'm inclined to lock the door

<ICE-SIN:S1B-011#2:1>
Alright I don't need that many handouts since there's only less than
half a class here

<ICE-SIN:S1B-011#3:1>
Let's start on this side

<ICE-SIN:S1B-011#4:1>
Six pages

<ICE-SIN:S1B-011#5:1>
Okay

<ICE-SIN:S1B-011#6:1>
I think we should begin

<ICE-SIN:S1B-011#7:1>
We've wasted enough time

<ICE-SIN:S1B-011#8:1>
People coming late

<ICE-SIN:S1B-011#9:1>
Let's pick up where we stop

<ICE-SIN:S1B-011#10:1>
The last thing the last lecture we look at the application of
kinetics in the biological treatment

<ICE-SIN:S1B-011#11:1>
We left off looking at a simple case simplest case that is a CSTR and
we also look at the CSTR that is without recycle

<ICE-SIN:S1B-011#12:1>
Uh do you recall your adapt uh your connection activator's sludge and
all the other arrangements there would almost invariably would have they
would have a recycled <unclear> word </unclear> right

<ICE-SIN:S1B-011#13:1>
So let us look at this case now where there is a recycled <unclear>
word </unclear>

<ICE-SIN:S1B-011#14:1>
Okay before we have our reactor our CSTR your inflow coming in this
uh mix well CSTR

<ICE-SIN:S1B-011#15:1>
I suppose to the previous uh arrangement you saw

<ICE-SIN:S1B-011#16:1>
Now we've got a settling unit and part of it is recycled

<ICE-SIN:S1B-011#17:1>
Now in this case our we have sludge wasted from the reactor that is a
certain stream is taken off from the reactor

<ICE-SIN:S1B-011#18:1>
I think the previous scheme I showed you uh sludge is wasted from the
settling tank right

<ICE-SIN:S1B-011#19:1>
So these are two possible arrangements you can have either sludge
wasted from the settling tank i-e here or from the reactor and of course part
of it is recycled back to the reactor

<ICE-SIN:S1B-011#>
And do you recall the there has to be a balance between the part of the
sludge that is wasted to the sludge that is recycled and I'm sure you know
why there has to be this balance right

<ICE-SIN:S1B-011#20:1>
Okay let us let us now look at the analysis of this arrangement

<ICE-SIN:S1B-011#21:1>
Okay the usual assump usual assumptions made are before two things

<ICE-SIN:S1B-011#22:1>
Number one x-y is zero that is your inflow comes in where's no
micro-organisms

<ICE-SIN:S1B-011#23:1>
Okay this second assumption made well actually it's not this one but 'cos
your x by the z is zero alright and and in this case actually we <unclear>
word </unclear> have another assumption

<ICE-SIN:S1B-011#24:1>
X-e is zero i-e your effluent leaving your settling tank is X X-e
zero

<ICE-SIN:S1B-011#25:1>
Okay now because of the presence of the settling unit you made two
additional assumptions

<ICE-SIN:S1B-011#26:1>
First of all waste stabilisation occurs only in the reactor that is
here

<ICE-SIN:S1B-011#27:1>
That means you're saying there is no waste stabilisation occurring in
the settling tank

<ICE-SIN:S1B-011#28:1>
Now this of course will be conservative since there will be some
degree of waste stabilisation by the micro-organisms in the settling unit as
well right

<ICE-SIN:S1B-011#29:1>
But for analysis we make this assumption that any B-O-D ah with
<unclear> word </unclear> taking place only in this unit Secondly volume use
in calculating the mean cell residence time all the system includes only the
volume of the reactor unit okay

<ICE-SIN:S1B-011#30:1>
So since this follows up from here right since there's no B-O-D
<unclear> word </unclear> in this unit alright you may consider the mean cell
residence time you only take into account the volume of your reactor

<ICE-SIN:S1B-011#31:1>
Okay so by definition the mean hydraulic retention time all the
reactor that teta will be d over q v will be your volume of your reactor that
your fluid b ah b is constant

<ICE-SIN:S1B-011#32:1>
This time if you consider hydraulic retention time for the systemthen for the system b will be reactor volume plus <unclear> word </unclear>tank volume alright

<ICE-SIN:S1B-011#33:1>
So your mean cell residence time teta c we call that definition teta
c will be mass of cells in the reactor over mass of cells wasted per day

<ICE-SIN:S1B-011#34:1>
Mass of cells in the reactor that's v-x in the reactor

<ICE-SIN:S1B-011#35:1>
Mass of cells wasted per day that will depend on your scheme alright

<ICE-SIN:S1B-011#36:1>
If you look at your flow sheet up here

<ICE-SIN:S1B-011#37:1>
If you look at your reactor mass of cells wasted per day

<ICE-SIN:S1B-011#38:1>
If you draw an overall uh boundary surface here or control surface

<ICE-SIN:S1B-011#39:1>
Okay cells leaving the boundary would be this one q-w-x plus anycells leaving from the settling tank

<ICE-SIN:S1B-011#40:1>
Okay which is q minus q-w X-e alright

<ICE-SIN:S1B-011#41:1>
Q-w would be <unclear> word </unclear> liquid containing biological
cells to be wasted from the system

<ICE-SIN:S1B-011#42:1>
Okay in this case from the reactor X-e concentration of your micro-organisms in effluent from the settling unit and
if you recall we also made the assumptions that X-e is close to zero alright

<ICE-SIN:S1B-011#43:1>
Now this is the case for simple manure proper settling

<ICE-SIN:S1B-011#44:1>
So the quantity of micro-organisms leaving there don't it's very small

<ICE-SIN:S1B-011#45:1>
X-e approximates to zero

<ICE-SIN:S1B-011#46:1>
Then your mean cells residence time simplifies to q teta c is c over
q-w alright

<ICE-SIN:S1B-011#47:1>
And if you do the mass balance for micro-organisms in the entire
system your accumulation inflow outflow and your net growth accumulation term

<ICE-SIN:S1B-011#48:1>
The outgrowth this is the amount leaving the reactor the amount
leaving the settling unit and that will be your net growth

<ICE-SIN:S1B-011#49:1>
So now we come back to the assumptions we say we usually make

<ICE-SIN:S1B-011#50:1>
Assuming cell concentration and inflow is zero i-e x-y is zero

<ICE-SIN:S1B-011#51:1>
Steady state the x vility is zero then this means this is zero this
is zero and simplifies to you just bring over this side you get this
expression here equals to v multiplied by r-g prime r-g prime being your next
specific uh your net growth your net ah bacterial growth rate alright

<ICE-SIN:S1B-011#52:1>
And of course your r-g prime is equals to this expression here
without the x term

<ICE-SIN:S1B-011#53:1>
So if you divide by d-x and if you look at this term here and what we
define as one over teta c in the previous transparency this actually would be
one over teta c alright

<ICE-SIN:S1B-011#54:1>
In the previous transparency this term here the left hand side term
is one over teta c

<ICE-SIN:S1B-011#55:1>
For substituting of teta c the one over teta c is equals to this
expression or teta c is y-u minus k-d and if you recall the previous
treatment teta c one over teta c is ec of exactly the same expression

<ICE-SIN:S1B-011#56:1>
For the case of a CSTR without recycle

<ICE-SIN:S1B-011#57:1>
Again the expression is exactly the same whether or not here is
recycle

<ICE-SIN:S1B-011#58:1>
Of course the difference now is how you calculate teta c because now
one over teta c is not for teta c is not the same as teta

<ICE-SIN:S1B-011#59:1>
In a case where there is no recycle right

<ICE-SIN:S1B-011#60:1>
So that's <unclear> word </unclear>

<ICE-SIN:S1B-011#61:1>
Otherwise expression is really the same and substituting your
substrate utilisation your your utilisa your substrate utilisation rate to
this expression

<ICE-SIN:S1B-011#62:1>
You can get your effluent concentration so your your concentration
within the reactor x and of course in the case where there is no recycle

<ICE-SIN:S1B-011#63:1>
These two terms are the same you cancel out and that will be the term
that will be the expression you have seen earlier okay

<ICE-SIN:S1B-011#64:1>
I repeat if there is no recycle teta c equals to teta you cancel out
so you you see the expression earlier as well

<ICE-SIN:S1B-011#65:1>
Any any question as far Okay now this expression actually would
suggest that uh this expression it would suggest that if you reduce the
hydraulic retention time then your m-l-v-x-s or your x value here would
increase in the reactor right

<ICE-SIN:S1B-011#66:1>
Does it not suggest that

<ICE-SIN:S1B-011#67:1>
If you increase your hydraulic retention time teta which is v over q
then x will increase assuming everything else remains constant alright

<ICE-SIN:S1B-011#68:1>
But of course there's a limit to to this because if you were to
decrease your hydraulic so if you were to increase your hydraulic retention
time rather if you de if you decrease your hydraulic retention time x will
increase

<ICE-SIN:S1B-011#69:1>
But if you decrease your hydraulic retention time it also means your
cells are to be more liable to be washed out alright

<ICE-SIN:S1B-011#70:1>
Hydraulic retention time decreases such that it approximates your
cell regeneration time then your cells will be liable to be washed off right

<ICE-SIN:S1B-011#71:1>
Once your cells are washed out then your s is going to approximate s
nought which means you're going to have virtually very little treatment right

<ICE-SIN:S1B-011#72:1>
But of course I said if you in if you decrease teta c teta rather and
everything el everything else is held constant but of course you know that
cannot be true because if you were to decrease if you were to decrease teta c
teta rather teta c will also be affected right

<ICE-SIN:S1B-011#73:1>
Do you recall the definition of teta teta being v over q v is
constant so to decrease this that means you must increase your flow rate q
right

<ICE-SIN:S1B-011#74:1>
If you increase your flow rate q teta c would also change in fact
teta c would decrease as well alright

<ICE-SIN:S1B-011#75:1>
So we we look at this case where the cells are wasted from the
reactor as I said the other arrangement which is actually more typical would
be like your cells or your sludge wasted from the settling tank

<ICE-SIN:S1B-011#76:1>
So this second arrangement is actually the more common arrangement
alright

<ICE-SIN:S1B-011#77:1>
Now instead of a cells being wasted from your reactor now it's taken
out from your settling unit

<ICE-SIN:S1B-011#78:1>
So redefining the terms slightly we've got this prime here we can
then applying the same definition <unclear> word </unclear> just see for this
case

<ICE-SIN:S1B-011#79:1>
This is the mass of cells in the reactor

<ICE-SIN:S1B-011#80:1>
Of course that's the same mass of cells wasted per day

<ICE-SIN:S1B-011#81:1>
This time this would be the mass of cells that is wasted from your
settling unit that will be the amount leaving your settling unit alright

<ICE-SIN:S1B-011#82:1>
So distance here will be changed slightly

<ICE-SIN:S1B-011#83:1>
Again assuming x-e is very small then it simplifies the this
expression

<ICE-SIN:S1B-011#84:1>
So to calculate x which is your concentration of your ah cells within
the reactor

<ICE-SIN:S1B-011#85:1>
It's the same expression as you've seen before same expression except
that now teta c takes a different expression alright

<ICE-SIN:S1B-011#86:1>
I have discussed only about x so far

<ICE-SIN:S1B-011#87:1>
What about your substrate concentration or your B-O-D which is s

<ICE-SIN:S1B-011#88:1>
We can do likewise

<ICE-SIN:S1B-011#89:1>
Do a substrate balance okay

<ICE-SIN:S1B-011#90:1>
Do a mass balance for the substrate now for your <unclear> word
</unclear> system

<ICE-SIN:S1B-011#91:1>
Then you have the x vitity or divide by v q-s nought which is the
substrate coming into the system

<ICE-SIN:S1B-011#92:1>
The same thing whatever substrate leaves the system and whatever is
consumed here you can do the same thing and try to get an expression for s
alright

<ICE-SIN:S1B-011#93:1>
Any question so far

<ICE-SIN:S1B-011#94:1>
Okay if not with that I'd like to cover our secondary treatment and I
want to move on next to discuss about tertiary treatment systems or what is
commonly termed also advanced waste water treatment

<ICE-SIN:S1B-011#95:1>
Okay now treat water treatment

<ICE-SIN:S1B-011#96:1>
Now although secondary treatment purposes may reduce more than
eighty-five percent of B-O-D or suspended solids or possibly even more than
eighty-five percent and also nearly all pathogens are removed

<ICE-SIN:S1B-011#97:1>
If you recall we introduce disinfectants disinfectants

<ICE-SIN:S1B-011#98:1>
However only a mi only minor removal of some pollutants is achieved

<ICE-SIN:S1B-011#99:1>
Okay examples of some pollutants of concern because there's only
minor removal will be things like your nutrients <unclear> word </unclear>
nitrogen phospherous colloidal particles refractory organics dissolved
inorganic solids

<ICE-SIN:S1B-011#100:1>
So these are some of the pollutants that are of concern because
after secondary treatment you may have only removed uh a very small
percentage

<ICE-SIN:S1B-011#101:1>
Now addition treatment used to remove these pollutants are termed
advanced waste water treatment or AW-T or tertiary treatment and in order to
in relation to solving these tough pollution problems i-e taking care of
these alright the processes the processes will will be effluent quality to
the point that it may be adequate for many reuse purposes alright

<ICE-SIN:S1B-011#102:1>
So it will convert what will otherwise be a waste water to a
valuable resource

<ICE-SIN:S1B-011#103:1>
I think in the case of Singapore this is particularly relevant
alright because we are relying on water from our neighbours

<ICE-SIN:S1B-011#104:1>
So this is something of uh relevance in effect it's not only of
relevance but importance as well

<ICE-SIN:S1B-011#105:1>
Actually recently there was an MOU signed between NUS and ENV

<ICE-SIN:S1B-011#106:1>
That's Ministry of Environment and amongst the projects we're
looking into would be one which we call uh technology development for water
renovation <X>

<ICE-SIN:S1B-011#X107:1>
Well in a nutshell it's A-W-T

<ICE-SIN:S1B-011#X108:1>
All we're trying to do is to recover or reuse our waste water so
that they can be recycled back to the industry and be reused alright </X>
