Hi I'm Lisa welcome to Hey Singapore

<ICE-SIN:S2B-027#2:1:A>
As Singapore develops many physical traces of the past are slowly
being erased

<ICE-SIN:S2B-027#3:1:A>
HDB flats have long taken over kampongs and large expanses of parks
have replaced the swamps and forests

<ICE-SIN:S2B-027#4:1:A>
Yet despite the changes modernisation haven't totally removed all
the traces of the past

<ICE-SIN:S2B-027#5:1:A>
Traces of the solitary tombs for example scattered throughout the
island are single and sometimes totally abandoned tombs

<ICE-SIN:S2B-027#6:1:A>
Tombs like this one here at Monk's Hill and another at Radin Mas

<ICE-SIN:S2B-027#7:1:A>
Who are buried here and why haven't they been removed

<ICE-SIN:S2B-027#8:1:A>
Tonight on Hey Singapore the mystery of the solitary tombs

<ICE-SIN:S2B-027#9:1:A>
Look hard enough around Singapore and you may come across solitary
tombs

<ICE-SIN:S2B-027#10:1:A>
Some of these are well-known and well documented like this one here
at Outram Road

<ICE-SIN:S2B-027#11:1:A>
It belongs to Tan Tock Seng and for years it has remained
undisturbed

<ICE-SIN:S2B-027#12:1:A>
Another solitary tomb that is slightly more well-known can be fond
here at Fort Canning

<ICE-SIN:S2B-027#13:1:A>
As to whose remains it holds well that's a bit of a controversy
though it's believed to be Iskandar Shah's

<ICE-SIN:S2B-027#14:1:A>
Last season we dug up some facts about this tomb here at Stevens
Road and we put to rest the much believed rumour that it held Raffles'
mistress' remains and tonight we go in search of more solitary tombs

<ICE-SIN:S2B-027#15:1:A>
Our search led us to yet another solitary tomb in the Monk's Hill
area

<ICE-SIN:S2B-027#16:1:A>
This is where Monk's Hill School is located but little is known
about how the place got its name

<ICE-SIN:S2B-027#17:1:A>
Perhaps it was named after a monk who may have once lived in this
area or for a temple that may have once stood here

<ICE-SIN:S2B-027#18:1:A>
We headed to the present temple in the area

<ICE-SIN:S2B-027#19:1:A>
Perhaps someone here could shed light on a rumoured old temple

<ICE-SIN:S2B-027#20:1:A>
Unfortunately the caretaker was not around to answer our questions

<ICE-SIN:S2B-027#21:1:A>
Next to the temple was a mechanic's workshop and one of the staff
there led us to what he believed to be the remains of a person who may have
stayed in the old temple

<ICE-SIN:S2B-027#22:1:A>
It was an abandoned tombstone that was surrounded almost wrapped by
a tree

<ICE-SIN:S2B-027#23:1:A>
We couldn't make out the inscription on the tomb nor can we find
any clues that might tell us of the tomb was connected to a temple that was
said to exist in the area hence the name Monk's Hill

<ICE-SIN:S2B-027#24:1:A>
Nobody at the workshop could tell us more so we looked for the
owner of the plot of land

<ICE-SIN:S2B-027#25:1:A>
The address was 147 Bukit Timah Road but our search came to nought

<ICE-SIN:S2B-027#26:1:A>
We were unable to locate the owner of the land or the owner of the
workshop

<ICE-SIN:S2B-027#27:1:A>
Our next step was to find our tomb maker friend Mr Yeo

<ICE-SIN:S2B-027#28:1:A>
He had helped us with some interesting leads with our investigation
of the tomb along Stevens Road

<ICE-SIN:S2B-027#29:1:A>
We hoped he will be able to shed some light on this mystery tomb as
well

<ICE-SIN:S2B-027#30:1:A>
He wasted no time in trying to decipher the characters on the stone

<ICE-SIN:S2B-027#31:1:A>
We hoped it would tell us more about the temple that was believed
to be on the hill where Outram Secondary and Monk's Hill Secondary Schools
once stood

<ICE-SIN:S2B-027#32:1:A>
We able to decipher four distinct Chinese characters

<ICE-SIN:S2B-027#33:1:A>
Mr Yeo explained that they were time references based on the
reigning monarch in imperial China

<ICE-SIN:S2B-027#34:1:A>
To pinpoint the date he would need to consult a periodical of the
Chinese calendar

<ICE-SIN:S2B-027#35:1:A>
Next he tried to read the name inscribed on the tombstone

<ICE-SIN:S2B-027#36:1:A>
This proved difficult because of the tree

<ICE-SIN:S2B-027#37:1:A>
The roots have enveloped the tombstone covering all the
inscriptions but we had to get to the root of our mystery tree or no tree

<ICE-SIN:S2B-027#38:1:A>
We tried to scratch away some of the soil that had settled in but
that did not help much either

<ICE-SIN:S2B-027#39:1:A>
Slowly and very painstakingly Mr Yeo managed to finally uncover
most of the inscribed name

<ICE-SIN:S2B-027#40:1:A>
The first and last character on the tombstone were Tan and Teck

<ICE-SIN:S2B-027#41:1:A>
Mr Yeo then moved on to the tomb's features to see if he can come
up with even more clues

<ICE-SIN:S2B-027#42:1:A>
In the meantime our research assistant Kai Lin adamantly kept
trying to read the missing part of the inscription

<ICE-SIN:S2B-027#43:1:A>
Initially Mr Yeo thought that the granite used might be from Pulau
Ubin where Singapore's early granite came from but after further inspection
he came up with a discovery that baffled us

<ICE-SIN:S2B-027#44:1:A>
The rocks used were not from Pulau Ubin but from Mandai which
pre-dated the quarry on Pulau Ubin

<ICE-SIN:S2B-027#45:1:A>
This also means that the tomb was built even before the nineteen
hundreds

<ICE-SIN:S2B-027#46:1:A>
According to Mr Yeo they aren't many tombstones in Singapore that
pre-date the twentieth century

<ICE-SIN:S2B-027#47:1:A>
This finding coupled with Kai Lin's deciphering of the second
character on the tombstone He spur us on

<ICE-SIN:S2B-027#48:1:A>
Mr Yeo also gave us other clues as to who might be in the tomb

<ICE-SIN:S2B-027#49:1:A>
He confirmed that it was the tomb of a male of Teochew origin

<ICE-SIN:S2B-027#50:1:A>
This was based on the outer rim marking guarding the tomb with
<unclear> word </unclear> markers

<ICE-SIN:S2B-027#51:1:A>
According to Mr Yeo the <unclear> word </unclear> could also mean
that the male buried here was a scholar and not a monk

<ICE-SIN:S2B-027#52:1:A>
In the course of our story we came up with many conflicting views

<ICE-SIN:S2B-027#53:1:A>
Some said that there was never a temple on Monk's Hill while others
not only claimed there was but that it was re-sited from Newton Circus and
those who lived here before claimed that the whole place was nothing but a
rubber plantation

<ICE-SIN:S2B-027#54:1:A>
If all this is true then Monk's Hill may never have been the result
of a monastery that was said to have been situated here

<ICE-SIN:S2B-027#55:1:A>
More questions about this tomb when we come back

<ICE-SIN:S2B-027#56:1:A>
Back in his workshop Mr Yeo showed us the shape of a typical
Teochew tombstone

<ICE-SIN:S2B-027#57:1:A>
True enough it did look like the tombstone we just saw

<ICE-SIN:S2B-027#58:1:A>
Next he showed us a Chinese calendar which not only showed the
years according to the <unclear> word </unclear> calendar correlated with the
Cninese Zodiac calendar but also the reigning monarchs in imperial China

<ICE-SIN:S2B-027#59:1:A>
Based on this calendar Mr Yeo was able to pinpoint that the person
buried in the tombstone died in 1873

<ICE-SIN:S2B-027#60:1:A>
On a subsequent visit to the temple we met an old man who live in
the temple

<ICE-SIN:S2B-027#61:1:A>
He only wanted to be known as Lim

<ICE-SIN:S2B-027#62:1:A>
He provided us more answers to our mystery but took us further from
our original premise that Monk's Hill was named after a temple

<ICE-SIN:S2B-027#63:1:A>
According to him the temple we spoke of was only built in the
nineteen fifties

<ICE-SIN:S2B-027#64:1:A>
Where the petrol kiosk now stand was a kampong area and behind it a
private garden

<ICE-SIN:S2B-027#65:1:A>
He had never heard of a temple in the vicinity

<ICE-SIN:S2B-027#66:1:A>
When asked about the tomb he couldn't say who it belong to but what
he revealed took us by surprise

<ICE-SIN:S2B-027#67:1:A>
Under these two burned offering areas were two other tombs marked
by these joss-sticks

<ICE-SIN:S2B-027#68:1:A>
And there was a third tomb just a metre away again marked
joss-sticks

<ICE-SIN:S2B-027#69:1:A>
We speculated that these tombs could have been for those who were
connected with the temple in some way but we were to be proven wrong

<ICE-SIN:S2B-027#70:1:A>
Mr Tan Peck Chew used to be a resident of the kampong but what he
told us shed even more doubt than light on our temple theory

<ICE-SIN:S2B-027#71:1:A>
According to Mr Tan the temple now standing was not part of any
bigger temple in the area

<ICE-SIN:S2B-027#72:1:A>
It was moved over in the nineteen fifties from a shrine that was
found under a tree at Newton Circus

<ICE-SIN:S2B-027#73:1:A>
To his earliest recollection there was never a temple in the area
where the school now stands it was in fact a plantation

<ICE-SIN:S2B-027#74:1:A>
We asked Mr Tan if he had seen the tomb before it was covered up by
the tree

<ICE-SIN:S2B-027#75:1:A>
He couln't remember the full name of the man buried in the burial
plot

<ICE-SIN:S2B-027#76:1:A>
According to him the man was very rich and had his entire family
buried in the same area

<ICE-SIN:S2B-027#77:1:A>
The two tombs covered over by the temple was smaller tombs and were
those of his two servants

<ICE-SIN:S2B-027#78:1:A>
There was another tomb in which his wife was buried and that tomb
is completely hidden by this massive tree

<ICE-SIN:S2B-027#79:1:A>
Well our search for how Monk's Hill got its name uncovered more
questions than answers

<ICE-SIN:S2B-027#80:1:A>
One thing's for sure this is not a monk's tomb or was Monk's Hill
really named after a temple

<ICE-SIN:S2B-027#81:1:A>
If so why are there no records of this temple

<ICE-SIN:S2B-027#82:1:A>
Our trace at the National Archive also came to nought as none of
the early maps of Singapore seem to mark the presense of a temple and both Mr
Lim and Mr Tan were quite sure that there was never a temple in the vicinity

<ICE-SIN:S2B-027#83:1:A>
If it was a temple then could it have been named after a rich
landowner and what are the tombstones

<ICE-SIN:S2B-027#84:1:A>
Whose was it

<ICE-SIN:S2B-027#85:1:A>
Given the grandeur of its original design could it have been the
tomb of somebody influential

<ICE-SIN:S2B-027#86:1:A>
Well one thing's for certain the person this tomb belongs to was
not the reason for this place being called Monk's Hill

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S2B-027#87:1:B>
From Monk's Hill we now go to Radin Mas

<ICE-SIN:S2B-027#88:1:B>
There are some stories about Radin Mas which apparently date back a
thousand years

<ICE-SIN:S2B-027#89:1:B>
Yet others say that the actual history of Radin Mas only began a
hundred years ago

<ICE-SIN:S2B-027#90:1:B>
The stories that revolved around Radin Mas have many
interpretations but the one that stands out most has to be the golden
princess

<ICE-SIN:S2B-027#91:1:B>
So it's the golden princess fact or myth

<ICE-SIN:S2B-027#92:1:B>
This sprawling kampong was named after a tomb

<ICE-SIN:S2B-027#93:1:B>
Many versions of the forklore have surrounded how kampong Radin Mas
got its name

<ICE-SIN:S2B-027#94:1:B>
They range from those that say Radin Mas was a beautiful Javanese
princess who was killed while trying to save her father Tun Radin Mas the
devout Muslim of royal blood

<ICE-SIN:S2B-027#95:1:B>
We went in search of the true story of Radin Mas

<ICE-SIN:S2B-027#96:1:B>
Mr Haji <unclear> word </unclear> a leader of the <unclear> word
</unclear> mosque near Radin Mas told us what he knew

<ICE-SIN:S2B-027#97:1:B>
Mr Haji <unclear> word </unclear> account of Radin Mas is by and
far the most widely accepted one that Radin Mas was a Javanese princess from
the <unclear> word </unclear> era and was killed protecting her father

<ICE-SIN:S2B-027#98:1:B>
But there was still many questions that needed answers so we went
up to Radin Mas' burial ground to see if there were any clues which we could
unearthed

<ICE-SIN:S2B-027#99:1:B>
The grounds was still well-maintained

<ICE-SIN:S2B-027#100:1:B>
It was obvious that there were still people who came up to pray at
this <unclear> word </unclear>

<ICE-SIN:S2B-027#101:1:B>
However we could not find the caretaker of the place

<ICE-SIN:S2B-027#102:1:B>
Some people we had asked earlier including Mr Haji <unclear> word
</unclear> told us that the caretaker was from Indonesia and doesn't live
here anymore others said he died

<ICE-SIN:S2B-027#103:1:B>
But all this did not answer our questions

<ICE-SIN:S2B-027#104:1:B>
Who has been taking care of this place

<ICE-SIN:S2B-027#105:1:B>
The tomb itself was found under a huge hollow tree and the tomb
markers are wrapped in royal yellow cloth

<ICE-SIN:S2B-027#106:1:B>
On our way down from the <unclear> word </unclear> we also noticed
a smaller burial plot

<ICE-SIN:S2B-027#107:1:B>
The tombstone markers was also wrapped in royal cloth

<ICE-SIN:S2B-027#108:1:B>
We asked Mr Haji <unclear> word </unclear> who it was for

<ICE-SIN:S2B-027#109:1:B>
We were not convinced that that was all to the story of Radin Mas

<ICE-SIN:S2B-027#110:1:B>
One of her links to <unclear> word </unclear>

<ICE-SIN:S2B-027#111:1:B>
Now this was recorded in the history books

<ICE-SIN:S2B-027#112:1:B>
It was at this mosque that we were able to find new answers and a
whole new story about the life of Radin Mas

<ICE-SIN:S2B-027#113:1:B>
We met Mr Haji Abu <unclear> word </unclear> who was the leader of
the mosque

<ICE-SIN:S2B-027#114:1:B>
Like all our other leads he was reluctant at first to tell us more
about the story of Radin Mas but after much persuasion he told us the story
through our interpreter Mohammed

<ICE-SIN:S2B-027#115:1:B>
According to him Radin Mas was not a princess but a commoner who
was a concubine of Tunku <unclear> word </unclear>

<ICE-SIN:S2B-027#116:1:B>
They lived in the late nineteen century

<ICE-SIN:S2B-027#117:1:B>
This tally with some of the historical records which tied Radin
Mas to one Tunku <unclear> word </unclear> who died in the nineteen hundreds

<ICE-SIN:S2B-027#118:1:B>
They lived in the royal palace which is where the old Radin Mas
Primary School stood <X>

<ICE-SIN:S2B-027#X119:1:B>
What Mr <unclear> word </unclear> went on to tell us was even
more shocking

<ICE-SIN:S2B-027#X120:1:B>
Radin Mas was not accorded with any official status because she
was a concubine that is not legally married to the Tunku

<ICE-SIN:S2B-027#X121:1:B>
This explains why her tomb lies near Mount Faber while the rest
of the royal family were buried in the royal burial plot of Telok Blangah
Road

<ICE-SIN:S2B-027#X122:1:B>
The story was a total turn-around from the other stories that we
heard about Radin Mas

<ICE-SIN:S2B-027#X123:1:B>
Mr Haji <unclear> word </unclear> also did not recall any story
of her sacrificing her life for a father </X> </I>
