<ICE-SIN:W2F-019#1:1>
<h> Opening time </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2F-019#2:1>
Father Luigi stands at his end of the bar-counter, wiping the
wine-glasses, always the man of the cloth.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-019#3:1>
Even with my face to the mahogany of the counter-top, I know that he
is watching me with his old brown eyes.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-019#4:1>
He watches over me, the Padre, because he knows what I come here for.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-019#5:1>
I come to his altar rail seeking the solace of his pasta and wine, and
for communion with another human being, the listening ear of my friend.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-019#6:1>
Forgive me Father, for I have sinned.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-019#7:1>
I have loved a woman.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-019#8:1>
That was Father Luigi's sin too, and that is why I come to him to make
my confessions.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-019#9:1>
He understands.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-019#10:1>
He threw in the cloth for a soprano in his parish choir.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-019#11:1>
Like a siren song, her voice led him to run his soul aground.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-019#12:1>
And she never married him.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-019#13:1>
She finally sold herself to an MBA with the scion of a wealthy
towkay.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-019#14:1>
" A hard habit to break," the Padre always says of communions and
confessions at his bar-counter.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-019#15:1>
But there is comfort in that, of course.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-019#16:1>
Your confessions are safe with the Padre.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-019#17:1>
He will bear your burden of secrecy.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-019#18:1>
And so, when the half-light falls, I mount my Lady of the Knight and
ride from the Ridge to the Ville and the Last Chance Cafe.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-019#19:1>
Father Luigi's prices are alright.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-019#20:1>
Four dollars for a sinner's dinner of spaghetti or lasagna and an
extra dollar for the wine; and if you plan on staying after dinner, bring a
pocketful of change for the jukebox.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-019#21:1>
I always stay for supper, so after dinner, I bring the wine over to
the bar-counter to chat a bit with the Padre.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-019#22:1>
Then I move off to make space for the new repentants and repeat
offenders.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-019#23:1>
The Padre has already heard my confession.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-019#24:1>
There is a dark little corner near the jukebox and it is there that I
often sit with my head against the wall, with the grinning skull that is my
bike helmet, feeding the polished chrome and glaring neon of the jukebox,
finding my psalms in the rock and roll.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-019#25:1>
I can quote those songs chapter and verse for you.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-019#26:1>
And lately, that is what I have been doing here most nights.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-019#27:1>
By the dim glow of an old-fashioned brass oil lamp, I try to put my
heart on paper, like the psalmists of the Good Book and the psalmists running
around at 45 rpm in the jukebox, as if doing so might purge me of my sin and
guilt.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-019#28:1>
Two other things rest on the checkered table-cloth, beside a shabby
notebook and my battered old Parker.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-019#29:1>
One is a slim stack of letters.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-019#30:1>
The other is my wallet, opened like a Pandora's box with a haunting
black and white photo of a girl with a hesitant smile, like a virgin bride on
her wedding night.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-019#31:1>
It is not easy, trying to make a reality from words, from a memory I
often wish had only stayed a dream.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-019#32:1>
But I have never heard a song that could say everything I felt about
Ariel.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-019#33:1>
This is Ariel's song then, and I hope you will forgive me this
indulgence which the good Padre has not been guilty of selling me.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-019#34:1>
And is not forgiveness all that matters in the end?

<ICE-SIN:W2F-019#35:1>
Father, please hear my confession.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-019#36:1>
0000 hours

<ICE-SIN:W2F-019#37:1>
" My darling Puck,

<ICE-SIN:W2F-019#38:1>
I'm writing this on the plane.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-019#39:1>
It's dark outside and I can't sleep.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-019#40:1>
It feels so funny, to be here, when only last night we were together.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-019#41:1>
I miss you already.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-019#42:1>
Hope you miss me too.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-019#43:1>
Wish you were here, because I'm really scared.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-019#44:1>
Wouldn't you be scared too if you had to leave everything and
everyone you've known and go some place you've never been?

<ICE-SIN:W2F-019#45:1>
But if you say it's best, I suppose it will be okay.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-019#46:1>
I still don't want to go, but I know that if I don't, you won't be
mine for long anyway.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-019#47:1>
You don't have to explain.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-019#48:1>
I understand.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-019#49:1>
And I forgive you.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-019#50:1>
Well, at least there is still a chance things will work out for us.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-019#51:1>
I shall write again, once I've seen my first New Zealand sunrise ..."

<ICE-SIN:W2F-019#52:1>
Corridors are lit by the cold grey-green of fluorescent tubes.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-019#53:1>
But the light in the darkened room seems blue, blue-dark like the
midnight sky.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-019#54:1>
There are a few stars, a sickle-moon, trails of night-grey clouds
caught on its points.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-019#55:1>
Beyond the blinds of the room, the lights that line the footpath burn
yellow-orange.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-019#56:1>
My father had held up his hand once in that yellow-orange light and
said, son, this is the colour of a dead man's hand.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-019#57:1>
I had never seen a dead man, so I agreed.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-019#58:1>
But I know better now.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-019#59:1>
Dead men are grey-green.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-019#60:1>
I had held my father's hand in the grey-green flourescence of a
mortuary.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-019#61:1>
A soft hand is slipped into mine, fingers long and smooth, curling
around my own, roughened by the knurled grips of tools and motorcycle oil.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-019#62:1>
Her hair is soft against my arm, long and black in the night, as she
leans on me.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-019#63:1>
" Don't look out the window.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-019#64:1>
Look at me," she says.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-019#65:1>
I turn to face her.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-019#66:1>
She has a beautiful face, ghostly blue-white in the night, but to
kiss her is to know that this is no porcelain-face of a harlequin.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-019#67:1>
Her lips are warm, cheeks soft and getting warmer as the blood rushes
to her face.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-019#68:1>
She is wearing no make-up and my tongue tip finds her lips only
faintly sweet.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-019#69:1>
Her hands are on my neck, stroking and then running into my hair,
pulling back and I feel the electric tug against the roots.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-019#70:1>
She pulls away, head bent down.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-019#71:1>
Pulling her to me, her breasts are soft against my chest.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-019#72:1>
I can feel her heart beating.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-019#73:1>
Her arms grow tight around me and she is crying.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-019#74:1>
" I don't want to go"

<ICE-SIN:W2F-019#75:1>
" But you must"

<ICE-SIN:W2F-019#76:1>
" Must I?"

<ICE-SIN:W2F-019#77:1>
" We've been through this before, Ariel," I remind her gently.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-019#78:1>
For your own good, darling.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-019#79:1>
Or for mine.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-019#80:1>
Somewhere at the back of my mind are the beginnings of guilt.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-019#81:1>
I can't fit you into my life.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-019#82:1>
It sounds so brutal, but even then, the words are not mine.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-019#83:1>
Someone said them to me once, when I was a boy of seventeen.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-019#84:1>
I never thought I'd hear those words from me.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-019#85:1>
She must never hear them.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-019#86:1>
They would hurt too much.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-019#87:1>
Yet, perhaps she already knows.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-019#88:1>
" But I love you," she whispers, her voice almost inaudible.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-019#89:1>
She does not want me to hear the breaking in her voice.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-019#90:1>
She is a proud girl.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-019#91:1>
" And I love you too."

<ICE-SIN:W2F-019#92:1>
" Then why?"

<ICE-SIN:W2F-019#93:1>
" Ariel"

<ICE-SIN:W2F-019#94:1>
" I'm sorry"

<ICE-SIN:W2F-019#95:1>
" Remember your promise?"

<ICE-SIN:W2F-019#96:1>
" Yes.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-019#97:1>
I will remember.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-019#98:1>
I promise to try to be happy and give myself a chance to live all
over again"

<ICE-SIN:W2F-019#99:1>
" Good girl"

<ICE-SIN:W2F-019#100:1>
She fits so well in my arms, it is almost like she was made to be
there.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-019#101:1>
There is a sense of wholeness, of completeness for me that I have
never felt in my life.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-019#102:1>
Why am I sending you away, Ariel?

<ICE-SIN:W2F-019#103:1>
But no, my reason tells me we could be happy now, but not for
always.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-019#104:1>
What was the reason I had been given as a seventeen year old boy?

<ICE-SIN:W2F-019#105:1>
We come from different worlds, Puck.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-019#106:1>
We come from different worlds, Ariel.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-019#107:1>
I went into yours for a while and found you and could not bear to
leave you behind.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-019#108:1>
So I took you back to mine.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-019#109:1>
And found I could not fit you into my life.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-019#110:1>
Am I a bastard for doing that?

<ICE-SIN:W2F-019#111:1>
" Will we ever see each other again?"

<ICE-SIN:W2F-019#112:1>
" Yes, Ariel.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-019#113:1>
But you mustn't come back here for quite a while.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-019#114:1>
I shall go to you"

<ICE-SIN:W2F-019#115:1>
" Then this is the last time we have together?"

<ICE-SIN:W2F-019#116:1>
" For the time being"

<ICE-SIN:W2F-019#117:1>
She looks at me with those eyes that say so much, everything I want
to hear, everything I don't.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-019#118:1>
" Will you?"

<ICE-SIN:W2F-019#119:1>
" Will I what, girl?"

<ICE-SIN:W2F-019#120:1>
" Will you make love to me then?"

<ICE-SIN:W2F-019#121:1>
She has been in this room for a fortnight with me, but I have never
touched her, not that way.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-019#122:1>
Again, I do not really know why.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-019#123:1>
She has a sleek, tight, Reebok-trim body and we have shared this
bed, she, sleeping like a baby, head beneath my chin.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-019#124:1>
She has a hurt look of rejection now and I can guess what is going
through her mind.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-019#125:1>
You do not want to make love to me because of what I've been.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-019#126:1>
She edges away but I bring her back.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-019#127:1>
" I do"

<ICE-SIN:W2F-019#128:1>
" You're not afraid of catching something from me?"

<ICE-SIN:W2F-019#129:1>
There is a touch of bitterness in her voice, but it is sad, resigned
to whatever answer I may give.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-019#130:1>
" I never was".

<ICE-SIN:W2F-019#131:1>
She pushes me away to arm's length and looks at me for a moment.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-019#132:1>
Then without another word, she pulls her tee-shirt over her head.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-019#133:1>
It is mine really and I watch the words, National University of
Singapore, disappear as the shirt is turned inside out.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-019#134:1>
She shakes her hair loose and they fall in front of her breasts,
covering the mounds reflecting the blue-white light of the night.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-019#135:1>
Gently, I push her down and her hair falls like a black shower,
spread out on the pillow.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-019#136:1>
She tilts her chin up, offering her lips to me.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-019#137:1>
I feel their warmth and sweetness again as we press hard against
each other, as if it were possible to get any closer, and I understand at
last, the meaning of the words, 'and they were made one flesh'.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-019#138:1>
0100 hours

<ICE-SIN:W2F-019#139:1>
" ...I've seen it!

<ICE-SIN:W2F-019#140:1>
The sunrise here is so lovely and I'm going to make it a point to
wake up every morning to see it.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-019#141:1>
Aunt Emma and Uncle Bob were at the airport to pick me up.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-019#142:1>
You're right, they are very nice people.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-019#143:1>
They've given me a room of my own and the windows face the east,
that's how I get to watch the sun.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-019#144:1>
Remember how we used to ride down to the sea in the mornings just to
watch the sun together?

<ICE-SIN:W2F-019#145:1>
I think of you now whenever I see the sunrise.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-019#146:1>
It's a nice feeling I get, but after that, it's always a bit sad
because I do miss you.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-019#147:1>
When will you come to watch a sunrise with me?

<ICE-SIN:W2F-019#148:1>
..."

<ICE-SIN:W2F-019#149:1>
She is asleep with the night, but I am awake to look at her, to fix
her in my mind and memory.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-019#150:1>
She seemed older when I first met her in person, but in the past few
weeks, the freshness I remember from long ago has been returning to her
cheeks.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-019#151:1>
But her eyes, and the way she looks at me, they have always been
that way.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-019#152:1>
They have never changed, haunting me once, haunting me still,
comforting, yet bringing back guilt...

<ICE-SIN:W2F-019#153:1>
We met in a rusty metal cupboard, oxidation painted over with olive
drab.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-019#154:1>
I was nineteen and on a level of hell called Tekong.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-019#155:1>
She was a pin-up girl, blutacked to the cupboard door below the
mirror, left there by the guy before me.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-019#156:1>
I had been about to take her black and white picture down and
replace her with a dolly of my own, in colour so real I could see breasts
heaving.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-019#157:1>
Then her eyes had caught mine; her face, her neck, the bit of chest
that showed through black lace, the shoulders brought up and front, the
fragile hands, lit luminous white against the folds of her dress, light
catching in her back-blown hair like a halo against the darkness behind her.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-019#158:1>
But her eyes, and the uncertain smile, made her look more virginal
than sensual and it made me want to protect her, not rape her.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-019#159:1>
Looking at her again in the shuttered dimness of the room, I find
that the feeling has not changed.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-019#160:1>
She stayed and I grew to love her.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-019#161:1>
It was not hard.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-019#162:1>
There had been a previous love in college, but that living,
breathing girl had wanted something more than a living, breathing man. <X>

<ICE-SIN:W2F-019#X163:1>
So I had stuck belukar ferns into my heart and sold my soul to the
army, wet dream theme of idealistic little boys.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-019#X164:1>
Misdirected affection?

<ICE-SIN:W2F-019#X165:1>
Perhaps, but at the time it seemed like a good idea. </X> </I>
