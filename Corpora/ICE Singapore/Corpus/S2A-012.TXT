<ICE-SIN:S2A-012#1:1:A>
They tend to have an over dependence on Randy Lai which is very
very well shackle by Gerard Danker

<ICE-SIN:S2A-012#2:1:A>
He certainly think <unclear> word </unclear> also good running to
Teck Lan

<ICE-SIN:S2A-012#3:1:A>
He is left and a great chance now for Singapore

<ICE-SIN:S2A-012#4:1:A>
Good break Mohammad Noor going all the way through

<ICE-SIN:S2A-012#5:1:A>
It is saved somehow

<ICE-SIN:S2A-012#6:1:A>
It manages to <unclear> word </unclear> Vijayan

<ICE-SIN:S2A-012#7:1:A>
Dangerous play by Singapore I just for a minute it looked as though
Mohammad Noor Aram had weaved his way through for Singapore's fourth and his
second

<ICE-SIN:S2A-012#8:1:A>
It wasn't to be a mad in a mad scramble Indonesians got is cleared

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-012#9:1:B>
Singapore get a penalty corner

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-012#10:1:A>
And at the same time I think we are gonna have a break of play
right now

<ICE-SIN:S2A-012#11:1:A>
One of the Indonesians is down injured He is out of the picture at
the moment

<ICE-SIN:S2A-012#12:1:A>
There he is he is just coming in on the onto your screen

<ICE-SIN:S2A-012#13:1:A>
It is not clear what exactly happened I suppose the picture tells
the whole story Tayers Tobarick the player who has gone down and it looks
like a cramp

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-012#14:1:B>
The high intensity of the game I think uh some of players who
have by now want to feel some cramps creeping into them

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-012#15:1:A>
Well you did say a bit earlier Ranjid that the Indonesians
were slowing down a little and having over dependence on certain players

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-012#16:1:B>
Matthais is one of them actually

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-012#17:1:A>
But if we lose him it is going to be a blow unless see what
Singapore can do

<ICE-SIN:S2A-012#18:1:A>
They showed a corner

<ICE-SIN:S2A-012#19:1:A>
They didn't do too much in the first half Very unimpressive

<ICE-SIN:S2A-012#20:1:A>
Let's see whether they can improve that

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-012#21:1:B>
A shot there by Ibrahim back to Steve

<ICE-SIN:S2A-012#22:1:B>
Yes there it is well worth this time good

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-012#23:1:A>
In the nineteenth minute of this second half Singapore go four
one up

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-012#24:1:B>
And we will see the replay well

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-012#25:1:A>
The initial shot was blocked but it was well played back

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-012#26:1:B>
Well taken shot by Rosli

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-012#27:1:A>
And it was Rosli Ahmad who somehow found his way

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-012#28:1:B>
Into the dee

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-012#29:1:A>
Into the dee all the way from his right back positions

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-012#30:1:B>
It actually shows the determination of the Singapore players
actually Bertrand hah to get into the action

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-012#31:1:A>
It does or perhaps Rosli was one of the uh key players on the

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-012#32:1:B>
short corner

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-012#33:1:A>
short corners

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-012#34:1:B>
Edwin trying to make his way around

<ICE-SIN:S2A-012#35:1:B>
Got the support of Mat Noor

<ICE-SIN:S2A-012#36:1:B>
Mat Noor will take a shot sixteen yard

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-012#37:1:A>
It says there by

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-012#38:1:B>
No long corner for Singapore

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-012#39:1:A>
Good try by Mohammad Noor he got his angles a bit wrong His
body was shaped the wrong way And as a result he couldn't get the shot on
target but if you don't shot you are never gonna score so it is encouraging
to see the Singapore players

<ICE-SIN:S2A-012#40:1:A>
Here is Dali again going all way and Edwin

<ICE-SIN:S2A-012#41:1:A>
Just too wide and Edwin throws his stick down in disgust

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-012#42:1:B>
That should have been a goal actually Edwin did very well to
turn his body around and put it pass the left post

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-012#43:1:A>
And Indonesia just can't get out of their own half at the
moment

<ICE-SIN:S2A-012#44:1:A>
Singapore mid-field has really taken a strangle hold on this game

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-012#45:1:B>
Actually they are playing brilliantly in the mid-field

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-012#46:1:A>
This is a good run though Excellent run

<ICE-SIN:S2A-012#47:1:A>
A chance for Indonesia Great play by Sunny

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-012#48:1:B>
Well played there by Eugene

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-012#49:1:A>
<unclear> word </unclear> by Gerard Danker That gives
Indonesia a short corner

<ICE-SIN:S2A-012#50:1:A>
That was a great save by Sunny and a one on one Indonesian player
was Rusmana number eight who managed to weave his way into the dee

<ICE-SIN:S2A-012#51:1:A>
He had Randy Lai free on the left side but he decided to go for the
goal and Sunny pulled off a great save

<ICE-SIN:S2A-012#52:1:A>
Singapore defenders too quick off the mark

<ICE-SIN:S2A-012#53:1:A>
This short corner is gonna be retaken and Randy Lai is poised to
take a shot

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-012#54:1:B>
Good stop Andy takes it stopped by Razah

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-012#55:1:A>
Well played by Razah

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-012#56:1:B>
Good touch on by Vijan to deny the Indonesian captain a chance

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-012#57:1:A>
Danger has passed temporarily

<ICE-SIN:S2A-012#58:1:A>
Well played by Randy Lai

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-012#59:1:B>
Obstruction says the umpire

<ICE-SIN:S2A-012#60:1:B>
It is a penalty corner for Indonesia again

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-012#61:1:A>
I think that was good play by Gerard Danker because Randy Lai
was lining up the shot

<ICE-SIN:S2A-012#62:1:A>
He didn't have much of a choice he had to step in

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-012#63:1:B>
Very well put Bertrand

<ICE-SIN:S2A-012#64:1:B>
Let's see if Indonesia can do something out of this short corner

<ICE-SIN:S2A-012#65:1:B>
Once again Rosdi Ahmad too fast faster than the pusher

<ICE-SIN:S2A-012#66:1:B>
Good hit there by Randy Randy just off the right post

<ICE-SIN:S2A-012#67:1:B>
Sunny was all stretched out afraid <unclear> word </unclear> by
Dali to keep that ball in he has given it to Ranjid going back to Daljid

<ICE-SIN:S2A-012#68:1:B>
They have to make their way down the right

<ICE-SIN:S2A-012#69:1:B>
Indonesians will put it to crutch for a free lead to Singapore

<ICE-SIN:S2A-012#70:1:B>
Singapore coach Graham Worth intending to give all players some
match experience giving Alman Koo which <unclear> word </unclear> for Foo
Yong Guan a run of the game

<ICE-SIN:S2A-012#71:1:B>
Well played by Ranjid on a bout <unclear> word </unclear> turn and
he gets a short corner

<ICE-SIN:S2A-012#72:1:B>
He will only drop his stick Ranji he might have got a penalty
stroke

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-012#73:1:A>
Well not very likely on that

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-012#74:1:B>
Who cares he tried his best

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-012#75:1:A>
But he showed good stick work though

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-012#76:1:B>
Singapore is a bit not too good in the short corner department

<ICE-SIN:S2A-012#77:1:B>
It has stopped good push Short corner

<ICE-SIN:S2A-012#78:1:B>
Edwin has got the ball out to Ranjid pretty well

<ICE-SIN:S2A-012#79:1:B>
He is only the hitter suppose to he seem a bit slow in stopping and
pushing the ball into the dee

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-012#80:1:A>
Ibrahim Teklan and it would be a shot at goal

<ICE-SIN:S2A-012#81:1:A>
Great big shot there Ibrahim Teklan Unstoppable

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-012#82:1:B>
But umpire's uh not giving the goal because uh

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-012#83:1:A>
Dangerous

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-012#84:1:B>
Dangerous play and he did not sound the ball so hard luck to
Ibrahim but a good shot there though

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-012#85:1:A>
Here we see a replay of it

<ICE-SIN:S2A-012#86:1:A>
Tremendous shot look at the power in there right in

<ICE-SIN:S2A-012#87:1:A>
Disallowed for dangerous play

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-012#88:1:B>
Singapore using the rollick substitution as their <unclear>
word </unclear> pullers

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-012#89:1:A>
Good dummy by Gerard Danker he left it for Ibrahim knowing
there was no Indonesian player in the Singapore half

<ICE-SIN:S2A-012#90:1:A>
This's Tah Lock it's a break on Indonesia

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-012#91:1:B>
The Indonesians stopped there by Ibrahim he gets a free hit
just outside the dee

<ICE-SIN:S2A-012#92:1:B>
He want to take a shot at goal stopped by Rosli this time

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-012#93:1:A>
Great stop by Rosli at point blank <unclear> word </unclear>

<ICE-SIN:S2A-012#94:1:A>
The number of times the break out <unclear> word </unclear>

<ICE-SIN:S2A-012#95:1:A>
They have to use Eugene who's overlapping who has held it up now

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-012#96:1:B>
Azak sending it out to Ranjid Ranjid

<ICE-SIN:S2A-012#97:1:B>
Umpire has given a long corner to Singapore

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-012#98:1:A>
Ranjid takes it to Ranjid

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-012#99:1:B>
Dropped by Ranjid in the sixteen yard hit

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-012#100:1:A>
Good defence play by Indonesians

<ICE-SIN:S2A-012#101:1:A>
Free hit to Singapore will be taken by Ranjid Singh the police

<ICE-SIN:S2A-012#102:1:A>
He looks for the top man and he finds Mohammad Noor

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-012#103:1:B>
Well shot his second goal for Singapore Very good goal

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-012#104:1:A>
Free hit laid in

<ICE-SIN:S2A-012#105:1:A>
Good stop by Mohammad Noor

<ICE-SIN:S2A-012#106:1:A>
Kept his eye on the ball and drilled in an excellent excellent
shot

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-012#107:1:B>
The thing about that shot is Betrand that he kept his eye on
the ball and that was very good of Mohammad Noor Brilliant goal

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-012#108:1:A>
It's taken Singapore is fifth

<ICE-SIN:S2A-012#109:1:A>
Vijay trying to play <unclear> word </unclear> Gets a long corner

<ICE-SIN:S2A-012#110:1:A>
Vijay sends his cross and he finds one of the <unclear> word
</unclear> of the day

<ICE-SIN:S2A-012#111:1:A>
Indonesian defenders and Singapore end up getting a penalty corner

<ICE-SIN:S2A-012#112:1:A>
And we have five minutes left and with this lead of five to one
the silver medal at least looks assured

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-012#113:1:B>
Yes Bertrand at this stage right now

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-012#114:1:A>
I think silver medal since hockey will there for men's hockey
there'll be only two medals gold and silver

<ICE-SIN:S2A-012#115:1:A>
Looks like Singapore will end up with a silver

<ICE-SIN:S2A-012#116:1:A>
Good play there nice tactic

<ICE-SIN:S2A-012#117:1:A>
Indonesians read it unless of course Singapore can beat Malaysian
which right now I don't think many people do expect that

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-012#118:1:B>
Uh not not at the world's ranking of Malaysia at number nine
in the world after the Olympics and what more

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-012#119:1:A>
But one never knows

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-012#120:1:B>
Bertrand the ball is round

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-012#121:1:A>
Like they say Malaysia obviously be the favourites but given
the home ground advantage and what support we can get from the crowd a draw
might be enough I mean think about it a draw with Malaysia and if somehow the
Indonesians can fend off the Malaysians those difference might be the key

<ICE-SIN:S2A-012#122:1:A>
Of course the question is whether five one is enough because
Malaysia obviously they're a much sharper team and could well wreck up a much
bigger score against Indonesians

<ICE-SIN:S2A-012#123:1:A>
Good play there by <unclear> word </unclear> Hassan

<ICE-SIN:S2A-012#124:1:A>
He's pulled it a bit too wide bring the ball out

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-012#125:1:B>
Indonesians looked like all finished but uh they might want
to try to put in a goal to save some credibility and it was Ibrahim Teklan
again to the rescue

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-012#126:1:A>
Caught in between the legs Ranjid

<ICE-SIN:S2A-012#127:1:A>
The Indonesians might try and wanna look for a goal right now to
save some

<ICE-SIN:S2A-012#128:1:A>
Indonesians playing the ball around not knowing what to do as
Singapore has got everybody back

<ICE-SIN:S2A-012#129:1:A>
Ibrahim now onto the captain's Suranto <unclear> word </unclear>

<ICE-SIN:S2A-012#130:1:A>
Well played Ibrahim startled Suranto Suranto still with the ball
<unclear> word </unclear> Singh on him

<ICE-SIN:S2A-012#131:1:A>
Bit of a stick tapping there Indonesians will pick up the free hit

<ICE-SIN:S2A-012#132:1:A>
Well played Talop to read that one <unclear> word </unclear>
Suhanto now

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-012#133:1:B>
Well cut off there by Razar <unclear> word </unclear> try to
keep the ball in play not successful

<ICE-SIN:S2A-012#134:1:B>
Suhanto again He trying to the cross in and give a long corner to
Indonesia

<ICE-SIN:S2A-012#135:1:B>
Good play by Danker

<ICE-SIN:S2A-012#136:1:B>
All the way down to the Indonesian half

<ICE-SIN:S2A-012#137:1:B>
Maybe a hit in for Indonesia

<ICE-SIN:S2A-012#138:1:B>
Good play by Razak

<ICE-SIN:S2A-012#139:1:B>
Ranjid has it on the right now

<ICE-SIN:S2A-012#140:1:B>
Razak's just thrown the ball wide on the right nobody picking it
up

<ICE-SIN:S2A-012#141:1:B>
He's got back the ball trying to put the reverse touch

<ICE-SIN:S2A-012#142:1:B>
Ranjid letting it go out of play Sending sends it to Eugene Eugene
trying his way trying to <unclear> word </unclear> his round into the dee

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-012#143:1:A>
And there is the horn for the full-time whistle

<ICE-SIN:S2A-012#144:1:A>
Singapore wrapping up a very impressive five one victory

<ICE-SIN:S2A-012#145:1:A>
Goals by Gavin Dan Royan Ranjid Singh uh two by Mohammud Noor Adam
and one by one Roslis uhm were responsible for the five goals

<ICE-SIN:S2A-012#146:1:A>
Indonesia's consolation coming from Randy Lai

<ICE-SIN:S2A-012#147:1:A>
Both these teams obviously had to face the group favourite
Malaysia but on the surface of it it looks as though Singapore have
guaranteed themselves at least a silver with this five one win

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-012#148:1:B>
Yes exactly Bertrand and uh </I>


<I>
