<I>

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-073#1:1:A>
I mean knew I would never be able to develop professionally in
that place for various reasons you know

<ICE-SIN:S1A-073#2:1:A>
It may be defamatory to name them

<ICE-SIN:S1A-073#3:1:A>
So I went and applied and I got a job with David Chong and company
uh David Chong <unclear> word </unclear> and partners who were interested in
my I P practice and there I continued with whatever I P work I had

<ICE-SIN:S1A-073#4:1:A>
And uhm I I did uh one or two interesting cases like this copyright
infringement case various aspects of which have been reported in the papers
and oh by the way I had some of my raids and all that reported in the papers
you know

<ICE-SIN:S1A-073#5:1:A>
I'll show you the newspaper clippings

<ICE-SIN:S1A-073#6:1:A>
And then and then I so so I got involved in registration copyright
you know some documentation and all that and when I applied to this firm I
came in hoping to develop my I P practice

<ICE-SIN:S1A-073#7:1:A>
So basically that was how it went

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-073#8:1:B>
Right so uhm you went from this small firm to David Chong where
you also did I P work and

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-073#9:1:A>
Yah yah

<ICE-SIN:S1A-073#10:1:A>
But now we're here and we both of us have to try and develop the I
P practice with our practice head coordinator

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-073#11:1:B>
Yes certainly we should try

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-073#12:1:A>
We shall do our best

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-073#13:1:B>
Yes

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-073#14:1:A>
And yourself Vasantha

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-073#15:1:B>
What would you like to know

<ICE-SIN:S1A-073#16:1:B>
My years at Smith Kline

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-073#17:1:A>
Ah

<ICE-SIN:S1A-073#18:1:A>
Ya

<ICE-SIN:S1A-073#19:1:A>
That will be interesting

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-073#20:1:B>
Okay

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-073#21:1:A>
Aye okay I want to ask you

<ICE-SIN:S1A-073#22:1:A>
Has uh you you did a lot of marketing but has that uhm deaden your
sort of diagnostic abilities if you can call it as a pharmacy

<ICE-SIN:S1A-073#23:1:A>
Because you know it's different being practising pharmacy as it is
and actually marketing

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-073#24:1:B>
Certainly what it is is that initially you get trained for a
profession but uhm if you don't work within that profession then you can lose
touch

<ICE-SIN:S1A-073#25:1:B>
You don't lose the training

<ICE-SIN:S1A-073#26:1:B>
What happens is that you may lose some confidence and you may lose
touch with the state of the art of the practice but uh it will not take very
much to go back into it

<ICE-SIN:S1A-073#27:1:B>
I mean you must bear in mind that pharmacy practice is very diverse

<ICE-SIN:S1A-073#28:1:B>
You got pharmacist who are actually in pharmacy practice in
manufacturing in hospitals in retail and uhm within the pharmaceutical
industry

<ICE-SIN:S1A-073#29:1:B>
Those within that pharmaceutical industry tend to be far more
business oriented

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-073#30:1:A>
And marketing

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-073#31:1:B>
and uh yah business and marketing oriented

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-073#32:1:A>
Because they're basically businessmen

<ICE-SIN:S1A-073#33:1:A>
I suppose it's a more fluid degree to have than something like Law

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-073#34:1:B>
It tends to be quite fluid but uh it it yah I would suppose
and you can also you've got the scientific training you see so that does I I
feel it makes a difference because it it sharpens your mind in

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-073#35:1:A>
Analytical skills

<ICE-SIN:S1A-073#36:1:A>
Do you do you think it it it sharpens your skills more than let's
say legal training has

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-073#37:1:B>
Uh definitely because it's my my scientific training that has
helped me to develop my legal skills

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-073#38:1:A>
Because I felt that with all due respect to Arts graduates I
felt that when I was when I was still an Arts student uhm are you finding all
this very interesting

<ICE-SIN:S1A-073#39:1:A>
When I was an Arts student I dealt with abstracts you know like
like when you do a practical criticism of a article and all that and that has
helped

<ICE-SIN:S1A-073#40:1:A>
Even now let's say when I view a a a movie you can actually look
and see what the nuances are and I enjoyed doing that

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-073#41:1:B>
But you see Cecilia the yah yah

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-073#42:1:A>
But le I mean legal training is very different you know and I
think my strong Arts uhm bent affected my ability to switch

<ICE-SIN:S1A-073#43:1:A>
You know what I mean

<ICE-SIN:S1A-073#44:1:A>
Because you were in Science all along even in school and if there
is a marked difference

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-073#45:1:B>
Yah uhm although I find that the the legal skills that are
required for reasoning and analytical work are very akin to Science except
that the Science is

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-073#46:1:A>
Is more precious

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-073#47:1:B>
Far more exacting

<ICE-SIN:S1A-073#48:1:B>
So however analytical you could get with your legal skills and your
legal practice you will still never reach the stage that you would truth
scientific of truth scientific uhm work

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-073#49:1:A>
Yah you see at the end of the day an an chemistry equation is
a chemistry equation

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-073#50:1:B>
It's very that's right and it is very exact

<ICE-SIN:S1A-073#51:1:B>
It is exact down to the last atom for it to be able to function
whereas there's always some amount of leeway in in

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-073#52:1:A>
No in in legal practice it can never be exact because you're
dealing with changes circumstances and changing times

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-073#53:1:B>
Yah yah so I mean no it's not a question of good or bad it's a
question of the difference

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-073#54:1:A>
It's a question of the focus yah and it has to be

<ICE-SIN:S1A-073#55:1:A>
How much more time do we have Chris

<ICE-SIN:S1A-073#56:1:A>
Nine minutes

<ICE-SIN:S1A-073#57:1:A>
Hey we didn't do too badly yah so what what else do we need to talk
about

<ICE-SIN:S1A-073#58:1:A>
Oh you say you haven't been to Sri Lanka that would be interesting
because I as you know I've married a man who's a Singhalese and uhm he is uh
I think sec perhaps a third generation Singaporean and uhm I I I think that
Asians nowadays have this dichotomy between them

<ICE-SIN:S1A-073#59:1:A>
You know about Asian identity being which is very tied to their
ethnic and racial identity as opposed to national identity and suppose to
their influences cultural influences which we have

<ICE-SIN:S1A-073#60:1:A>
I mean we're a product of uhm colonial times where uhm the language
we speak is actually a language foreign to this region

<ICE-SIN:S1A-073#61:1:A>
Don't you think so

<ICE-SIN:S1A-073#62:1:A>
And I think so the the the the the information that we absorb
generally will al always be in the English language okay

<ICE-SIN:S1A-073#63:1:A>
And that would mean that the source of this information will also
be in a way regional from the West and that does that colour our view or does
that actually change our perception of who we are

<ICE-SIN:S1A-073#64:1:A>
I give you an example like the way we dress okay

<ICE-SIN:S1A-073#65:1:A>
Is it considered a Western outfit or has it reached the stage where
it is international

<ICE-SIN:S1A-073#66:1:A>
Because when in in Sri Lanka apparently I read that they wanted to
establish national identities so they made everybody wear sarongs

<ICE-SIN:S1A-073#67:1:A>
You know what I mean

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-073#68:1:B>
Oh how strange

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-073#69:1:A>
So so

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-073#70:1:B>
What's the link of sarong with Sri Lanka

<ICE-SIN:S1A-073#71:1:B>
Sarees

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-073#72:1:A>
Sarongs

<ICE-SIN:S1A-073#73:1:A>
You know they wear the

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-073#74:1:B>
How strange

<ICE-SIN:S1A-073#75:1:B>
But that would be more to establish an identity in Malaysia

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-073#76:1:A>
No but I suppose they they have they tie something round their
but

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-073#77:1:B>
Like like dhotis

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-073#78:1:A>
Dhotis perhaps it's called dotees

<ICE-SIN:S1A-073#79:1:A>
So so do they're saying that wearing pants and wearing skirts and
blouses is a Western con

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-073#80:1:B>
Reinforces the Western influence

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-073#81:1:A>
Yah yah but does it

<ICE-SIN:S1A-073#82:1:A>
Because if you if you look at it if you look at even England or or
Europe and all that not everybody dress in jeans and shirts

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-073#83:1:B>
Well I think you have a good point there

<ICE-SIN:S1A-073#84:1:B>
You see the question about all this has got to do with whether
which stage the development of the country is at and to what degree the
government and the people and the influences of that country choose to view
culture and and uhm harmony and identity as a priority

<ICE-SIN:S1A-073#85:1:B>
I think in this current economic climate uh a lot of governments
make the conscious decision that economic factors especially in these times
of recession are far more important

<ICE-SIN:S1A-073#86:1:B>
When there's not enough accordance given to cultural aspects then
what tends to happen is that well people muddle along

<ICE-SIN:S1A-073#87:1:B>
They find their own way and the economic policies override

<ICE-SIN:S1A-073#88:1:B>
And when the economic policies override your Western influences
come in because you got your your your your yah

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-073#89:1:A>
Your media

<ICE-SIN:S1A-073#90:1:A>
Your investments

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-073#91:1:B>
You got your the countries from which you're gonna be able to
uh get the trade and give you know import export

<ICE-SIN:S1A-073#92:1:B>
So very interestingly now that the Western world has opened up so
much to the East you'll find that equally be you know they've they've come to
the East for economic purposes

<ICE-SIN:S1A-073#93:1:B>
You look at how England the United States Australia everybody is
looking at wow the China market the Vietnam market the Cambodia market you
know and the Indian market

<ICE-SIN:S1A-073#94:1:B>
Look suddenly Singapore who started going off and looking at all
these wonderful potential things they could milk from there

<ICE-SIN:S1A-073#95:1:B>
But Singapore is different

<ICE-SIN:S1A-073#96:1:B>
Singapore is still in Asia

<ICE-SIN:S1A-073#97:1:B>
But when it comes to when the other countries start uhm looking
towards Asia then uhm the economic factors bring in the cultural factors as
well and then people start to see

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-073#98:1:A>
Do you think it's it's it's so it's could it be economically
driven

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-073#99:1:B>
It's not I'm not saying I mean it's seem to be economically
driven uh whether the governments give emphasis to cultural things

<ICE-SIN:S1A-073#100:1:B>
You see once you reached a certain level of of uh

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-073#101:1:A>
Affluence

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-073#102:1:B>
Affluence then you start to look at things like my identity
self-actualization

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-073#103:1:A>
Sort of the finer things in life

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-073#104:1:B>
Correct whereas

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-073#105:1:A>
Because it's gone beyond basic survival

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-073#106:1:B>
Yes whereas if you go to places like India okay every once in
a while you have this little thing where a cultural thing will arise and
people will say and anyway the the cultural influences are still very strong
people still have an identity because ninety-five per cent of the population
is a certain race you know

<ICE-SIN:S1A-073#107:1:B>
But the thing is like in India for example where there's been so
much Western influence and the government had said that there has been but at
the same time the government is also so much more interested in the economics
of it in developing and you have to because how do you reach a stage where
you can say that oh my G D P is this much my per capita income is so much
except by improving economically

<ICE-SIN:S1A-073#108:1:B>
As you know so it's a question of the priority that the country
gives to it

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-073#109:1:A>
That that is one way of looking at it

<ICE-SIN:S1A-073#110:1:A>
But if you look at it from a historical point of view

<ICE-SIN:S1A-073#111:1:A>
Let's say you it it it who in this century all right let's say the
last two centuries which are the strong economic powers

<ICE-SIN:S1A-073#112:1:A>
The Westerns

<ICE-SIN:S1A-073#113:1:A>
You know during the colonial times it was Europe

<ICE-SIN:S1A-073#114:1:A>
It was England you know the great British empire and then in the
later part of this century aft especially after World War Two it was America

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-073#115:1:B>
Yah

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-073#116:1:A>
Right so where where where economic strength lies political
strength lies with it exert a lot of cultural influence as well

<ICE-SIN:S1A-073#117:1:A>
You know what I mean

<ICE-SIN:S1A-073#118:1:A>
Like for instance uhm take five hundred years ago they talk about
Indianisation of this region

<ICE-SIN:S1A-073#119:1:A>
Why

<ICE-SIN:S1A-073#120:1:A>
Because India was so powerful that that there was a lot of trade
done in this region through India and India had a way of uh influencing the
the religion and the culture so

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-073#121:1:B>
So it is the economic factors which are the driving force if
if

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-073#122:1:A>
Because comes comes economic power then political power

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-073#123:1:B>
I agree with you

<ICE-SIN:S1A-073#124:1:B>
I mean I I think essentially that's that's we've agreed on that
because it's not that uh the government decides that the cultural if the
cultural aspects are going in the opposite direction to the economic aspects

<ICE-SIN:S1A-073#125:1:B>
I think the economic aspects will overtake yah

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-073#126:1:A>
And then now we have and then and then of course there was
China

<ICE-SIN:S1A-073#127:1:A>
So if you look at let's say a country like Thailand and Indonesia
I mean they're actually quite diverse but at at the same time if you look at
the way their script is done the way their dances are and also like their
religion and all that it's very much influenced by the philosophies of India

<ICE-SIN:S1A-073#128:1:A>
Then again you to the other extreme

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-073#129:1:B>
Well our our pinico is based on the Indian pinico <X>

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-073#X130:1:A>
Yah but that is I'm talking about over the centuries okay
Now I think India's influence because right now India is not as influential
as when she was lets say two three hundred years ago

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-073#X131:1:B>
Yes yes

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-073#X132:1:A>
Before the British came and milked it

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-073#X133:1:B>
That's right

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-073#X134:1:A>
You know uhm it has its influence is less strong in this
region Then take China also during China's uh during the times when they were
very powerful during the Ming Dynasty during the the beginning of the Ching
Dynasty The influence they had over Japan over Korea you know what I mean
there's there's there's a general cultural slant that that you know draws its
influences from one very strong economic power </X> </I>
