<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-014#173:3:C>
With the fight for the first and second places now lost
Tanjong Pagar have their sights firmly set on the number three spot

<ICE-SIN:S2A-014#174:3:C>
A win here at the Queenstown stadium for the Jags will see them
strengthened and uh their quest will be answered if they can maintain that
third spot because they have Gombak Jurong and as well as Geylang chasing
them

<ICE-SIN:S2A-014#175:3:C>
Their opposition tonight will be Woolands Wellington a rather
erratic team

<ICE-SIN:S2A-014#176:3:C>
Before we bring you tonight's game this weekend's game let's take
a look at two matches from last night

<ICE-SIN:S2A-014#177:3:C>
Both games ended up as one all draws

<ICE-SIN:S2A-014#178:3:C>
At the uh Bishan Stadium it is Home United against Geylang United
and over at the Toa Payoh Stadium it's Balestier Central against Sembawang
Rangers <&>  Footage)

<ICE-SIN:S2A-014#179:3:C>
<unclear> word </unclear> are on top with forty-one points

<ICE-SIN:S2A-014#180:3:C>
Once again in case you didn't hear that on the table Home are on
top with forty-one points but that lead has been narrowed to just a single
point after drawing one all with Geylang United last night

<ICE-SIN:S2A-014#181:3:C>
That's good news for the Warriors who are on forty

<ICE-SIN:S2A-014#182:3:C>
The Jags are in third place on twenty-seven but once again there
is a real battle for that position with the likes of Gombak Geylang and
Jurong is the chase <X>

<ICE-SIN:S2A-014#X183:3:C>
In seventh place it's Balestier Central on nineteen and two
points back from that it's Sembawang with seventeen

<ICE-SIN:S2A-014#X184:3:C>
Tampines Woodlands Clementi and Marine Castle make the bottom
four

<ICE-SIN:S2A-014#X185:3:C>
The Dolphins can rise to tenth place if they beat thestags at
Hougang Stadium tonight

<ICE-SIN:S2A-014#X186:3:C>
The last time thetwo teams played over at the Woodlands Stadium
the Rams lost one goal to two against the Jags so what sort of a result can
we expect tonight

<ICE-SIN:S2A-014#X187:3:C>
Let's find out more from our match preview <&>  Footage </&> Well it's
not a big crowd here at the Queenstown Stadium so let's uh cross over to our
rather lonely two commentators John Faulkner and Vincent Subramanium

<ICE-SIN:S2A-014#X188:3:C>
Take it away guys </X> </I>
