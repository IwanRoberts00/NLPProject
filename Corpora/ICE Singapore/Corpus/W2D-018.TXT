<h> Starting and Caring for your Stamp Collection </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2D-018#3:1>
Starting a stamp collection is like building up your own miniature art
gallery and encyclopedia.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-018#4:1>
Because that's what stamps are - little pieces of art, each with a
story.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-018#5:1>
Through stamps you can find out the history and geography of a
country, understand its culture and ideals, marvel at its achievements,
admire its scenery, architecture or handicraft, appreciate its flora and
fauna.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-018#6:1>
You can also enjoy a stamp for its own sake, studying its beautiful
design details, printing intricacies and colours.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-018#7:1>
Stamps are so fascinating it is little wonder that even after so many
years, stamp collecting remains the most popular hobby in the world today.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-018#8:1>
<h> STARTING </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2D-018#9:1>
Stamp collecting need not be an expensive hobby.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-018#10:1>
There are a few ways to get you started.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-018#11:1>
a) Save whatever stamps come on mail you, your family or friends
receive.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-018#12:1>
Cut the stamps off the envelopes making sure not to cut too closely
as otherwise the stamp may be damaged.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-018#13:1>
Then place them face up in warm water till they are well soaked and
can come off the backing paper easily.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-018#14:1>
Next wash off any residue traces of gum from the back and put the
stamps between the pages of a thick book such as a telephone directory till
they are dry and nicely pressed and you have just started your own
collection!

<ICE-SIN:W2D-018#15:1>
b) Buy a pack of used stamps from a stamp dealer or bookshop.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-018#16:1>
The pack may contain stamps from all over the world or from just one
country.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-018#17:1>
The stamps in the pack may also be on a specific theme eg ships and
boats, aircraft, birds, etc.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-018#18:1>
c) Buy stamps currently available from the post office.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-018#19:1>
For a wider selection of stamps, you can go to any of the 6
philatelic outlets.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-018#20:1>
Or you can start a Standing Order Deposit Account ( SODA) and be
assured of receiving your stamps for every new issue.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-018#21:1>
More details of the services available for collectors are given on
page 28.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-018#22:1>
d) Exchange stamps with fellow collectors.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-018#23:1>
Joining stamp clubs is a good way to help you meet up with other
collectors and learn more about the hobby.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-018#24:1>
If you know about a stamp exhibition, you should visit it to see how
others write up their collections.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-018#25:1>
<h> COLLECTING AND COLLATING </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2D-018#26:1>
As you progress in your understanding of stamp collecting, you may
want to organise or specialise according to subject or theme.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-018#27:1>
You can choose themes which interest you such as transportation,
birds, flowers, sport, architecture.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-018#28:1>
You can also collect according to country, e.g. all the stamps of
Singapore, or according to a period of time in the postal or political
history of a country.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-018#29:1>
Whatever your interest, your stamps will give you hours of pleasure
as you spend time studying them.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-018#30:1>
<h> The COLLECTOR'S KIT </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2D-018#31:1>
Stamps are like antiques-their value will diminish if not properly
cared for.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-018#32:1>
To preserve the value of your stamps, you will need to keep them in
good condition.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-018#33:1>
There is a wide range of accessories in the market to help protect
your stamps from damage or deterioration.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-018#34:1>
Some basic accessories are listed here.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-018#35:1>
Stamp albums can help you to organise your collection.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-018#36:1>
The album pages may be printed with illustrations of the stamps of a
particular country or may be plain with only the country name or the name of
a theme ( such as birds, transportation, etc.) printed on them.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-018#37:1>
The use of gummed paper hinges to mount stamps to album pages-are
less popular these days as hinges disturb the gum of unused stamps.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-018#38:1>
Instead, the use of transparent strips ( commonly called Hawid
strips) for mounting stamps to album pages have gained popularity.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-018#39:1>
For collectors of first day covers, first day cover albums with
transparent polythene pockets are useful.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-018#40:1>
They help keep the covers from soiling through frequent handling.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-018#41:1>
Tweezers allow you to handle stamps without dirtying or damaging
them.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-018#42:1>
Choose those made of good quality stainless steel with flat rounded
ends as those with sharp ends may damage the stamps.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-018#43:1>
The tweezers you should buy are stamp tweezers which have flat ends
and not cosmetic tweezers which have ridges for better grip.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-018#44:1>
Stock books with transparent strips for holding stamps are useful for
beginners.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-018#45:1>
They keep your stamps in one place.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-018#46:1>
When you decide later on organising your collection, you can transfer
the stamps from the stock book to your stamp album.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-018#47:1>
Glassine envelopes are made of special thin paper to keep grease and
dampness from damaging stamps.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-018#48:1>
You can store your stamps in these envelopes until you put them into
your stamp albums.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-018#49:1>
These envelopes are available in packs.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-018#50:1>
Whether you collect stamps for fun or for financial returns, you will
find a stamp catalogue an important reference book.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-018#51:1>
Stamp catalogues give complete listings of all the stamps issued by
country.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-018#52:1>
Generally, catalogue listings provide details on the types of stamps
issued, from the earliest to current, the dates of issue, face values and
market values ( both mint and fine used), colours and descriptions of
designs, perforation details, printing processes and varieties, names of
designers and printers.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-018#53:1>
The information in such catalogues can help you estimate the value of
your collection, alert you to the printing varieties that exist so that you
can look out for them, let you know the number of stamps to make up a
complete set and educate you on the various details to look for in a stamp.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-018#54:1>
To help you identify your stamps, some basic accessories are required
and these are as follows:

<ICE-SIN:W2D-018#55:1>
A Colour Guide will help both beginners and specialists in
identifying the colours of early issues which tend to be printed in single
colour or at most two colours.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-018#56:1>
Modern stamps are printed in four or more colours making colour
identification difficult.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-018#57:1>
A magnifying glass is another important tool.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-018#58:1>
Available in the form of table top, hand held or pocketsize, a
magnifying glass enables you to study details of the design and printing in
the stamp.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-018#59:1>
Those interested in ascertaining the size of perforations of their
stamps will find a perforation gauge indispensable.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-018#60:1>
With the gauge, you can measure the number of complete perforations
within the length of 20mm of a stamp easily.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-018#61:1>
<h> PHILATELIC SERVICES </h>

unique history and heritage.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-018#120:1>
WATERMARK

<ICE-SIN:W2D-018#121:1>
With the exception of some issues, most Singapore postage stamps and
postal stationery are printed on unwatermarked paper.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-018#122:1>
Where watermark paper is used for specific issues, they are
indicated.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-018#123:1>
PRINTED QUANTITIES

<ICE-SIN:W2D-018#124:1>
For this Edition, the quantities indicated are only for stamp issues
from 1969 onwards: In the case of definitive issues the quantities are for
the initial order.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-018#125:1>
SIZES

<ICE-SIN:W2D-018#126:1>
All measurements for stamps are given horizontally followed by
vertically.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-018#127:1>
In the case of postal stationery, measurements are always taken of
the side with the stamp imprint, right way up.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-018#128:1>
Airletters are measured based on their folded size, ready for
posting.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-018#129:1>
For maxicards and souvenir covers, the measurements are for the
obverse with the picture right side up.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-018#130:1>
Postage labels and postage due labels are measured the same way as
stamps.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-018#131:1>
PRICES

<ICE-SIN:W2D-018#132:1>
The prices in this section are in Singapore dollars ( S1=100 cents)
and are only estimates of the current market values of the respective items
listed.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-018#133:1>
The actual selling prices offered by stamp dealers may be higher or
lower depending on supply and demand conditions.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-018#134:1>
FINE USED ( F.U)

<ICE-SIN:W2D-018#135:1>
This denotes postally used stamps which are not defective in any
manner ( eg creased, torn, discoloured, with short or missing perforations).

<ICE-SIN:W2D-018#136:1>
They are neatly cancelled with a circular postmark ( not smudged or
wrinkled).

<ICE-SIN:W2D-018#137:1>
Stamps which are not classified fine used would be worth less
depending on their condition.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-018#138:1>
CANCELLED-TO-ORDER ( CTO)

<ICE-SIN:W2D-018#139:1>
CTO stamps are more readily available and tend to have a lower value
than their fine used counterparts.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-018#140:1>
However, it is to be noted that miniature sheets are seldom found in
postally used condition and hence the prices for used miniature sheets in
this Guide are for CTO items.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-018#141:1>
Genuinely fine postally used miniature sheets fetch a premium.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-018#142:1>
UNMOUNTED MINT ( U.M)

<ICE-SIN:W2D-018#143:1>
Unmounted mint describes the condition of unused stamps which are in
pristine condition ( as opposed to fine used stamps).

<ICE-SIN:W2D-018#144:1>
Their gummed backs are also in original post office condition ( ie
no hinge marks).

<ICE-SIN:W2D-018#145:1>
In this section, prices for sets of stamps which have been hinged
before ( ie mounted), are also included for issues between 1984 and 1975 in
view of the fairly common practice amongst collectors in the earlier years to
use hinges to mount their stamps to album pages. <X>

<ICE-SIN:W2D-018#X146:1>
First Day Covers

<ICE-SIN:W2D-018#X147:1>
Covers which have stains, creases or other imperfections would
fetch lower values than those in clean, original condition. </X> </I>
