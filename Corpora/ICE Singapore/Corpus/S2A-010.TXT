<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#1:1:A>
A good tackle there by Norhalis

<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#2:1:A>
Wasting no time in dishing out the crunching tackle

<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#3:1:A>
Kannan does well

<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#4:1:A>
And a good challenge by K Kannan and a lovely ball spread out as
well to Haslim

<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#5:1:A>
Haslim is free

<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#6:1:A>
He's only got a defender in front of him and Tocky John almost got
in front of his defender and uh got to the ball before his marker

<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#7:1:A>
An offside decision

<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#8:1:A>
The Lions won't have to raise his flag up when the referee blew for
free kick to Negri Sembilan

<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#9:1:A>
Two Singapore players there trying to sandwich the Negri Sembilan
number eleven that was Yeo Swee Hock and he scored a praise of goal against
Selangor last week

<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#10:1:A>
Sure he will want to add to that tally tonight

<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#11:1:A>
He's the person on song at the moment

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#12:1:B>
And I think that is a message for the Singapore players to let
Swee Hock know that we know they're out there looking for goals and we're
gonna keep an eye on him a very close eye

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#13:1:A>
Well Negri Sembilan

<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#14:1:A>
A lot of people have called Negri Sembilan the football side the
season

<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#15:1:A>
The team of discards but I tell you something the discards have
proven to be very very successful propelling them to third place in the lead
against the free kick goal by K L discard Lim Tiong Kim

<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#16:1:A>
And the fact that Negri Sembilan has been doing so well is mainly
due to the fact that they're the almost unbeatable all season in their home
squat at the Parayi Stadium

<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#17:1:A>
Good play by Nazri

<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#18:1:A>
He misses the ball finally to Malek Kawak and to Haslim

<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#19:1:A>
Good touches by Haslim

<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#20:1:A>
A good cross in

<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#21:1:A>
A chance for Haslim and for Singapore

<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#22:1:A>
There was deflection with the state of uh Saree Said and then
Singapore has a corner

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#23:1:B>
That was very good play by Singapore

<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#24:1:B>
They looked very sharp

<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#25:1:B>
The passes were well hit purposeful and a bit unlucky there

<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#26:1:B>
Haslim

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#27:1:A>
A short corner it is

<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#28:1:A>
Haslim to Kannan

<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#29:1:A>
Kannan back to Haslim getting to the byline to produce the cross
which almost materialised into a goal

<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#30:1:A>
Abdullah Bohan who has had nothing much to do so far decided to do
something with the ball playing with himself there and Papa does a beautiful
sweeping job for Singapore

<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#31:1:A>
Well read though Manso Sulaiman and that was good play by
Papanathan

<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#32:1:A>
Manager Patrick Ang has really fired up his charges up tonight

<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#33:1:A>
He's told the Singapore players a victory and nothing else to save
a hunt for a place in the Malaysia Cup Quarter Finals

<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#34:1:A>
Rafee closely policed there by Saree Said

<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#35:1:A>
The ball breaks for Norhalis

<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#36:1:A>
This pass though well read by Sha Shariff

<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#37:1:A>
The referee thinks that was uh unfairly done by Norhalis Shafik

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#38:1:B>
As long it's done in their half

<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#39:1:B>
He can't afford to give away those free kicks around our penalty
box because Negri have got two very good uhm free kick specialist Tiong Kim

<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#40:1:B>
Robert Bozic

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#41:1:A>
That's Singapore's coach and beside him our new assistant
coach Robert Lim P N Sivagy

<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#42:1:A>
He knows how important it is to secure a win tonight

<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#43:1:A>
Manto Sulaiman unmarked

<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#44:1:A>
Inside to number six Hisham Saharuddin

<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#45:1:A>
It's a goal kick for Singapore

<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#46:1:A>
D Sindrum Moorthy

<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#47:1:A>
Well many people consider this half-fits wizard to be the saviour
of Singapore football

<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#48:1:A>
If anything else he should see to the solution of finding a classic
goal poacher

<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#49:1:A>
We hope to see some goals from him when he makes his appearance in
the second half

<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#50:1:A>
At the moment Singapore are on top <unclear> word </unclear> Negri
Sembilan but they're still lacking as far as the goals are concerned

<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#51:1:A>
Very dangerous play there by Yugoslav Goggic playing in his own
half

<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#52:1:A>
Rafi with a quick crack at goal Nazri who's free

<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#53:1:A>
Trying to give a low cross for D Tocky John but it was well read by
the goalkeeper Said Rudin Adress

<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#54:1:A>
The <unclear> word </unclear> look

<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#55:1:A>
Nazri Nasir

<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#56:1:A>
And I must say that we're very fortunate indeed to get about
eighteen thousand people here tonight watching this game between Singapore
and Negri Sembilan

<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#57:1:A>
Judging from Singapore's recent run this should be considered a
bumper crowd

<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#58:1:A>
Nazri

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#59:1:B>
It is a bumper crowd

<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#60:1:B>
It is a bumper crowd

<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#61:1:B>
I think uh a lot of them came up with the expectation of seeing
Sindram and I personally hope to see him myself

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#62:1:A>
<unclear> word </unclear> Eleven minutes of play gone by

<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#63:1:A>
Still goalless between Singapore and Negri Sembilan

<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#64:1:A>
Ahmin Norhalis

<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#65:1:A>
Very dangerous ball back by Norhalis Shafik

<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#66:1:A>
Abdul Malek doing the Sundrado now pulling out of his box

<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#67:1:A>
Pama into Kannan

<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#68:1:A>
Definitely a foul

<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#69:1:A>
A punch there a hit by Mohammud Tufik the Negri Sembilan right back

<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#70:1:A>
And they're trying a zonal marking now because uh you notice the
Negri back fall

<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#71:1:A>
They're marking these and not actually employing a certain marker
on the Singapore strikers

<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#72:1:A>
Tocky John a misunderstanding with Malek Kawak

<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#73:1:A>
It breaks for Abdullah Bohan

<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#74:1:A>
It was a shot for Abdullah

<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#75:1:A>
It was way off target

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#76:1:B>
It was they were lucky to get a throw out of that one who was
a bit of misunderstanding between Tocky John and the uh with the other
striker

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#77:1:A>
Norhalis Kannan

<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#78:1:A>
Good play by Kannan

<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#79:1:A>
Oh lovely close by K

<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#80:1:A>
A chance for Singapore to take the lead now and Waby's first touch
just let him down

<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#81:1:A>
Wonderful play good skill by K Kannan

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#82:1:B>
Yes it was good

<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#83:1:B>
It was great skill by Kannan

<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#84:1:B>
You can see there twisting and turning getting in a very good cross

<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#85:1:B>
Their first touch there and let Rafee down

<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#86:1:B>
That's our problem with our strikers though mark there

<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#87:1:B>
They're a bit on the small side and with people like uh Miloslav
lurking in the background he's uh he's European and he's a lot bigger than
our players

<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#88:1:B>
They're not going to win too many in the air

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#89:1:A>
It's very bright start though for the Singapore side

<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#90:1:A>
But it's Negri Sembilan who are threatening now to go ahead

<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#91:1:A>
It breaks for Tiong Kim and so easy he just shot

<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#92:1:A>
Rafi Ali had Ali had to do it there

<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#93:1:A>
And once again a nightmare of conceding an early goal haunt

<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#94:1:A>
Singapore

<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#95:1:A>
Remember they haven't back they've been defeated by teams who have
scored the early goal against them

<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#96:1:A>
And this time is Lim Tiong Kim

<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#97:1:A>
Norhalis Shafik guilty once again

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#98:1:B>
Well the terrible miss that Norhalis

<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#99:1:B>
He was standing alone in the box you know having uh a Wednesday
night picnic and he just punished Singapore

<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#100:1:B>
Malek had no chance with that one

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#101:1:A>
Tocky John

<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#102:1:A>
A foul there

<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#103:1:A>
In fact uh manager Patrick Ang I was speaking to him earlier on
and he told that he told Norhalis and Tocky John and he has given them twenty
minutes

<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#104:1:A>
In fact to all his players he gives them twenty minutes

<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#105:1:A>
If he suspects a drop in form he'd replace them straight away

<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#106:1:A>
Halis would do well to take heed that warning

<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#107:1:A>
Kannan a lovely touch

<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#108:1:A>
A chance for Singapore to score again oh how unlucky Amin Nasir
and that's Singapore's best chance so far

<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#109:1:A>
Good save though by the Negri goalkeeper Said Ruddin Adress

<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#110:1:A>
Under such circumstances he was blocked

<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#111:1:A>
His view was blocked

<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#112:1:A>
He did well to get down to that one

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#113:1:B>
He did very well

<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#114:1:B>
This is a very well worth free kick by Singapore

<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#115:1:B>
That's great play by one of our defenders

<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#116:1:B>
I think our strikers should take a leap out of uh Amin Nasir's
book and learn and hit the ball early

<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#117:1:B>
Sometimes they'll go in sometimes they don't

<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#118:1:B>
That one had a good chance in rolling in but credit to the Negri
goalie for getting down quickly

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#119:1:A>
Ahmin once again into that one first

<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#120:1:A>
Tiong Kim

<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#121:1:A>
Good ball out by Tiong Kim to Robert Bossie

<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#122:1:A>
Tiong Kim to Robert Brathe Miloslav

<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#123:1:A>
And a very good ball by Miloslav though straight to Haslim

<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#124:1:A>
Haslim to Kannan

<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#125:1:A>
Kannan did not control that one very well

<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#126:1:A>
Sixty minutes of play gone by and once again Singapore's defence
have conceded an earlier to Negri Sembilan

<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#127:1:A>
The goal scored by Lim Tiong Kim in the fourteenth minute of play
Tiong Kim once again

<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#128:1:A>
The Negri team are just threatening to get another one

<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#129:1:A>
Haslim in the slip up

<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#130:1:A>
Did well to get back though in time to cut the cross out for Manso
Sulaiman

<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#131:1:A>
Our Singapore defence Betrand has really been suspect all season
now haven't they

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#132:1:B>
Yes they have

<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#133:1:B>
They've let in I believe that their eighteen goal

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#134:1:A>
Eighteen

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#135:1:B>
Yes eighteen goals in

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#136:1:A>
Twelve the twelfth match

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#137:1:B>
And this one isn't even over yet

<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#138:1:B>
That's a very very poor record

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#139:1:A>
There's no excuse in giving Tiong Kim that much space and
time to actually to place a shot in the net

<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#140:1:A>
A corner by Robert Bozik

<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#141:1:A>
The referee it didn't escape the referee's eye

<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#142:1:A>
Then S Silverajan of Selangor saw that

<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#143:1:A>
The punch onto the abdomen of uh in fact it's the stomach of uhm
Amin Nasir Norhalis

<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#144:1:A>
He really mistimed his jump against Lim Tiong Kim to Nazri

<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#145:1:A>
He's been one of the brighter players in the Singapore team so far

<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#146:1:A>
Kannan to Tocky John

<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#147:1:A>
Backing very hard for this one

<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#148:1:A>
Some scrappy play here

<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#149:1:A>
Kannan takes a shot at goal easily blocked by Miroslavagogig who's
so cooly disposes of the ball

<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#150:1:A>
K Kannan almost getting his name to the score sheet there

<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#151:1:A>
Malek Haslim

<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#152:1:A>
That's being a little too clever

<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#153:1:A>
It should be Abdul Malek's ball and old Papanathan comes claims it

<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#154:1:A>
Now there's some player challenging by the Negri Sembilan defender

<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#155:1:A>
Our crowd certainly not uh savouring these opening minutes at the
National Stadium in seeing the Singapore defence concede another goal

<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#156:1:A>
A foul by Abdullah Bohan

<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#157:1:A>
K Kannan is down after that very heavy tackle on him by Miloslav
Boggig

<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#158:1:A>
And uh that ball has certainly depressed a few of the Singapore
boys

<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#159:1:A>
Bertrand

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#160:1:B>
You're right Mark

<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#161:1:B>
They look as though they've lost their uhm sense of purpose

<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#162:1:B>
They started out very well making crisp passes moving well and all
of a sudden they gave away a silly goal which has been the theme of their
play this season and they've lost the the uh the the urgency in their play

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#163:1:A>
You might see an early entrance of V Sindrum Moorthy

<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#164:1:A>
There's uh K Kannan is down with an injury

<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#165:1:A>
We don't know how serious it is but it's Miloslav and a free kick
for Negri Sembilan

<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#166:1:A>
Very dangerous but well cleared

<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#167:1:A>
Tiong Kim settling for the throw <unclear> word </unclear>

<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#168:1:A>
Hisham Bahrudin to Tiong Kim

<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#169:1:A>
Getting a free foot

<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#170:1:A>
In a very very dangerous position indeed

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#171:1:B>
And once again Norhalis was the culprit

<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#172:1:B>
He's not having a good start to this game

<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#173:1:B>
He's been a bit rash in a couple of his challenges

<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#174:1:B>
He's fortunate

<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#175:1:B>
This free kick is out to the left although there is danger

<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#176:1:B>
It it's not as having one around the uhm the arc at the edge of
penalty box

<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#177:1:B>
We really don't want to give one away there

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#178:1:A>
Robert Bosiz it is behind the ball

<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#179:1:A>
Take uh a free kick

<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#180:1:A>
Locked it high in the air

<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#181:1:A>


<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#182:1:A>
Abdul Malin claims it very confidently as well

<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#183:1:A>
Papanathan unchallenged to Kannan who is back in the field of play
to Pathma

<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#184:1:A>
Tocky John

<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#185:1:A>
A good kick on by Tocky John and Kannan trying to look for Tocky
John one once again

<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#186:1:A>
And that's a little rash on the part of Abdullah Bohan there

<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#187:1:A>
Came in a little bit too quickly and too unfairly

<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#188:1:A>
Robert Bozic

<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#189:1:A>
He's operating on the left tonight

<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#190:1:A>
Kannan

<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#191:1:A>
Good ball by Kannan

<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#192:1:A>
Tocky John has got some pace but can he reach with this

<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#193:1:A>
No he can't

<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#194:1:A>
About twenty-two minutes of play gone by

<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#195:1:A>
Singapore trailing by a goal to nil and this is the Negri coach
Yursaf Perell and uh Yursaf will certainly be more than happy with the start

<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#196:1:A>
That is uh charges have given him

<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#197:1:A>
Yuroslav

<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#198:1:A>
Very confident but uh very dangerous playing the game inside his
own half

<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#199:1:A>
His own defence a third of that <X>

<ICE-SIN:S2A-010#X200:1:A>
Not a very good ball played out by Hisham Abdul Gani It's a throw
in to Singapore taken by Ahmin Nasir And Brathe <unclear> word </unclear>
Nazaree just fails to keep the fall or to kill it with those touch Malek good
header there by Malek Very strong one He's running all the way back to
battling it out with Lim Tiong Kim In fact he got the better of Tiong Kim
that time Former teammates they were Lim Tiong Kim and Malek Kawak Certainly
need Malek and his uh high work way to influence and spur the boys on
Abdullah Bohan he's clearing that ball And after a very promising start the
game is uh somewhat has somewhat settled down And it's become a little bit
scrappy at the moment with uh no one team dominating the proceedings Robert
Bozic with a corner for Negri Sembilan </X> </I>
