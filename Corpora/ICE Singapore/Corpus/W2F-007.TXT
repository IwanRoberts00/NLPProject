<h> OBJECTS OF DESIRE </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2F-007#2:1>
Desmond Sim

<ICE-SIN:W2F-007#3:1>
Pen \'pen\ n: An implement for writing or drawing with ink or a
similar fluid.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-007#4:1>
Ah My father's pen.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-007#5:1>
Tortoise-shell, gold trimmed.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-007#6:1>
Very expensive now I should think.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-007#7:1>
He loved that pen.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-007#8:1>
Made love to it more often than to Mother.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-007#9:1>
I should know.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-007#10:1>
I always knew when the bed creaked upstairs.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-007#11:1>
My father was obsessively infatuated with his " ultimate writer's
instrument".

<ICE-SIN:W2F-007#12:1>
How often I have seen his fine long fingers wrapped lovingly around
that thick fecund form spilling the seeds of stories that never grew.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-007#13:1>
My father the failed writer.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-007#14:1>
My father, the story-teller.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-007#15:1>
Told me once upon a time how he encountered a beautiful vision at a
dance.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-007#16:1>
How he and Mother fell in love in a welling sweep of star-dust
passion.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-007#17:1>
A perfect romance.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-007#18:1>
Happy ever after.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-007#19:1>
My father, who cringed in his urine-stained pajama pants bleary eyed
and whimpering.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-007#20:1>
The storyteller, icing the wafer crust of his life with lashing curls
of fantasy running uncontrolled from his tortoise-shell pen.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-007#21:1>
The pen with which I now write.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-007#22:1>
With its curious and endless brown-red ink trails of words.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-007#23:1>
The pen who is my only friend.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-007#24:1>
Dictionary \'dik-sh-, ner-e\ n: A reference book containing words
usually alphabetically arranged along with information about their forms,
pronunciations, functions, etymologies, meanings and syntactical and
idiomatic uses.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-007#25:1>
Whatever all that means.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-007#26:1>
I suppose I could find out if I really wanted to but it's no point.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-007#27:1>
You'd just get more jargon which you have to look up - and so on and
so on and so on...

<ICE-SIN:W2F-007#28:1>
Before you know it, it's time to die.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-007#29:1>
I just look up words that I already know to see how words can lie.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-007#30:1>
Like, take the word 'dictionary'.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-007#31:1>
They can say all they want about ety-mologies and idioms and all that
stuff...

<ICE-SIN:W2F-007#32:1>
they never said it was my first real book.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-007#33:1>
Mother was a librarian.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-007#34:1>
Not too long after I learned to read, she slapped this thick heavy
book of words in front of me.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-007#35:1>
" It's all in there," she said and she left me alone with it.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-007#36:1>
I decided to consult my first friend ( Mother never allowed me out
into the playground.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-007#37:1>
She was afraid I would collect all sorts germs from the grubby kids
there).

<ICE-SIN:W2F-007#38:1>
I looked up 'love'.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-007#39:1>
It said " ...strong affection for another arising out of kin-ship or
personal ties".

<ICE-SIN:W2F-007#40:1>
To me, that said nothing.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-007#41:1>
I turned to 'hate': " Intense hostility and aversion usually deriving
from fear, anger or sense of injury..." That said everything but at the same
time close to nothing too.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-007#42:1>
Neither explained how I felt towards Mother.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-007#43:1>
But it is funny how I slowly grew to like my new, precise but
ambiguous friend.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-007#44:1>
There was something mysterious in the way everything was explained.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-007#45:1>
How the words wavered close to reality and then sometimes shimmered,
fading off into the sea of meaning and unmeaning.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-007#46:1>
I was fascinated - and hopelessly lost.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-007#47:1>
Somewhere hovering in those pages was that bright pinpoint of true
meaning that eluded me like a beckoning ghost.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-007#48:1>
Cupboard \k b- rd\ n: A closet with shelves where dishes, utensils
or food is kept.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-007#49:1>
But not Mother's antique cupboard.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-007#50:1>
It wasn't some small dainty display cupboard for Wedge-wood and
silver.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-007#51:1>
It was a large, solid Chinese rose-wood affair.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-007#52:1>
The top was arched with a pair of dragons surmounting a fiery pair of
phoenixes.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-007#53:1>
It's sturdy legs were claws clutching at the floor and it was so
ornately carved all over that I often sneezed from the decades of dust
trapped in the grooves.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-007#54:1>
There was always dust around that thing.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-007#55:1>
Mother was fanatic about dust but there wasn't a thing she could do
about the cupboard.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-007#56:1>
The fact that she actually kept the cupboard despite the dust
attested to her great passion for antiques.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-007#57:1>
She loved an-tiques more than she hated dust.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-007#58:1>
But Mother was not a passionate woman.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-007#59:1>
Her main passions were limited to one love and one hate.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-007#60:1>
All else was duty.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-007#61:1>
The only moment of animated passion that I can vividly remember as a
child ( that was directed at me) was when she caught me hiding in the empty
bottom shelf of the cupboard.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-007#62:1>
" What are you DOING in there!" she yelled dragging me out.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-007#63:1>
" I could have locked you in and you would have suffocated!" she
scolded.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-007#64:1>
But she was actually more interested in checking the shelves for
cracks or other forms of damage.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-007#65:1>
She didn't pay any attention to my explanations about finding out if
we all could hide in the cupboard if robbers broke into the house.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-007#66:1>
She probably knew I was lying.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-007#67:1>
Anyone could tell that only a child could crawl into the cupboard.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-007#68:1>
Large as it was, the only adult who could get in would either be a
contortionist or one who was chopped up.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-007#69:1>
Speaking of chops, I'm starving.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-007#70:1>
The house has been empty for ages.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-007#71:1>
I like it better empty.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-007#72:1>
I like to sit here quietly and watch the cupboard, read my dictionary
and write with Father's pen.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-007#73:1>
I enjoy sneaking his pen out of the cupboard when he is not around.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-007#74:1>
He probably won't be back.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-007#75:1>
Maybe never - I hope.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-007#76:1>
He once suspected me of using his pen when he saw my essays written
with the red-brown ink.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-007#77:1>
There was such a look on his face.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-007#78:1>
Like rage and jealousy.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-007#79:1>
It was lucky I had the presence of mind to have filled my own
fountain pen with the same ink that he used.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-007#80:1>
But Father still looked at me with his bleary killer's eyes filled
with suspicion.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-007#81:1>
I always believed that there was something dark about Father's
character.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-007#82:1>
Something hidden and poisonously violent.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-007#83:1>
How else could he have attracted so strong a woman as Mother?

<ICE-SIN:W2F-007#84:1>
And Mother, despite her massive physical strength, there was
something weak and clingy about her.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-007#85:1>
Like she needed people to need her strength.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-007#86:1>
At any cost, they had to need her.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-007#87:1>
She would rather die than be redundant.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-007#88:1>
I suspect that was why she became a librarian.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-007#89:1>
People who approached a librarian needed help.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-007#90:1>
People like Father before he fell in love with his pen.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-007#91:1>
I take out the dented saucepan and put it on the stove.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-007#92:1>
It's meat today - don't know what kind.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-007#93:1>
All I know is that it doesn't look like chicken.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-007#94:1>
I think I've got some bread and cheese.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-007#95:1>
I'd better clean things up today.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-007#96:1>
Mrs Chang from next door may start talking.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-007#97:1>
She kept insisting that the house smelled.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-007#98:1>
I told her it was the dishes in the sink but she didn't believe me.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-007#99:1>
She's too nosy for her own good.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-007#100:1>
If the cupboard wasn't so full I would've considered stuffing her
into it.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-007#101:1>
Nosey gossipy old bag.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-007#102:1>
Kept insisting that the stench came from the cupboard.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-007#103:1>
There was no way I'd have let her touch the cupboard.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-007#104:1>
Mother never let us touch it ( in her sight anyway) so what right
had a neighbour?

<ICE-SIN:W2F-007#105:1>
Thank heavens she didn't see the liquid oozing down the claw-leg on
the right side.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-007#106:1>
Oh Mother, Mother...

<ICE-SIN:W2F-007#107:1>
I wish you had been here to tell her off.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-007#108:1>
I like the way you tell people off.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-007#109:1>
You kind of fry them into a crisp with your sarcasm.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-007#110:1>
How I loved to see you at work with people you fought with.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-007#111:1>
So cool, so merciless in your intellect.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-007#112:1>
It's strange how the cupboard seems to stare at me like the way you
used to look at me when I went off into my stories.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-007#113:1>
Oh darn...

<ICE-SIN:W2F-007#114:1>
the meat's got scorched.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-007#115:1>
Mother, why didn't you teach me to cook properly?

<ICE-SIN:W2F-007#116:1>
Now that you're gone what do I eat?

<ICE-SIN:W2F-007#117:1>
I can't keep eating this meat and you know I don't like going out to
buy things.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-007#118:1>
It's not my fault I hate the outside.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-007#119:1>
Why do I keep seeing flashes of you next to the cupboard?

<ICE-SIN:W2F-007#120:1>
Mother why aren't you here?

<ICE-SIN:W2F-007#121:1>
It was the quarrel last week.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-007#122:1>
You wanted him to get a " proper, decent job".

<ICE-SIN:W2F-007#123:1>
You wanted him away from that mistress pen of his that sucked out
every-thing from him and left him with nothing.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-007#124:1>
Not even one book to his name.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-007#125:1>
He was stubborn.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-007#126:1>
Then he got abusive.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-007#127:1>
You never stood for abuse.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-007#128:1>
That is one thing I always knew about you Mother.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-007#129:1>
I knew when you folded your arms that the well known Tan Geok Lan
sarcasm was coming.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-007#130:1>
I never knew Father was impotent.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-007#131:1>
I never knew that you, Mother, with all your " proper" this and "
proper" that had lovers outside.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-007#132:1>
Then what were those creaks I heard?

<ICE-SIN:W2F-007#133:1>
Attempts at sex?

<ICE-SIN:W2F-007#134:1>
No wonder they stopped.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-007#135:1>
But you should not have gone on Mother...

<ICE-SIN:W2F-007#136:1>
You should not have said that the pen had more ink than he had
masculinity.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-007#137:1>
And Mother, you did not only hurt him when you said that I was
probably fathered by a pen.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-007#138:1>
I think he and I always knew that something was missing in that
father-and-son thing between us.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-007#139:1>
But that insult was something that helped me understand his need to
escape from you.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-007#140:1>
I wanted to warn you that he had grabbed the saucepan but it was too
late.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-007#141:1>
His mistake was that he thought he could floor you with one blow.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-007#142:1>
He never stood a chance once you grabbed a hold on the saucepan.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-007#143:1>
I was a coward Mother.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-007#144:1>
I stayed in the bedroom while you bustled around.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-007#145:1>
I did not even have the courage to ask you to stay or to ask if I
could go along with you and Uncle William.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-007#146:1>
I am still a coward Mother.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-007#147:1>
I should have called the police ( I've only read about situations
like these in books and watched it on TV), but I know if I do they will just
force me to go outside and testify.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-007#148:1>
And the newspapers will come and the reporters...

<ICE-SIN:W2F-007#149:1>
I hate you Mother.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-007#150:1>
Why didn't you take me?

<ICE-SIN:W2F-007#151:1>
There is hardly any meat left in the fridge.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-007#152:1>
I'll have to un-lock the cupboard again soon but it's beginning to
smell so bad...

<ICE-SIN:W2F-007#153:1>
There's someone at the door.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-007#154:1>
Might be the damned busybody Mrs Chang again.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-007#155:1>
Maybe she's called the police.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-007#156:1>
The door handle turns.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-007#157:1>
I see the saucepan glint-ing dully from the stove.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-007#158:1>
If only I can make a silent lunge at it.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-007#159:1>
I know how to use it.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-007#160:1>
You showed me Mother - when you opened Father's head with it.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-007#161:1>
If only I can get to it before...

<ICE-SIN:W2F-007#162:1>
" What the hell is happening Matthew?" Mother demanded, the pearls
around her cheongsam collar gleaming softly; seeming to reflect the heat of
her agitation, " We go out for one evening and the house is a war zone...

<ICE-SIN:W2F-007#163:1>
Why is the dog locked up in the cupboard - look, he's peed all over
the books in there.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-007#164:1>
And what's that horrid smell?

<ICE-SIN:W2F-007#165:1>
Was it ham-burger you burnt in the saucepan?"

<ICE-SIN:W2F-007#166:1>
" I was...er writing an essay for my creative writing group Mum and
I...er needed some ambience.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-007#167:1>
Don't worry, I'll clean up.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-007#168:1>
Oh ya, Mrs Chang wants you to return her mahjong set.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-007#169:1>
And Dad...

<ICE-SIN:W2F-007#170:1>
your publisher called to say that the advances for your two new
books are on the way.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-007#171:1>
By the way, sorry I broke the nib of your old pen.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-007#172:1>
I'll get it repaired tomorrow." </I>

<ICE-SIN:W2F-007#173:2>
<h> Family ties </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2F-007#174:2>
In one neighbourhood in Ang Mo Kio, the RC wanted to award a trophy
to the least quarrelling from neighbours.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-007#175:2>
At last they ended up with only one couple.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-007#176:2>
When questioned the wife answered that they never quarrelled because
right from the beginning they had agreed to divide their responsibilities for
all times to come.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-007#177:2>
She made all the important decisions and the husband looked after
the details.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-007#178:2>
The RC group was so impressed, they asked how they decided what was
important and what was detail.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-007#179:2>
'Simple!

<ICE-SIN:W2F-007#180:2>
My husband decides what schools our children go to, what doctor to
send for when anyone is ill, where we go for our holidays, what kind of car
to buy, and that sort of things.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-007#181:2>
These are matter of details. <X>

<ICE-SIN:W2F-007#X182:2>
" And what are the important issues you decide?", enquired the RC
members.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-007#X183:2>
I concern myself with Middle-East war, Kampuchea problems,
Unification of East, West Germany and the Star Wars programme. </X> </I>
