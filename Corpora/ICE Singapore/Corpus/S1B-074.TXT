<ICE-SIN:S1B-074#X1:1> 5 June 1992 </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-074#2:1:A>
It is interactive

<ICE-SIN:S1B-074#3:1:A>
Right now we have one hundred thousand pages which means that one
hundred thousand pages in our <unclear> word </unclear> system in
our <unclear> word </unclear>

<ICE-SIN:S1B-074#4:1:A>
Singapore Telecom we work with eighty three service providers

<ICE-SIN:S1B-074#5:1:A>
Service providers are the people that provide the information

<ICE-SIN:S1B-074#6:1:A>
Okay we do not provide the information

<ICE-SIN:S1B-074#7:1:A>
What we do is <unclear> word </unclear> the central system

<ICE-SIN:S1B-074#8:1:A>
The service provider provide the information and you as the/your
<unclear> word </unclear> users will retrieve the information from the main
database okay

<ICE-SIN:S1B-074#9:1:A>
So we have one hundred thousand pages okay

<ICE-SIN:S1B-074#10:1:A>
These are some of the services that we have

<ICE-SIN:S1B-074#11:1:A>
Okay we have adequate education packages infotainment as in
informat information and entertainment business banking and finally uh
concept <unclear> word </unclear> services

<ICE-SIN:S1B-074#12:1:A>
These are some of the things that are incorporated into

<ICE-SIN:S1B-074#13:1:A>
Yes you can see excuse me so what you have here is this the user

<ICE-SIN:S1B-074#14:1:A>
Now there are two ways the user could communicate with the main
computer

<ICE-SIN:S1B-074#15:1:A>
It's either by Uachat <unclear> word </unclear> or through the PSTN

<ICE-SIN:S1B-074#16:1:A>
That's the Public Service Telephone Network

<ICE-SIN:S1B-074#17:1:A>
Now if by any chance the reception is not good okay the machine
will automatically tape <unclear> word </unclear> into the PSTN which means
that you'll be communicating with us through the Public Service Telephone
Network

<ICE-SIN:S1B-074#18:1:A>
The development through the Public Service Telephone Network may
not be as quick as its Give you an example

<ICE-SIN:S1B-074#19:1:A>
Let me give you an example

<ICE-SIN:S1B-074#20:1:A>
This is the main page

<ICE-SIN:S1B-074#21:1:A>
This is what are the services that are available

<ICE-SIN:S1B-074#22:1:A>
What we are is information

<ICE-SIN:S1B-074#23:1:A>
Now the information you may obtain may be eased uh you may obtain
it through some other means

<ICE-SIN:S1B-074#24:1:A>
But the fact is this is convenient unless <unclear> word </unclear>
you have one hundred <unclear> word </unclear> pages of information

<ICE-SIN:S1B-074#25:1:A>
For you you could use what uh are you in at secondary school

<ICE-SIN:S1B-074#26:1:A>
You're in Ngee Ann Polytechnic

<ICE-SIN:S1B-074#27:1:A>
There're some comprehensive Ngee Ann uh packages uh polytechnic
stuff here I mean for polytechnic

<ICE-SIN:S1B-074#28:1:A>
I mean but it may not uh but it's designed in such a way it's
comprehensive primary school secondary school right up to tertiary okay

<ICE-SIN:S1B-074#29:1:A>
Business let's say for business you would have business and finance

<ICE-SIN:S1B-074#30:1:A>
You have banking services government travel

<ICE-SIN:S1B-074#31:1:A>
Now give you an example

<ICE-SIN:S1B-074#32:1:A>
For travel you may obtain these information from travel agencies
but the fact is this you may have to go from one travel agency to another to
retrieve information

<ICE-SIN:S1B-074#33:1:A>
But with this you have it all in here

<ICE-SIN:S1B-074#34:1:A>
Okay it's updated

<ICE-SIN:S1B-074#35:1:A>
It expands it contracts it hear what customers want we provide

<ICE-SIN:S1B-074#36:1:A>
There'll be service providers to work with you

<ICE-SIN:S1B-074#37:1:A>
I mean to work with with us

<ICE-SIN:S1B-074#38:1:A>
Now the information what you have is you you when you come in you
have an idea of when you go to the travel agency you have an idea of what
you're looking for

<ICE-SIN:S1B-074#39:1:A>
It saves time

<ICE-SIN:S1B-074#40:1:A>
Have you would you like to try it out Customer

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-074#41:1:B>
Uh huh uh huh Who

<ICE-SIN:S1B-074#42:1:B>
So

<ICE-SIN:S1B-074#43:1:B>
Okay okay then won't it be <unclear> word </unclear>

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-074#44:1:A>
Yes we've grown almost Information grows exponentially

<ICE-SIN:S1B-074#45:1:A>
Why should I <unclear> word </unclear>

<ICE-SIN:S1B-074#46:1:A>
Why should <unclear> word </unclear>

<ICE-SIN:S1B-074#47:1:A>
Okay uh before I show that we have telephone subscriber's directory
okay

<ICE-SIN:S1B-074#48:1:A>
Give you an example what this is

<ICE-SIN:S1B-074#49:1:A>
What what this is is this

<ICE-SIN:S1B-074#50:1:A>
Instead of you have an idea you may have a friend Tan so and so
living somewhere here

<ICE-SIN:S1B-074#51:1:A>
Okay you do not know where specifically you may not get his name
right but you have an idea

<ICE-SIN:S1B-074#52:1:A>
This thing will help you locate it okay

<ICE-SIN:S1B-074#53:1:A>
You don't have to go through

<ICE-SIN:S1B-074#54:1:A>
I had friends who want to locate someone and they go through one
name after another

<ICE-SIN:S1B-074#55:1:A>
Now in today's it's uh telephone calls are no longer toll-free

<ICE-SIN:S1B-074#56:1:A>
That may cost you

<ICE-SIN:S1B-074#57:1:A>
You pick up the number you call and then you call you get the wrong
number that costs you

<ICE-SIN:S1B-074#58:1:A>
But with this <unclear> word </unclear> Uhm

<ICE-SIN:S1B-074#59:1:A>

<ICE-SIN:S1B-074#284:1:A>
Lowest user group

<ICE-SIN:S1B-074#285:1:A>

</unclear> to a very specific model

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-074#286:1:C>

Uh Philips Securities is one of them If/Ain't <unclear> word
</unclear> that many closer There are many close user groups uh these are
service providers and they want to cater information to a selected <unclear>
word </unclear> Remember Singapore Telecom in Teleview we're providing
information we work together with service providers None are hardware
business with <unclear> word </unclear> information information that is
growing Right now a hundred thousand pages ten thousand customers eighty
three service providers and then this is only the tip of the iceberg that's
going We are at the forefront of information okay So the Education Education
We have what we call for primary school students a very comprehensive
supplementary program that uh supplements the cur current school curriculum
We have a SMART packed program A SMART packed program is some kind of you
know have you heard of the Kinkino assessment program Uh children do work on
assessments they are tested Okay with here what you do is you do your test on
this thing but you can only do it once your test and you are graded and you
are ranked So you roughly know where you are as opposed to as compared to the
comparing yourself with the other student(s </&> Go ahead and have a have a try
now

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-074#X291:1:C>
Um okay who are the people that uh program all these
information on education Who are these people

This information is catered to you It's integrated and that is the key thing
about Teleview Information You you can get this information at the paper but
the fact that you have to go through the paper look you may miss it But if
you want something Teleview <unclear> word </unclear> It's all in it

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-074#X315:1:C>
Even the news

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-074#X316:1:A>
News Reuters I mean the usual thing people will <unclear>
word </unclear> first come up to me and say 'Oh I do not have time' I do not
have time to do this I do not have time to watch TV I do not have time to
read papers But precisely this is what we want to help you do Save time so
that you'll still have information at your tip of your finger

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-074#X317:1:C>

<ICE-SIN:S1B-074#X324:1:A>
If we allow that everyone will pass one and then before we

</unclear> the planning engineer O: Ya

<$A>

page number Okay for example SIA seven four seven <&>  747 </&> Very easy very
user-friendly

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-074#X327:1:A>
