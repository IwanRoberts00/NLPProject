<h> INTRODUCTION </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-010#8:1>
Back alleys in Singapore are disappearing from the urban environment
because they are part of the shophouse architecture of the old, densely
settled central city area that is rapidly giving way to new office complexes
as a result of urban, renewal, initiated in the mid sixties.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-010#9:1>
This architecture grew up around a mode of economic organisation,
where the same premise typically combined both work and domestic activities,
and where business was very much a family affair ( Teo and Savage, 1985: 53).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-010#10:1>
While social and architectural aspects of shophouses hag been
analysed ( eg Kaye, 1960: 4585; Foong, 1973; Kohl, 1984: 171-86), the
backlanes of these shophouses have been ignored altogether.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-010#11:1>
Yet the backlane is not a trivial oddity, but is significant
historically and sociologically.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-010#12:1>
This essay attempts to trace the origins of the backlane development
scheme by the Singapore's municipal government as an early urban improvement
programme and the factors which led to its abandonment.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-010#13:1>
Throughout the essay, the backlane will be conceptualised as a
contested region.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-010#14:1>
The nature of this contest, however, changes with the history of the
alley.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-010#15:1>
In the evolution phase, it involved authorities wanting to drive
alleys through the backs of shophouses in the congested Central Area in order
to provide light, air and drainage, and owners wanting to retain the space
that would otherwise be given up for backlane construction.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-010#16:1>
In the subsequent colonialisation phase, the contest involves private
initiatives at encroaching what is essentially public space.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-010#17:1>
Concepts developed by Goffman ( 1959) and Suttles ( 1972) will be
used in the analysis of the process of colonisation of the alley.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-010#18:1>
<h> THE EVOLUTION OF THE BACKLANE SCHEME </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-010#19:1>
The continued development of entrepot trade in Singapore under a
laissez faire colonial municipal authority created a nation of shophouses,
tightly packed in the city core.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-010#20:1>
A brief history of this is given in the the 1947 Report of the
Housing Committee ( 1948: 5).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-010#21:1>
The shophouse is the most popular type of building in Singapore.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-010#22:1>
For the last 100 years Singapore has been a city of shophouses.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-010#23:1>
The original subdivisions made in the early days of Singapore to
accommodate residential property, ie large compound houses, were subsequently
subdivided into lots of about 16 feet wide and of depth up to 200 feet,
utilising to the maximum advantage the existing road frontages, making no
provision for rear access.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-010#24:1>
The result has been that buildings have been erected in the last 100
years on these lots covering the whole area except small openings which were
originally meant for airwells, but which in overcrowded conditions have
become mere flues for cooking and general purposes, and in some cases
completely roofed over.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-010#25:1>
That there was no rear access indicated that backlanes was not part
of the original plan of shophouses, as one might have mistakenly assumed.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-010#26:1>
Indeed, while shophouses had already become the major commercial and
dwelling form by mid 1800s, backlanes were constructed much later, with the
recommendation of one man, WJ Simpson.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-010#27:1>
By the early 1900s, the decades of rapid urbanisation and population
growth had caused the problems of congestion and sanitation to reach such
proportions that authorities had to act in a decisive manner.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-010#28:1>
In 1907, Simpson was invited by the government to study the health
and sanitary conditions in Singapore.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-010#29:1>
He ( 1908: 29) pointed out that the overcrowding of areas with houses
and, in turn, overcrowding of house with inhabitants were 'two well known
causes of high death rates, and the remedy lies in the removal of the causes
in the old localities and their prevention in the new and in these parts of
the old not yet overbuilt on.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-010#30:1>
Their prevention can be secured by stopping at once the erection of
houses without back lanes'; as one of the causes for poor sanitary conditions
was 'the absence of back lanes and open yards to allow of drainage,
scavenging and a free circulation of air' ( 1908: 28).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-010#31:1>
Consequently, he ( 1908: 30) recommended the general principle that 'houses
constituting each section of a block shall have at their rear a lane not less
than 15 feet, and not more than 20 feet wide for the purposes of scavenging
and drainage').

<ICE-SIN:W2A-010#32:1>
This was adopted by the colonial government in section 2(2) of the
Improvement Ordinance and 148 of the Municipal Ordinance ( Chapter 133,
1913).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-010#33:1>
The backlane issue received prominent attention once again, 10 years
after the Simpson Report, when a housing commission was set up to analyse the
deteriorating housing situation.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-010#34:1>
'As the buildings are in back to back rows, the only ingress and
egress is through the front.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-010#35:1>
Not only must all the house and kitchen refuse and the cleaning of
the latrines be therefore carried out through the front door, but the
drainage and sewage work has to pass throughout the length of the house to
the front.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-010#36:1>
It must be remembered that some of these houses have 200 inhabitants,
with kitchens bathrooms and latrines on every floor; that the kitchens,
latrines and bathrooms are within a few feet of one another; that the
contents of the latrines are removed in a bucket by a coolie; and that the
house drain into which all liquid matter flows is often in bad repair.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-010#37:1>
It is impossible for the coolie to resist the temptation of pouring
away some of the urine into the surface drain.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-010#38:1>
But even if he were to carry away all the solids and liquid found in
the latrine, yet, owing, to the latrine pails being cleansed at the time and
the washings poured into the surface drain, it would not do away with the
stench arising from the cleansings or prevent the surface drains from
becoming open sewers.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-010#39:1>
The nuisance created during these operations has, on occasions,
become so accentuated on sultry nights that it has awakened people from their
sleep in buildings where they were being carried out.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-010#40:1>
The smell of fecal matter and urine is very strong in Singapore.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-010#41:1>
Not only in a large number of the houses, but also in the morning in
the streets' ( 1918 Housing Commission vol I, A62, para.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-010#42:1>
8, 9).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-010#43:1>
The 1918 Housing Commission ( 1918: A48) concluded that the
construction of backlanes is 'the most important scheme of all, one that will
be most used', thus reinforcing Simpson's recommendation.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-010#44:1>
Finally, the continuity of the backlane scheme was ensured when Mr
William Bartley became Chairman of the Singapore Improvement Trust in 1931.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-010#45:1>
Under Bartley, the policy of the Trust was directed to an
intensification of the backlane programme which was considered to be the 'best
means of opening up insanitary blocks of back to back houses to light, air
and municipal services' ( SIT, 1948: 10).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-010#46:1>
Between 1910 and 1947, an estimated total of 252 backlanes were
scheduled for construction by the Municipal Government.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-010#47:1>
Table 1, compiled from two sources, gives the general location of
these backlanes.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-010#48:1>
It is apparent that backlanes are concentrated particularly in
districts 1 and 2 or the Chinatown area as well as in District 7 which
encompasses Kampong Glam and district 8 which includes Little India and the
area between Serangoon Road and Jalan Besar.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-010#49:1>
About 69 percent of the backlanes built are found in these three
areas.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-010#50:1>
The Simpson Report ( 1907) was, therefore, of significance because it
outlined a particular course of action, which when adopted, was to influence
policy decisions for the subsequent 30 years.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-010#51:1>
The backlane solution, an onsite strategy for dealing with urban
problems, was to take precedence over alternative solutions, such as public
housing.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-010#52:1>
Public housing provision, for example, was raised as a means of
easing Central Area congestion in by the 1918 Housing Commission.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-010#53:1>
President: Supposing that there were a City Improvement Trust in
Singapore and that it had powers for the compulsory acquisition of land for
the purpose of developing that area, would this be a suitable area for the
Improvement Trust to buy the whole block up compulsorily and then lay out
roads and then dispose of the land?

<ICE-SIN:W2A-010#54:1>
Mr B Ball(3): No.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-010#55:1>
I do not think that a public body should be put to the expense and
trouble of buying up that land and developing it(1918 Housing Commission, vol
2, para 752).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-010#56:1>
Instead of new housing provision, municipal efforts at solving the
congestion and sanitation problems of the crowded Central Area was focused on
on-site solutions.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-010#57:1>
The perceptions of officials faced with the task was that backlane
construction was the only solution. <X>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-010#61:1>
Mr Braddell: It would be impossible would it not, in respect of these
blocks of built-over land in Chinatown, these back to back houses, to improve
them in any better way than by driving backlanes through them?

<ICE-SIN:W2A-010#62:1>
The only improvement in Chinatown would be to open it up and drive
backlanes through it?

<ICE-SIN:W2A-010#63:1>
Mr B.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-010#64:1>
Ball: That is so.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-010#65:1>
( 1918 Housing Commission, vol 2, para 832).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-010#66:1>
The construction of backlanes therefore became one of the major
programmes in on-site urban upgrading and was promoted with great enthusiasm
up to the period before World War II.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-010#67:1>
References to this scheme was often couched in colourful terms.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-010#68:1>
If the Health Officers were to succeed in the fight which they were
carrying on with sickness and disease in the city of Singapore, it would not
be expected that they would do so without this provision.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-010#69:1>
The enemy with which they fought found shelter in the impenetrability
of these dark and unopened places.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-010#70:1>
The enemy could only be reached by the power of light and air, and to
dislodge him, it was necessary to drive backlanes through these haunts ( 1918
Housing Commission, vol 1: A70, para 38).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-010#71:1>
However, in spite of being the major urban policy of its day, several
problems encountered in its implementation were to eventually lead the
authorities to abandon the backlane scheme itself.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-010#72:1>
<h> PROBLEMS OF IMPLEMENTATION </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-010#73:1>
First, a problem that the authorities faced from the beginning was
the actual implementation of the scheme.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-010#74:1>
As shophouses in the Central Area were built back to back, the
opening of backlanes would involve cutting through the backs of the affected
houses, taking up to about 20 to 30 percent of the land.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-010#75:1>
Often, the size of the land had to be increased because of the need
to align the backlane.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-010#76:1>
A major implementation issue was, therefore, the level of
compensation to affected house owners for both the land and the cost of
remodelling the houses.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-010#77:1>
Hence, the 1918 Housing Commission ( 1918: vol I, A10, para 38) noted
that: 'from 1907 to 1913, very little was done to make lanes in the Congested
Area.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-010#78:1>
The reason was that the cost of compensation both under the 'back
lane' section and under the 'Reconstruction' part was not only extremely high
in itself by reason of the value of the properties affected, but was made
prohibitive by the extravagant demands of the proprietors under the sections
of the Ordinance dealing with the compensation'.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-010#79:1>
Faced with high compensatory costs, the municipal authorities
resorted to reducing the financial burdens by imposing a backlane requirement
on plans submitted for quite unrelated renovations, thereby absolving
themselves from any compensation.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-010#80:1>
This is revealed in the following testimony by Mr Seah Leang Seah, a
judge, a member of the Chinese Advisory Board and a landowner.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-010#81:1>
Mr Seah: I am not against backlanes as a whole, but the Municipal Law
is that when a man is going to put in a door or make any alteration and
applies for a permit, the Municipality are not satisfied with the plan of
that particular part of the house, but want a plan of the whole property.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-010#82:1>
Then they mark a red line across the backlane and say that if the
proprietor wants to carry out his alterations, he must give up that piece of
land to the Municipality without cost.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-010#83:1>
They do that even if he only wants to alter the front staircase.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-010#84:1>
The lawyers say 'You had better keep quiet. <X>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-010#X85:1>
Don't improve'.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-010#X86:1>
Mr Lornie: But do you get compensation, Mr Liang Seah, in these
cases?

<ICE-SIN:W2A-010#X87:1>
Mr Seah: No.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-010#X88:1>
Mr Lornie: If the land is occupied by a building you do?

<ICE-SIN:W2A-010#X89:1>
Mr Seah: If the Municipality intended to open up a backlane, and to
demolish a building for that purpose, then they pay compensation ( 1918
Commission, vol 2, para 1974, 1978, 1979).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-010#X90:1>
The effect of this approach on the landlords can be seen from the
testimony given by a landlord Mr H.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-010#X91:1>
Somapah.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-010#X92:1>
Mr Elias: The only reason why the owner refuses to sign the plan (
for renovation) is because he is afraid that a backlane will be marked.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-010#X93:1>
Mr Somapah: Yes that is the whole thing.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-010#X94:1>
Mr Elias: He will not sign a plan for the opening of a window
because if you take a plan for that, the first thing that is marked on it is
the backlane.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-010#X95:1>
Mr Somapah: Yes.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-010#X96:1>
Dr Finlayson: Then the owners are really the greatest
obstructionists to the backlane scheme!

<ICE-SIN:W2A-010#X97:1>
( 1918 Housing Commission, vol 2, para 2541-2543). </X> </I>
