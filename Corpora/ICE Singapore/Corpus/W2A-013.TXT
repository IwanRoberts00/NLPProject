This paper examines the nature of contestation in Singapore from the
historical and contemporary perspectives.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-013#5:1>
My definition of the term " political contestation" is limited to a
discussion of political party contestation in the legitimate political arena.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-013#6:1>
The analysis focuses on the experience of political parties and party
systems and the nature of contestation, and its consequences to the society
and political system.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-013#7:1>
A major thesis of this paper is that political contestation in
Singapore has been influenced crucially by a number of historical and
environmental variables.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-013#8:1>
The analysis suggests that political contestation can be understood in
the context of the Singapore government's attempt over the years towards
obtaining a broad-based and a more unitary consensus in the realm of
politics.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-013#9:1>
Moreover, the PAP government's institutionalization of its power,
since 1959, with the major political, economic and social structures in
Singapore society has created a situation where opposition parties are unable
to mount a meaningful challenge to the PAP's authority and rule.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-013#10:1>
The Making of the One-Party Dominant System Observers of Singapore's
political life have described the political party system in slightly
different ways.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-013#11:1>
Some observers call it a " dominant party system" or a " dominant
one-party system," while others have have mistakenly described it as a one
party system.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-013#12:1>
More recently, Chan Heng Chee has argued after Giovanni Sartori, that
in the era of the 1980's, the label " hegemonic party system"' is more apt in
view of developments in 1 Chan Heng Chee, " Political Parties," in Jon ST
Quah, et al., eds., Government and Politics of Singapore ( Singapore, Oxford
University Press, 1985), p.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-013#14:1>
the political arena.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-013#15:1>
Chan suggests that this is because the PAP has been the ruling party
since 1959 and the likelihood is that it will remain in power for the
foreseeable future.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-013#16:1>
Although other political parties exist in Singapore, none " possesses
a realistic prospect of attaining power in an open election since the
hegemonic party makes no provisions for defacto competition on an equal
basis".2 Our characterization of Singapore is that of a one-party dominant
system.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-013#17:1>
In such a political system, one party dominates the legislature and
much of political life.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-013#18:1>
The existence of either parties is tolerated, but they tend to be
weak and ineffectual, often becoming ( barely) visible just before
elections.3 This is a more simple and less complicated description of the
Singapore party system and allows us flexibility for greater elaboration on
the concept.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-013#19:1>
What are the factors which have caused the emergence of the one-party
dominant system in Singapore?

<ICE-SIN:W2A-013#20:1>
A major factor is the PAP's consolidation of its institutional
position in politics and almost all aspects of Singapore life since it first
came to power in 1959.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-013#21:1>
The PAP has consolidated its hold on Singapore by developing and
institutionalizing channels of influence over important structures in society
such as the civil service, statutory boards, government-owned companies,
grassroots institutions and the trade unions.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-013#22:1>
The civil bureaucracy and the government-owned companies have been
utilised by the PAP government for the implementation of its policies.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-013#23:1>
The growth of these structures over the years and their impact on
Singapore life have been described extensively elsewhere.4 What is relevant
for our analysis is the fact that these administrative elites have developed
a close symbiotic relationship with the political leadership.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-013#24:1>
In fact, the civil bureaucracy is often an important resource base
for future political leaders.5 Such a close relationship makes it difficult
for the opposition parties to draw on the resources of a large and efficient
bureaucracy to promote their political and electoral objectives.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-013#25:1>
The PAP government has also developed and institutionalized channels
of influence with the key grassroots institutions in Singaporean society.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-013#26:1>
They are the People's Association ( PA) which runs the Community
Centres ( CCs), and the related Community Centre Management 2 Ibid.

Committees ( CCMCs).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-013#35:1>
Another set of grassroots institutions are the Citizens' Consultative
Committees ( CCCs) that allow for citizens' participation in community
activities, which are also utilized as a feedback mechanism by the ruling
political elite.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-013#36:1>
Of more recent vintage are the Residents' Committees ( RCs) set up
first in October 1977 to assist the Housing and Development Board ( HDB) "
residents to settle into their new environment and hasten the process of
community bonding particularly since old community networks had been
disrupted."

<ICE-SIN:W2A-013#37:1>
6 Research on the grassroots institutions have stressed the pivotal
role of the PAP Member of Parliament ( MP).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-013#38:1>
There are many PAP leaders who believe that grassroots institutions
should be distinctly pro-party.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-013#39:1>
There is the view that the PAP branch should be the " catalytic agent
in the mobilisation of the people in the constituency and that active members
of the branch have to maintain close links with the other para-political
institutions in order to ensure that all work is in complete unison towards
the common objective of political consolidation."

<ICE-SIN:W2A-013#40:1>
7 In fact, before a general election or by-election, grassroots
leaders may be seen to be working actively with PAP activists, and a number
of these leaders may be PAP members.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-013#41:1>
8 At this point it is appropriate to review the historical record of
political party contestation in Singapore.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-013#42:1>
Such a history, of course, centres around the PAP's development and
consolidation of its power in Singapore.9 On paper, the PAP's record is
impressive.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-013#43:1>
The party was formed in 1954 and has been in power since 1959, when
it won 43 of the 51 seats in the Legislative Assembly.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-013#44:1>
In the four general elections between 1968 and 1980, the PAP won all
seats in Parliament each time with total votes cast ranging from 69 percent
to 84.43 percent.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-013#45:1>
In the Anson by-election of October 1981, however, an opposition
party member, JB Jeyaretnam of the Workers' Party ( WP), was elected into
Parliament for the first time in fifteen years.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-013#46:1>
In the December 1984 general election, the PAP won 77 of the 79
parliamentary seats and out of these, 30 PAP candidates had been returned
unopposed on nomination day.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-013#47:1>
Two opposition candidates were returned for the first time in general
elections since 1968.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-013#48:1>
They were JB Jeyaretnam-6 Chan Heng Chee, " The Local Political
System and Community Development in Singapore,", Paper presented at Seminar

9 This analysis is partially based on Lee, " Political

Anson, and Chiam See Tong, leader of the Social Democratic Party ( SDP) in
Potong Pasir.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-013#53:1>
More significantly, the PAP's share of total votes cast went down
from 75.5 percent in 1980 to 62.9 percent in the general election.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-013#54:1>
Its share of valid votes cast ( not counting the spoilt votes)
dropped from 77.7 percent to 64.8 percent.10 Recently, in the September 3,
1988 general election, the PAP won 80 out of the 81 seats in Parliament.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-013#55:1>
Its share of the valid votes cast was 63.1 percent a drop of 1.7
percentage points from the 1984 results.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-013#56:1>
11 In 1988, the PAP won 80 of the 81 parliamentary seats.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-013#57:1>
A more detailed analysis of the 1988 general election results will be
made in the latter part of this paper.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-013#58:1>
The above figures do not tell much about the qualitative aspects of
the nature of political contestation in Singapore and the PAP's accession to
power.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-013#59:1>
Internal PAP historians and others have documented the PAP's early
years as an opposition party and its links with the communists and fellow
travellers in the United Front.12 The PAP was fighting against colonialism
and the David Marshall and Lim Yew Hock governments.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-013#60:1>
In the early 1960s, the PAP was also involved in a fight for survival
as left wing elements inside and outside the party made attempts to topple
it.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-013#61:1>
In addition, during this period the PAP began to campaign and
negotiate for Singapore's merger with the proposed Malaysia.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-013#62:1>
By February 1963, the left-wing movement was effectively crippled
with the arrests of more than one hundred pro-Communist, political, trade
union and student leaders.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-013#63:1>
On September 1, 1962, Singapore residents in a referendum had also
supported the proposal for merger.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-013#64:1>
The country's removal from Malaysia in August 1965 allowed the PAP to
focus its efforts on building a new nation and to consolidate and expand its
hold on the nation state.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-013#65:1>
If we focus on the historical record of the opposition political
parties in Singapore it is clear that their role has been extremely weak for
a number of reasons.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-013#66:1>
One reason is that the PAP, as discussed earlier, has
institutionalized its relationship with key institutions in Singapore
society.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-013#67:1>
This makes it difficult for the opposition parties to draw on the
vast resources of say, the civil bureaucracy and the grassroots institutions.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-013#68:1>
The reluctance of the PAP to allow opposition parties access to the
decision-making bodies of the grassroots institutions has historical roots in
the close struggle for political power with the Barisan Socialis in the early
years of the 1960s.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-013#69:1>
In constituencies which had voted in Barisan Socialis 10 Sunday
Times, December 22, 1984; quoted in Lee Boon Hiok, " Singapore in 1984: A
Time for Reflection and a Time for Change," in Southeast Asian Affairs 1985 (
Singapore, Institute of Southeast Asian Studies, 1985), p. 302.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-013#70:1>
11 The Sunday Times, September 4, 1988.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-013#71:1>

People's Action Party, 1979).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-013#72:1>
candidates, members of grassroots institutions were chosen by the PAP
government and their activities coordinated by the Prime Minister's office (
PMO) and the PA.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-013#73:1>
13 Again when the WP candidate, JB Jeyaretnam, won in the Anson
by-election in December 1981, he was not made adviser to the grassroots
institutions in his constituency as is normally the case.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-013#74:1>
After Jeyaretnam was re-elected to Parliament in 1984, together with
Chiam See Tong, in Potong Pasir, the advisers to the grassroots institutions
in Anson and Potong Pasir were the two defeated PAP candidates.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-013#75:1>
Another reason for the weakness of the opposition parties is that
from 1965 to the middle 1970s, the PAP government applied severe legal and
political measures to combat the emergence and growth of a credible
opposition political organization.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-013#76:1>
The measures were often expressed in terms of the PAP government's
survival ideology and the need to maintain political stability in Singapore.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-013#77:1>
Both the pro-communist and the non-communist elements in the
opposition suffered from the measures.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-013#78:1>
After 1965 " the PAP government feared the threat to Singapore's
independence posted by external interests and opposition parties came under
constant suspicion of being manipulated by such interests.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-013#79:1>
Inbuilt structural disadvantages for the effective organization of
opposition politics dissuaded the educated and the professional elite"15 from
joining the opposition parties.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-013#80:1>
A final reason for the relative weakness of the opposition parties is
the PAP government's ability to deliver the economic and political goods.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-013#81:1>
The successes of the PAP in the economic realm do not need to be
itemised, but together with these economic goods there was the production of
political kinds of goods such as justice, liberty, peace and security.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-013#82:1>
No doubt many of the achievements come from the fact that the PAP had
built over the years a generally efficient and incorrupt public bureaucracy.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-013#83:1>
This administrative infrastructure has also been responsive to the
dictates of the political leadership and the needs of the population.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-013#84:1>
At this point it may be useful to highlight the track record of the
opposition parties to illustrate the above remarks. <X>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-013#X85:1>
On December 31, 1987 there were 21 registered political parties (
including the PAP) in Singapore.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-013#X86:1>
The opposition parties are the Alliance Party Singapura, the
Angkatan Islam, the Barisan Socialis, the Justice Party Singapore, the
National Party of Singapore, the National Solidarity Party, the Partai Rakyat
( Singapore State Division), the Parti Kesatuan Ra'ayat ( United 13 Lee, "
Decentralizalion for Development in Singapore," op cit, p 328.

Democratic Party), the People's Republican Party, the Persatuan
Melayu Singapura, the Pertubohan Kebangsaan Melayu Singapura, the Singapore
Chinese Party, the Singapore Democratic Party, the Singapore Indian Congress,
the Singapore United Front, the People's Front, the Workers' Party, the
United National Front, the United People's Front and the United People's
Party.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-013#X91:1>
Several observations may be made about these opposition parties.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-013#X92:1>
First, many of them are almost dormant between elections, coming
alive just before a by-election or general election.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-013#X93:1>
Even then their participation in the electoral arena is in a token
and not completely organised manner.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-013#X94:1>
Secondly, the major opposition parties have seen changes in their
electoral fortunes over the years.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-013#X95:1>
This is particularly so for the Barisan Socialis which was founded
in July 1961 as part of a left-wing breakaway group of the PAP.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-013#X96:1>
For about ten years the Barisan Socialis was regarded as the most
important party after the PAP, and in the general election of September 1963,
it won 13 seats in the Legislative Assembly and 32.9 percent of the popular
vote.17 Government action and internal party dissension in relation to a
number of issues led to the party losing all the 10 seats contested in the
1972 general election.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-013#X97:1>
The dismal performance of the Barisan Socialis in general elections
since then, under its leader Dr Lee Siew Choh, indicates that the party " is
clearly no longer an opposition force to be contended with and it is doubtful
if it can maintain a presence much longer."

<ICE-SIN:W2A-013#X98:1>
The WP has, since the eclipse of the Barisan Socialis, been the
opposition party which has received the most attention in the politics of
Singapore.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-013#X99:1>
The party was formed in 1957 by David Marshall after he left the
Labour Front government.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-013#X100:1>
In 1963, Marshall left the party after a dispute over the Malaysian
referendum issue.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-013#X101:1>
The WP was inactive until 1968 when it was the only party which ran
in the general election.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-013#X102:1>
In 1971, JB Jeyaretnam took over the party organization and brought
in new members, some of whom were professionals.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-013#X103:1>
The WP platform is essentially legalistic in nature and biased
towards the concerns of the English educated although its members come mainly
from the working class.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-013#X104:1>
In elections the WP has been a source of the protest votes against
the PAP.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-013#X105:1>
For example in the 1972 general election, the WP fielded 27
candidates and polled about 12 percent of all votes cast.

19 Ibid, p 166.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-013#X110:1>
The WP's progress in the political arena has, nevertheless, been
complicated by poor organization, low finances and the legal problems of the
leaders.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-013#X111:1>
JB Jeyaretnam was sued by the Prime Minister, Lee Kuan Yew, for
defamation.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-013#X112:1>
In 1978 the High Court found him guilty and ordered him to pay
S&dollar;120,000 damages to the Prime Minister.20 In July 1986, Jeyaretnam was
disqualified from membership of Parliament when he lost his appeal in the
High Court for false declarations of the WP's accounts.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-013#X113:1>
He was fined
&dollar;5000 and jailed for one month.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-013#X114:1>
Under the constitution of Singapore a person is disqualified from
being an MP if he has been sentenced to at least a year's jail or fined
S&dollar;2000 or more.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-013#X115:1>
The SDP, under Chiam See Tong, a lawyer, was registered in 1981 but
Chiam was politically active before that.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-013#X116:1>
In the 1976 general election Chiam ran against a senior government
minister, Lim Kim San, and won 11.1 percent of the popular vote.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-013#X117:1>
In the Potong Pasir February 1979 by-election, Chiam acquired 32.4
percent of the popular vote.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-013#X118:1>
In the 1980 general election, Chiam gained 41 percent of the valid
votes cast.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-013#X119:1>
Running under the SDP ticket in Potong Pasir, in the 1984 general
election, Chiam won by a majority of 3,454 votes.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-013#X120:1>
Chan Heng Chee has astutely pointed out that the significance of
the " Chiam phenomenon is that the Singapore electorate clearly places an
emphasis on formal attributes of education and training in their selection of
representatives.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-013#X121:1>
That Chiam was not associated with a coterie of men who lacked
credibility, or with the familiar discredited opposition may have worked in
his favour."

<ICE-SIN:W2A-013#X122:1>
22 The Run-up to the 1988 General Election Despite the fact that
the PAP in terms of electoral seats had received an overwhelming mandate from
the voters in the 1984 general election, there was concern at the drop in the
PAP's share of votes cast.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-013#X123:1>
At this election, 1.54 million who were 21 years of age and above
were eligible to vote, and for the first time the electorate was dominated (
over 60 percent) by voters who were aged 40 or below.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-013#X124:1>
In fact, the number of new voters was about 215,000 and they were
in the age group of 21-24 years.23 Lee Kuan Yew in an 80-minute press
conference within an hour of the full election results acknowledged the
receipt of a clear signal from a significant portion of the young voters for
a more open and less austere government.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-013#X125:1>
During the press conference, Lee said that he was seriously 20

thinking about changes to the one-man one-vote system.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-013#X132:1>
Asked what alternatives there were to the system, Lee said that he
was thinking of modifications to make sure the excesses were not carried too
far.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-013#X133:1>
Lee observed that if there had been another 14 percent shift in the
votes, the combined opposition would have captured 40 seats and the PAP 39.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-013#X134:1>
Lee's remarks indicated that in the future the PAP would be
introducing constitutional and electoral measures to change the nature of
political contestation in Singapore.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-013#X135:1>
It was also clear that, although the PAP government realized that
some of its controversial policies might have cost it some votes at the
election, it underestimated badly the extent of the protest vote.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-013#X136:1>
A letter to the press after the elections argued that the PAP did
not have sufficient feedback channels and that a centralized feedback
organization be established for such a purpose.24 Another view argued that
PAP leaders " have not quite got their fingers on the pulse.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-013#X137:1>
Although the signals have been sent, the PAP have not read them
accurately."25 The PAP was sufficiently concerned about the election results
to form a nine-man task force, headed by the party chairman, Ong Teng Cheong,
to analyse the results.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-013#X138:1>
In January 1985, the newly-appointed First Deputy Prime Minister,
Goh Chok Tong gave the first hint that a formal mechanism would be introduced
to allow consultation with the people on major issues which significantly
affect their lives, before any decisions are taken.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-013#X139:1>
Goh said that such a system would give the public a forum so that
they can understand major policies better.26 In April 1985, it was announced
that a Feedback Unit would be created in the Community Development Ministry
to open a fresh communication channel for the goverment to keep in touch with
the people.27 Research interviews and published reports indicate that the
public has been directing its views to the unit on a variety of matters.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-013#X140:1>
A senior Ministry of Development official said that " the presence
of the unit has helped to reinforce what we learn from other sources, which
include inputs from MPs, the grassroots bodies and letters to the press."

The town councils ( TC) concept introduced as a pilot scheme in
three sets of constituencies on September 1, 1986 was to have eventually a
more direct impact on the nature of political contestation in Singapore.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-013#X142:1>
On paper the TC concept represents an innovative reform aimed at
decentralizing the decision-making process to encourage grassroots 24 Straits

democracy.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-013#X148:1>
The plan was to tap the existing pool of political leaders and have
them help in the running of Housing and Development Board ( HDB) estates.29
In January 1987, the TC concept was linked to a proposal on Team MPs which
would represent an important change in the system of Singapore electoral
politics.30 Instead of the existing system of voting for an MP in each
constituency, voters in the three adjacent constituencies constituting a TC
would, under the proposed scheme, vote for a team of three candidates from
the various teams put up by the political parties contesting a general
election.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-013#X149:1>
The team obtaining the highest number of votes would win the
election, and its three members will become MPs and be held collectively
responsible for running their TC.31.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-013#X150:1>
Lim Boon Heng, the PAP MP for Kebun Bahru, gave two reasons for
introducing the Team MP proposal.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-013#X151:1>
One reason had to do with the underlying message " that voters must
vote wisely because they have to live with their choices."32 A second reason
was that it would help to improve the calibre of election candidates,
especially those from the political parties.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-013#X152:1>
As the elected Team MPs are responsible for running their TC,
candidates for election must demonstrate " some form of administrative
ability if they want to get elected and run the town councils."33 The
implication here was that the PAP was insisting that future MP candidates
must possess certain abilities which were beyond the minimal requirements for
running for political office in Singapore.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-013#X153:1>
In February, 1987 Goh Chok Tong announced that the government would
introduce the plan in the next general election.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-013#X154:1>
Later in the year a third reason emerged for the establishment of
the Team MPs scheme.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-013#X155:1>
This was the fact that the scheme now called the Group
Representation Constituencies ( GRC) system would ensure continued minority
representation in Parliament.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-013#X156:1>
Under the GRC system, candidates must contest in groups of three,
one of whom must be a Malay or a person from another minority group.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-013#X157:1>
The disclosure of this reason by the government, added a racial
dimension to the GRC debate, and in March 1988 there was a four-day public
hearing of a Parliamentary Select 29 For more details, see Lee, "

To further complicate the constitutional and electoral scene in
Singapore, the PAP government in early 1988 announced that it proposed to
change the Constitution to increase the President's powers.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-013#X167:1>
Under the new proposal, the President ( and a Vice President) would
be elected in a special election which would be held every six years.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-013#X168:1>
The elected President would have enhanced powers.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-013#X169:1>
He must agree before the government can spend the nation's savings.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-013#X170:1>
Furthermore his agreement is also needed when filling key positions
in the civil service and specified statutory boards.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-013#X171:1>
The PAP argued that the changes would prevent any future government
from quietly spending the nation's reserves without letting the people know.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-013#X172:1>
Furthermore, the proposal that the President must agree to the top
appointments in the civil bureaucracy and government-owned companies will
prevent any government from replacing those in the job with people more to
its liking.35 The stage was now set for the general election. </X> </I>
