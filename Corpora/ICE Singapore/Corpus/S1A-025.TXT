<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-025#229:1:B>
They wanted Chinese opera you see

<ICE-SIN:S1A-025#230:1:A>
Ha

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-025#231:1:B>
Ya

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-025#232:1:A>
Aiyoh <O> laughs </O>

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-025#233:1:B>
Because they thought opera on the hill and I think they got
Beijing Opera you know

<ICE-SIN:S1A-025#234:1:B>
They got <unclear> word </unclear>

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-025#235:1:A>
Ya ya they got <unclear> word </unclear>

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-025#236:1:B>
from I don't know

<ICE-SIN:S1A-025#237:1:B>
They've performed already is it

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-025#238:1:A>
Ya

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-025#239:1:B>
Oh I thought I wanted to go and see

<ICE-SIN:S1A-025#240:1:B>
So they asked us to go you see

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-025#241:1:A>
Uhm uhm

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-025#242:1:B>
Then because we also had our festival uh

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-025#243:1:A>
Uhm

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-025#244:1:B>
So I said we're very busy but if the timing fits uh might be
we could you see

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-025#245:1:A>
Uhm

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-025#246:1:B>
Then I asked him about pricing lah

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-025#247:1:A>
Uhm

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-025#248:1:B>
Supposing you know if it is open air uh it would be nice to
have live music right

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-025#249:1:A>
Uhm

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-025#250:1:B>
Musicians and all that playing uh

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-025#251:1:A>
Uhm

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-025#252:1:B>
So if you have live musicians uh then the cost would go up

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-025#253:1:A>
Uhm ya

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-025#254:1:B>
and if you've taped music of course it would be very cheap
nuh

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-025#255:1:A>
Not nice ya

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-025#256:1:B>
But won't be nice

<ICE-SIN:S1A-025#257:1:B>
So I thought you know taped music won't be so effective

<ICE-SIN:S1A-025#258:1:B>
Anyway I've told them the cost but they never came back to me

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-025#259:1:A>
It's probably too expensive

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-025#260:1:B>
Probably too expensive

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-025#261:1:A>
Ya I wonder how much they pay all these charge <unclear> word
</unclear>

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-025#262:1:B>
And then I I told them you know they could even have the
China people perform right

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-025#263:1:A>
Ya ya

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-025#264:1:B>
For example 'lan ma' uh

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-025#265:1:A>
The guests

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-025#266:1:B>
uh guests

<ICE-SIN:S1A-025#267:1:B>
That will be very nice isn't it

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-025#268:1:A>
Ya

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-025#269:1:B>
But I suppose they probably couldn't budget so much to pay
for it

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-025#270:1:A>
Uhm uhm

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-025#271:1:B>
So the whole thing was out lah

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-025#272:1:A>

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-025#273:1:B>
I mean they they never contacted me again

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-025#274:1:A>
Uhm uhm uhm

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-025#275:1:B>
But it's quite a thing

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-025#276:1:A>
Ya it's quite fun

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-025#277:1:B>

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-025#279:1:B>
You have the hill

<ICE-SIN:S1A-025#280:1:B>

<ICE-SIN:S1A-025#358:1:A>
That's why

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-025#359:1:B>
some of the things

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-025#360:1:A>

But it clashes with the Film Fes isn't it

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-025#379:1:A>
Ya everything clashes with Film Fes

<ICE-SIN:S1A-025#380:1:A>
Ya ya everything clashes with Film Fes lor

<ICE-SIN:S1A-025#381:1:A>
Then just before Film Fes

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-025#382:1:B>
Uhm

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-025#383:1:A>
at that European Community Film Fes

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-025#384:1:B>
Oh

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-025#385:1:A>
Ya

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-025#386:1:B>
But that was before the Film Fes so it's not so bad you see

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-025#387:1:A>
Ya ya but then it's like you know

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-025#388:1:B>
Too close

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-025#389:1:A>
Ya

<ICE-SIN:S1A-025#390:1:A>
Then you got to spend so much money

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-025#391:1:B>
uhm and so much time

<ICE-SIN:S1A-025#392:1:B>
Uhm

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-025#393:1:A>
Ya

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-025#394:1:B>
Is that Film Fes is still on uh

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-025#395:1:A>
Yep until next Sunday

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-025#396:1:B>
Oh so it really clashes uh

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-025#397:1:A>
Uhm

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-025#398:1:B>
I don't know why they don't space it out properly uh

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-025#399:1:A>
Ya don't know lah

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-025#400:1:B>
Uhm

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-025#401:1:A>
There's a lot of explanations and and all that

<ICE-SIN:S1A-025#402:1:A>
Then June got Arts Fes

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-025#403:1:B>
Ya June got Arts Fes so whoa this year full of fes

<ICE-SIN:S1A-025#404:1:B>
Tiring lah hor

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-025#405:1:A>
Ya sometimes

<ICE-SIN:S1A-025#406:1:A>
Okay lah

<ICE-SIN:S1A-025#407:1:A>
I mean it's probably the same crowd who go to film fes and arts
fes <X>

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-025#X408:1:B>
Ya the same people what A lot of yuppies also go to this

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-025#X409:1:A>
And it's amazing you know The shows uh most of the films are
I think sold out you know

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-025#X410:1:B>
Uhm uhm

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-025#X411:1:A>
Ya

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-025#X412:1:B>
But Film Fes usually like that

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-025#X413:1:A>
Ya

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-025#X414:1:B>
You find it hard to guide <&>  get </&> get tickets

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-025#X415:1:A>
Ya but then then it's like you know the rest of the year we
don't have very good stuff in the local cinemas

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-025#X416:1:B>
Uhm

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-025#X417:1:A>
Then but then when the Film Fes comes around people snap up
the tickets So that means there is a market for for this kind of more unusual
films

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-025#X418:1:B>
Not really you know I mean because there's a film fes sort
of people know that these things are on If you space it out and you put it on
the commercial market nuh

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-025#X419:1:A>
Uhm uhm

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-025#X420:1:B>
then you may miss it you know

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-025#X421:1:A>
Market you then you must publicize it market it <unclear>
word </unclear>

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-025#X422:1:B>
And then the commercial market uh for this type of film uh
it won't last long you see Couple of days uh Then by the time you get to know
about it it's off right

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-025#X423:1:A>
Ya That's why they they don't publicize their stuff properly
especially Cathay

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-025#X424:1:B>
Whereas in the Film Fes it's all concentrated

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-025#X425:1:A>
Ya and they have publicity whereas like you know a lot of
commercial cinemas they don't publicize their films So couple of good films
come to Cathay you know

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-025#X426:1:B>
Uhm

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-025#X427:1:A>
go to Picture House or whatever

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-025#X428:1:B>
and then you miss

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-025#X429:1:A>
they're not publicized at all There's no write-up about them
You know nothing about them Three days later they're gone

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-025#X430:1:B>
Uhm

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-025#X431:1:A>
So I figured it out Cathay's tac tactic is uh they bring in
the big films right

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-025#X432:1:B>
Uhm

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-025#X433:1:A>
and then in between the big films they throw in filler
movies

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-025#X434:1:B>
Uhm

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-025#X435:1:A>
and I think that sometimes the filler movies are worth
watching People would go and watch if only you promote the movies I think you
can earn even more money

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-025#X436:1:B>
But maybe they think it's too much money to spend on
advertisements Ya

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-025#X437:1:A>
Ya But it's it's such a waste you know

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-025#X438:1:B>
Ya

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-025#X439:1:A>
Such a waste </X> </I>
