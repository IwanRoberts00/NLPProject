1) Following from users' feedback to Computer Centre's " User
Satisfaction Survey" last year, Computer Centre has reorganised our IT (
Information Technology) support infrastructure to better service user needs.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-001#69:4>
2) To date, we have set up 4 multi-disciplinary support groups to
service - Engineering/Architecture & Building Science/Medicine/Dentistry Arts
& Social Sciences/Law/Business Administration Administration.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-001#70:4>
Each of these 4 multi-disciplinary user support group is staffed with
Computer Centre's expertise in application software, networking and
workstation.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-001#71:4>
3) In addition, Computer Centre has upgraded our Helpdesk into a
Problem Response Centre ( PRC) which aims to provide one-stop service to
users' computer problems.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-001#72:4>
The PRC in Computer Centre is now staffed with 3 qualified
Information Technology Officers.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-001#73:4>
There are also 3 telephone lines available for users to contact PRC,
instead of the previous 1 line for Helpdesk.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-001#74:4>
All calls received at PRC are logged into an on-line Problem
Ticketing System to facilitate Computer Centre's problem tracking and
monitoring work.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-001#75:4>
In the case of Faculties of Architecture & Building and Engineering,
they have established their own Helpdesks which work in partnership with
Computer Centre's PRC.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-001#76:4>
Further details on PRC are available from the brochure enclosed.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-001#77:4>
4) Kindly bring the contents of this circular to the attention of all
staff members in your department.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-001#78:4>
A copy of the PRC brochure has been prepared for each computer user (
based on NUSNET userIDs) in your department.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-001#79:4>
The attached name list will assist your department in the
dissemination of the brochure.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-001#80:4>
If your department requires additional copies of this brochure,
please contact Ms Afsah of Computer Centre at tel ext 2484 ( or NUSNET userID
CCEGEN2:CCE).

<ICE-SIN:W2D-001#81:4>
5) Thank you for the continued support and feedback you have given
us.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-001#82:4>
Computer Centre is constantly striving to upgrade our services to
better support our 20,000 strong user base comprising teaching, research and
administrative staff and students.

Requests for such permission should be carefully thought through and

would consider such requests.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-001#127:6>
Each request would be considered on a case-by-case basis subject to

<ICE-SIN:W2D-001#131:6>

<ICE-SIN:W2D-001#147:7>
 In response to the government's call for continued efforts to
achieve a smoke-free environment in Singapore, the University will be
introducing additional measures in its attempt to eradicate smoking on
campus.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-001#148:7>
 Among other things, the University will reach out to staff members
who are identified as smokers and advise them to attend smoking cessation
clinics which will be conducted by the University Health Service.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-001#149:7>
 This service is expected to be operational by the end of this
current academic year.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-001#150:7>
 Heads of Departments are therefore requested to assist the
University in its survey to identify staff members who are smokers.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-001#151:7>
 We would appreciate it if you would forward the names and
designation of staff members in your department whom you personally know to
be a smoker, and also indicate, if you have the information, whether they are
