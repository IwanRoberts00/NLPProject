On AM Singapore we'll be exploring the approach to this year's
speak mandarin campaign five ways to save the environment and a French
minister's view on trade and tariffs

<ICE-SIN:S1B-043#2:1:A>
Good morning I'm Elynur Nair

<ICE-SIN:S1B-043#3:1:A>
But first patriotic missiles have been deployed to Saudi Arabia from
the United States along with one thousand three hundred soldiers trained to
use them

<ICE-SIN:S1B-043#4:1:A>
This comes at a time when tension is high in the region where Iraq
continues to detain the UN team hunting for evidence of its nuclear programs

<ICE-SIN:S1B-043#5:1:A>
So far only two of the US-gulf war allies have responded to the
situation

<ICE-SIN:S1B-043#6:1:A>
The British and Israeli prime ministers have both called for the
destruction of Iraq's nuclear capabilities

<ICE-SIN:S1B-043#7:1:A>
Other allies especially the middle-easterns are keeping quiet on
this issue

<ICE-SIN:S1B-043#8:1:A>

Univerisity earlier this morning <X>

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-043#10:1:B>
But by keeping quiet can they defuse the tension it doesn't
help any does it <X>

<ICE-SIN:S1B-043#X11:1:B>
PR </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-043#12:1:B>
Well Saudi Arabia is getting ready for a major crisis by
accepting the patriot missiles at this time does this mean that uhm it is
taking sides with the US <X>

<ICE-SIN:S1B-043#X13:1:B>
PR </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-043#14:1:B>
Well if them no eastern allies don't want to take sides can
they be relied on to rally around the US once again

<ICE-SIN:S1B-043#15:1:B>
Should force be decided on by the security council <X>

<ICE-SIN:S1B-043#X16:1:B>
PR </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-043#17:1:A>
That was Dr Paul Rogers on support for the US from its allies

<ICE-SIN:S1B-043#18:1:A>
The time now is nineteen minutes past seven and next we look at
news occurring on the home front speak mandarin in mandarin

<ICE-SIN:S1B-043#19:1:A>
Well it's that time of the year again to brush up on your mandarin
that is if you're a Chinese Singaporean and haven't been speaking mandarin
for the twelve years the campaign's been on

<ICE-SIN:S1B-043#20:1:A>
If you're one of them the organisers hope that this time round
Chinese mythological figures a lighthearted approach and even some humour
will convince you to speak more mandarin and through it better appreciate
Chinese culture

<ICE-SIN:S1B-043#21:1:A>
For the theme this year is that mandarin is more than just a
language

<ICE-SIN:S1B-043#22:1:A>
This is a change from last year's slogan if you're a Chinese make a
statement in mandarin that raised quite a few eyebrows

<ICE-SIN:S1B-043#23:1:A>
With that in mind how careful have the organisers been to avoid
another issue

<ICE-SIN:S1B-043#24:1:A>
Deputy Director of publicity and promotions at the ministry of
information and the arts Henry Ng explains

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-043#25:1:C>
<unclear> word </unclear> in this year we're taking a
different approach the approach we take is a light-hearted approach it won't
be offending anybody

<ICE-SIN:S1B-043#26:1:C>
We want to appeal to people's urge to learn the Chinese culture and
Chinese heritage through the use of mandarin that means if you know mandarin
you speak mandarin you appreciate Chinese culture better

<$D> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-043#27:1:D>
Have you taken soundings from the other committees to see if
the they feel that this year's slogan is perhaps uhm as sensitive as last
year's

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-043#28:1:C>
I think uh in the committee to promote the use of mandarin we
have uh members who are English educated

<ICE-SIN:S1B-043#29:1:C>
Their views have been sought and they have given an input uh in
coming out with this slogan so I think that this year's slogan won't be as
controversial as the past year

<$D> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-043#30:1:D>
Where have you consulted uhm members from the other committees

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-043#31:1:C>
I think we do uh we have consulted uh other MPs uh and also
through the MPs to tell uh community so I am confident that this year's
slogan should be acceptable to all

<$D> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-043#32:1:D>
This year's campaign like that of the past couple of years has
tended to equate the learning of mandarin with the learning of Chinese
culture

<ICE-SIN:S1B-043#33:1:D>
Uh it there a danger over the years that the mandarin campaign has
lost its initial objective of replacing dialects instead of replacing English

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-043#34:1:C>
I think our basic aim is still the same uh we try to get
people to speak more mandarin instead of dialects

<$D> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-043#35:1:D>
Then how do you explain some of the activities during the
campaign like encouraging government office to speak uh mandarin to Chinese
Singaporeans regardless of whether they uh whether they can speak English or
not

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-043#36:1:C>
As the the survey uh reveals we have more and more Chinese
Singaporeans speaking uh man mandarin in fact even though the Chinese
Singaporeans may not uh completely speak fluent mandarin but they'll
understand it and uh they can speak some of it but only that uh they may not
feel too comfortable in doing so

<ICE-SIN:S1B-043#37:1:C>
Uh again I'm not uh saying that we are trying to replace English
with mandarin but if they are already familiar with the language and they
know a little bit of it then if they practice more they will speak better
that is the idea

<$D> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-043#38:1:D>
The prime minister said last week that the government will
begin to pay more attention to the Chinese educated segments of society

<ICE-SIN:S1B-043#39:1:D>
Uhm has this new policy affected the way in which this campaign
will be carried perhaps with more intensity

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-043#40:1:C>
I think the budget uh of the campaign is fixed we have people
uh sponsor activities during the campaign month but all in all we won't be
able to uh spend too much uh on media because campaign budget is fixed

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-043#41:1:A>
That was Henry Ng of MITA talking to Adrian Ong about this
year's speak mandarin campaign that'll be launched this coming Monday night

<ICE-SIN:S1B-043#42:1:A>
Ambassador-at-large professor Tommy Koh has said that Singapore
will continue to rely on oil and gas until further energy becomes
commercially attractive

<ICE-SIN:S1B-043#43:1:A>
Addressing the seventh Asia-Pacific Petroleum Conference yesterday
he gave five suggestions whereby Singapore can use energy more efficiently
and thus help the environment

<ICE-SIN:S1B-043#44:1:A>
Professor Koh who's also chairman of the preparatory committee of
the United Nations conference on environment and development told Jane Ong
what his five ideas are

<$E> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-043#45:1:E>
First I will like to see the ministry of the environment
working together with the national council on the environment and the
consumers uh uh association to promote green consumerism

<ICE-SIN:S1B-043#46:1:E>
What I mean is to educate the public so that the public will behave
in a more environmentally responsible way such as switching from ordinary
light bulbs to energy-saving bulbs and uh buying fuel efficient cars fuel
efficient refrigerators air-conditioners

<ICE-SIN:S1B-043#47:1:E>
Uh second I will like to see our architects design buildings which
are more suited to our climate you know buildings which are not intended for
air-conditioning should have more shade and cross ventilation

<ICE-SIN:S1B-043#48:1:E>
Then third I will like to see uh the air-conditioning engineers do
a better job than they do now

<ICE-SIN:S1B-043#49:1:E>
At the moment many of our indoor spaces are over-conditioned

<ICE-SIN:S1B-043#50:1:E>
Uh the other thing I want to suggest is that uh the PUB should see
how it can increase the thermal efficiency at their power plants which at the
moment is about 40 per cent which means that 60 per cent of the heat
generated has been lost

<ICE-SIN:S1B-043#51:1:E>
Finally I would uh like to commend the government for making
provisions in its concept plan for bike way but I want on behalf of the
cyclists in Singapore to make the point that at the moment our streets are
unsafe for cycling and I think there is no better way of transport than uh
the bicycle because it's a non-polluting uh vehicle

<$F> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-043#52:1:F>
How do you think we can actually put pressure on uhm the
concerned for these and parties for example the cyclists' pathways and in
encouraging people to rely less on air-conditioning

<ICE-SIN:S1B-043#53:1:F>
How do you think we can actually move these things on a much faster
pace

<$E> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-043#54:1:E>
Well the Ministry of the Environment is intending in fact to
uh initiate the campaign on green consumerism uh and I think that the
non-governmental organisations you know like uh the nature society the
national council of the environment uh the ministry education uh our junior
colleges or schools I think that and and and an environmentally jour
journalist you know that was recently uh formed uh a forum of uh
environmental journalists in Singapore I think that these people should come
together to educate the public

<ICE-SIN:S1B-043#55:1:E>
I I don't think you know it is helpful in Singapore to take a
confrontational attitude towards government and if it's unnecessary anyway
because the ministry of the environment is in fact taking the lead in many
fields you know so I think what we need to do is work together with the
ministry of the environment the ministry education

<$F> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-043#56:1:F>
On an industrial level how do you think environmentalists or
an environment concerned people in Singapore can work with the oil industry
for example which is so important here to ensure that uhm we have a safe a
good clean environment

<ICE-SIN:S1B-043#57:1:F>


<ICE-SIN:S1B-043#58:1:F>
I think that the national council of the environment uh should and
the nature's society should have a dialogue with the leaders of our oil
industry uh and uh I would myself like to promote such a dialogue

<$F> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-043#59:1:F>
Are you happy with what the oil industry has been

<$E> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-043#60:1:E>
Now uh I think the leadership of the major oil in uh companies
we have are in fact uh very responsive to the environmental concern so I
would say yes

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-043#61:1:A>
Professor Tommy Koh on saving energy and saving the
environment

<ICE-SIN:S1B-043#62:1:A>
The French minister of trade for foreign affairs Mr <unclear> word
</unclear> said that France is committed to the success of talks under the
general agreement on trade and tariffs

<ICE-SIN:S1B-043#63:1:A>
Along with the other members of the European community France has
has been accused of snagging the five year <unclear> word </umclear> round of
great Gatt talks

<ICE-SIN:S1B-043#64:1:A>
They've been criticised for refusing to cut back on subsidies to
its farmers

<ICE-SIN:S1B-043#65:1:A>
With Gatt talks resuming next month many of its members are not
optimistic that a conclusion would be reached before the end of the year

<ICE-SIN:S1B-043#66:1:A>
Jane Ong asked Mr who was here for a two-day visit if he holds the
same view

<$F> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-043#67:1:F>
So will France's conviction for this uhm talks to be
successfully concluded will that conviction include even giving in on the
issue of the farm subsidies which has been described as the stumbling block
so far

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-043#68:1:A>
And that was Mr the French minister of trade for foreign
affairs who left Singapore for Paris last night

<ICE-SIN:S1B-043#69:1:A>
And coming up next on AM Singapore making a phone call from the air

<ICE-SIN:S1B-043#70:1:A>
Singapore airlines passenger will no longer have to wait before
landing to make a phone call

<ICE-SIN:S1B-043#71:1:A>
SIA has just launched a new air to ground phone service called
Cetestial that can be used by its long-distance passengers

<ICE-SIN:S1B-043#72:1:A>
We join Shangi Barachargi on her first attempt at making the
celestial phone call

<$G> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-043#73:1:G>
Hello I'm Shangi Barachargi I'm calling you from thirty-five
thousand feet above South China Sea through celestial SIA's new service for
its passengers able to reach anywhere in the world

<ICE-SIN:S1B-043#74:1:G>
The service will be available on all SIA's long-distance flights by
1994

<ICE-SIN:S1B-043#75:1:G>
Now sitting next to me is SIA's marketing uh director of marketing
services Mr Joseph Chew

<ICE-SIN:S1B-043#76:1:G>
Good morning Mr Chew

<ICE-SIN:S1B-043#77:1:G>
Now Mr Chew celestial looks like a rather ordinary cordless
telephone but how does the system actually work

<$H> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-043#78:1:H>
Well the celestial is the high phone service from SIA and it
works quite simply via satellite

<ICE-SIN:S1B-043#79:1:H>
You make a call from the cabin <unclear> word </unclear> via the
satellite through to the ground telecommunicative system through three
outstations like <unclear> word </unclear> in the UK <unclear> word
</unclear> in Norway and Sentosa in Singapore

<$G> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-043#80:1:G>
Now this phone call is costing us about 15 Singapore dollars
for every minute even this rate's rather steep for the average uhm passenger

<$H> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-043#81:1:H>
Well we have looked into this cost but really the element of
cost uh does not arise because this is a service that we are providing to
passengers uh and we believe that this is an integral part of service that we
want to extend to enhance our service

<$G> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-043#82:1:G>
How many people do you see using this service and who will
they be

<$H> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-043#83:1:H>
We do not know exactly how many passengers would like to use
it but we figure it would be very popular among the business people business
travellers and even the family man who's travelling on board <X>

<ICE-SIN:S1B-043#X84:1:H>
Now only a fifteen Singapore dollars is rather steep is there a
possibility of introducing an off-peak pricing system At the moment we're not
sure whether there will be an off-peak uh rate uh all we can say is that the
rate is calculated <unclear> word </unclear> a very nominal basis Now uh I
understand that this is a first of SIA's uhm new services to to developing a
total visit centre for its passengers

<ICE-SIN:S1B-043#X85:1:H>
Now the other thing is back and the date transition centres when
do you see this coming on line Well celestial is the first uh first at stage
next we believe we will introduce the fax services and real time uh news
financial services and health services probably in two within two years uh it
seems that we're running out of time at the moment so we have to end the
interview there thank you very much mr chew for your company and so with that
I'm here on sq 888 with Elnor Nair and Chirstina Eng back in the studio and
that was with how you could sound like at thirty nine thousand feet in the
clouds well with that it's time to come down to earth I'm Alna Nair with
producer Christian Eng and we'll be back again tomorrow with am Singapore if
you happen to be at one of those flights at seven fifteen am why not give us
a call at 3503676 that's 3503676 </X> </I>
