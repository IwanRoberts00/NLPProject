On AM Singapore this morning how will the Hisbollah retaliate
Israel's assassination of its leader

<ICE-SIN:S1B-050#2:1:A>
But why did Israel do it in the first place

<ICE-SIN:S1B-050#3:1:A>
And Asia's upcoming Tiger Vietnam assures its commitment to foreign
investors

<ICE-SIN:S1B-050#4:1:A>
Good morning I'm Eleanor Nair

<ICE-SIN:S1B-050#5:1:A>
Iran has strongly condemned Israel for killing the leader of the
pro-Iranian Hisbollah movement Sheikh Masawi in Lebanon

<ICE-SIN:S1B-050#6:1:A>
The Sheikh his wife their young son and bodyguards died when Israeli
helicopters attacked the convoy of vehicles in which they were travelling

<ICE-SIN:S1B-050#7:1:A>
As tens of thousands attended the funeral of Sheikh Masawi the
foreign ministry in Tehran has called the killing a terrorist act and has
also accused the United States of supporting Israel's action

<ICE-SIN:S1B-050#8:1:A>
Most of southern Lebanon was reported to be tense and Hisbollah has
vowed to take revenge but what are they likely to do

<ICE-SIN:S1B-050#9:1:A>
Earlier this morning Pek Siok Lian spoke to James O'Connor an expert
on terrorism from Bradford University

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-050#10:1:B>
Part of the reason for the Israeli attacks has been the
feeling of frustration in Israel about the lack of progress on the issue of
the missing airman Ran Ahrad

<ICE-SIN:S1B-050#11:1:B>
Is it fair to say now that his fate is now sealed <X>

<ICE-SIN:S1B-050#X12:1:B>
JC </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-050#13:1:B>
But is it only Israel which is likely to be responsible for
the death of Sheikh Habas or will the US also be blamed because of their
continued support for Israel <X>

<ICE-SIN:S1B-050#X14:1:B>
JC </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-050#15:1:B>
So you don't think that American installations could also be
targets for possible retaliation <X>

<ICE-SIN:S1B-050#X16:1:B>
JC </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-050#17:1:B>
But to what extent is the Hisbollah free to retaliate on its
own as opposed to getting its go-ahead and direction from Tehran <X>

<ICE-SIN:S1B-050#X18:1:B>
JC </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-050#19:1:B>
But Iran has clearly been trying to improve its international
standing over the past couple of years so do you think that President
Rafsanjani do you think he'll be now in a dilemma in that he has to show
support for Hisbollah and yet not do so at the expense of angering the West
too much <X>

<ICE-SIN:S1B-050#X20:1:B>
JC </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-050#21:1:B>
But do you think that Iran will only give the impression of
supporting their Muslim constituencies since it was not much appreciated by
the West during the Gulf War as well as when they stuck out their necks in
working for the release of Western hostages <X>

<ICE-SIN:S1B-050#X22:1:B>
JC </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-050#23:1:A>
So how will Israel respond in the likelihood of an Hisbollah
attack but first how did this whole vendetta start

<ICE-SIN:S1B-050#24:1:A>
But why did the Israelis do what they did at the expense of the
peace talks and what fate will that ultimately spell for the Middle East
peace process

<ICE-SIN:S1B-050#25:1:A>
Daud Kutap a journalist from the Middle East International talked
to Peck Siok Lian from Jerusalem

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-050#26:1:B>
But apart from the pride of the military being hurt do you
think that the attack was a deliberate Israeli attempt to scuff the peace
process <X>

<ICE-SIN:S1B-050#X27:1:B>
DK </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-050#28:1:B>
So you think the peace process can survive despite this
obvious upset <X>

<ICE-SIN:S1B-050#X29:1:B>
DK </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-050#30:1:B>
The Israelis have warned that the army is also to strike back
harshly should Hisbollah retaliate

<ICE-SIN:S1B-050#31:1:B>
Now how how fast and where are they likely to first strike back <X>

<ICE-SIN:S1B-050#X32:1:B>
DK </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-050#33:1:A>
And that was Daud Kutap of the Middel East International

<ICE-SIN:S1B-050#34:1:A>
You've been listening to AM Singapore

<ICE-SIN:S1B-050#35:1:A>
It's now twenty five minutes past seven

<ICE-SIN:S1B-050#36:1:A>
Vietnam's efforts to move foreign capital and technology into the
country has paid off handsomely so far

<ICE-SIN:S1B-050#37:1:A>
Since nineteen eighty eight there's been a three-fold increase in
the volume of foreign investments

<ICE-SIN:S1B-050#38:1:A>
By the end of last year more than three hundred projects were in
excess of US two point five billion dollars have poured in

<ICE-SIN:S1B-050#39:1:A>
Now one of the factors that's led to this inflow is its liberal
foreign investment flaw which was amended in nineteen ninety

<ICE-SIN:S1B-050#40:1:A>
It allows for private companies to establish bus business ventures
with foreign investors

<ICE-SIN:S1B-050#41:1:A>
Of the thirty four countries putting their investment dollar there
Taiwan Hong Kong Australia and France are the main contributors and more
Asian and Western countries are rushing in to get a piece of the action
despite a US economic embargo

<ICE-SIN:S1B-050#42:1:A>
So in view of its western-styled economic reforms how important is
it for Vietnam to normalise ties with the US now

<ICE-SIN:S1B-050#43:1:A>
<unclear> word </unclear> Zainal Abidin spoke to Madam Ngoh Ba Tan
Vietnam's parliamentarian and chairwoman of its local mission at a business
conference yesterday

<ICE-SIN:S1B-050#44:1:A>
She's here to promote investments from Singapore

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-050#45:1:C>
Now surely uhm we understand that the Americans' trade embargo
is tied also to the uh the fact that uh excess of funds from international
financial organisations are not able to reach Vietnam and these is important
for Vietnam because of its lacking of capital

<ICE-SIN:S1B-050#46:1:C>
So ah is the Vietnamese uh side doing anything to to ensure
relations get normalised soon <X>

<ICE-SIN:S1B-050#X47:1:C>
NBT </X>

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-050#48:1:C>
So in other words you're saying that you're putting aside the
uh matter of uh normalising relations with Vietnam and looking forward to
extending relations with other nations perhaps with uh ASEAN you know how
important is ASEAN to uh Vietnam's effort to stimulate its economy right now
<X>

<ICE-SIN:S1B-050#X49:1:C>
NBT </X>

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-050#50:1:C>
So when do you think you'll be ready to join ASEAN <X>

<ICE-SIN:S1B-050#X51:1:C>
NBT </X>

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-050#52:1:C>
But what about the capitalistic system that is operating in
the ASEAN economies I mean uh which is still very new uh or Vietnam is still
learning about this system so how long will it take for Vietnam to to get
into this uh market economy or capitalistic economy so to speak

<ICE-SIN:S1B-050#53:1:C>
Well the economic process in Vietnam has been going on since
nineteen eighty six when it first introduced its own concept of economic
renovation or better known as doi moi and to further liberalise its economy
the Vietnamese National Assembly will next month pass a new constitution to
protect foreign interest from political interference

<ICE-SIN:S1B-050#54:1:C>
This will guarantee any legal assets and properties belonging to
foreign investors from being nationalised

<ICE-SIN:S1B-050#55:1:C>
But will the new constitution be binding Madam Ngoh Ba Tan <X>

<ICE-SIN:S1B-050#X56:1:C>
NBT </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-050#57:1:A>
And that was Ngoh Ba Tan chairwoman of Vietnam's local mission
speaking to Zainal Abidin on its commitment to foreign investors

<ICE-SIN:S1B-050#58:1:A>
And that's all on our program this morning AM Singapore will be
back again same time tomorrow with more stories behind the news

<ICE-SIN:S1B-050#59:1:A>
From producer Peck Siok Lian and I Eleanor Nair goodbye </I>

<ICE-SIN:S1B-050#61:2:D>
The British general election will be held on April the ninth

<ICE-SIN:S1B-050#62:2:D>
This has been much expected after Chancellor Norman Lermon
presented what he called a budget for recovery for recession hit Britian

<ICE-SIN:S1B-050#63:2:D>
This will be one of the closest election campaigns in Britian since
World War Two

<ICE-SIN:S1B-050#64:2:D>
Britian's economy is at an all time low since the recession in the
nineteen thirties

<ICE-SIN:S1B-050#65:2:D>
So who will win will depend on who can best fix the economy

<ICE-SIN:S1B-050#66:2:D>
The Conservative party led by Mr Major is also under pressure to
win a historic fourth term in office but it seems to be going into the
campaign trailing Labour

<ICE-SIN:S1B-050#67:2:D>
The latest opinion poll shows the Labour party stealing a three
point lead with forty-two per cent of the vote against thirty-nine per cent
for the Conservatives

<ICE-SIN:S1B-050#68:2:D>
To find out more about the British election Karen Won was on the
line with Alan Beatty of the London School of Economics earlier this morning

<$E> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-050#69:2:E>
Now over the recent months Mr Major has brought the
Conservative Party very much to the centre away from the extreme right wing

<ICE-SIN:S1B-050#70:2:E>
Will this accommodative style actually work to his advantage or
disadvantage you think <X>

<ICE-SIN:S1B-050#X71:2:E>
AB </X>

<$E> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-050#72:2:E>
If indeed economic issues would take centre stage in this
election is the Labour party able to come up with an attractive counter
budget tailored for the ballot box as the Conservative Party has done <X>

<ICE-SIN:S1B-050#X73:2:E>
AB </X>

<$E> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-050#74:2:E>
But what about the personalities of the candidate

<ICE-SIN:S1B-050#75:2:E>
Do you think that uhm that would become an issue for example will
Mr Major be able to move out from under the shadow of Margaret Thatcher to
win a sizeable amount of votes <X>

<ICE-SIN:S1B-050#X76:2:E>
AB </X>

<$E> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-050#77:2:E>
Now uh looking at the polls recently it does seems that uhm
this is going to be a very close and exciting fight between the two parties

<ICE-SIN:S1B-050#78:2:E>
Now do you think that a coalition government will become a
possibility <X>

<ICE-SIN:S1B-050#X79:2:E>
AB </X>

<$E> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-050#80:2:E>
So what role do you think uhm the liberal democratic party
will play in the process <X>

<ICE-SIN:S1B-050#X81:2:E>
AB </X>

<$D> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-050#82:2:D>
And that was Alan Beatty of the London School of Economics

<ICE-SIN:S1B-050#83:2:D>
And the time now is twenty-three past seven

<ICE-SIN:S1B-050#84:2:D>
We turn to home next for a visit to the careers exhibition

<ICE-SIN:S1B-050#85:2:D>
Home of opportunities

<ICE-SIN:S1B-050#86:2:D>
That's hall three at the uh at the World Trade Centre where the
career ninety-two exhibition open yesterday

<ICE-SIN:S1B-050#87:2:D>
There students and young adults can shop for a job at any booth set
up by the many industries which will offer information on what it takes to
make it in most if not all careers

<ICE-SIN:S1B-050#88:2:D>
For companies too it's a golden opportunity to recruit some
urgently needed staff from the show's heavy turn out

<ICE-SIN:S1B-050#89:2:D>
And some of them even handled out on the spot job applications

<ICE-SIN:S1B-050#90:2:D>
But for some sectors getting the right staff means giving or doing
a lot more than just participating in career exhibitions as Zainal Abidin
finds out

<$F> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-050#91:2:F>
I'm now at the Career ' 92 exhibition here at the World Trade
Centre

<ICE-SIN:S1B-050#92:2:F>
There's quite a good spread of industries that are represented here

<ICE-SIN:S1B-050#93:2:F>
Everyone equipped with their best possible paraphernalia and the
promotional gadgetry trying to compete or capture the mostly young hearts in
mind that have come in large numbers to see what's in store for them in the
times to come

<ICE-SIN:S1B-050#94:2:F>
But the question that comes to my mind is how do the essential
services such as the police force the health care and the teaching profession
compete with other private companies which tend to be considered more
glamourous for the best minds and bodies to come into the profession

<ICE-SIN:S1B-050#95:2:F>
Well first uh I spoke to Mrs Tan Siew Kuan whose the spokesperson
for the police force

<$G> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-050#96:2:G>
Uh you'll notice that we we have a very large crowd today here
and uh year by year we have in fact been if I may say the most popular booth

<ICE-SIN:S1B-050#97:2:G>
Uh one of the reasons is because basically the inherent nature of
the job of the police is in itself very interesting very challenging very
varied

<ICE-SIN:S1B-050#98:2:G>
So because of these people are attracted by the the job the job
itself

<ICE-SIN:S1B-050#99:2:G>
Secondly our salaries are very competitive in terms of its uh entry
points in terms of uh its uhm I would say salary scales

<ICE-SIN:S1B-050#100:2:G>
Yah we are very very competitive

<$F> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-050#101:2:F>
But it's to my knowledge that the police force is also facing
a shortage of staff or difficulty in recruiting the right staff into the
force

<ICE-SIN:S1B-050#102:2:F>
Now how does it attract uhm or how does it compete for the uh
brains to come into the police force instead of going to other companies like
the Singapore Airlines or the the TDB or any other large corporations

<$G> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-050#103:2:G>
Uh I would I would say that in terms of the people who wanted
to join the police we have no difficulty getting the numbers uh neither do we
have difficulty getting the right type of people

<ICE-SIN:S1B-050#104:2:G>
In fact uh last year we had uh for junior officers we have four
thousand six hundred and fifty-six applications

<ICE-SIN:S1B-050#105:2:G>
For senior officers we have about hundred and forty-six
applications

<ICE-SIN:S1B-050#106:2:G>
Uh it is not that we are shortage of we have uh we are shortage of
staff it's more of the fact that our uh our resig uh our retirement rate is
very high

<ICE-SIN:S1B-050#107:2:G>
Alright over the next few years in fact this year we will have
four hundred JOs who will be retiring when they reach their retirement age
limit so we need to recruit very large numbers to replace these retired
officers

<$F> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-050#108:2:F>
So do you think you'll be able to do that through this uh
exhibition and other promotional uh efforts

<$G> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-050#109:2:G>
Yes uh basically the number of people who actually are
attracted to join the police are people who come to the career exhibition
year by year and also through our press advertisements the respondents to our
press advertisements

<ICE-SIN:S1B-050#110:2:G>
Basically these two avenues are the are the places where large
numbers will apply

<$F> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-050#111:2:F>
But when they join do they stay long

<$G> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-050#112:2:G>
Yes they would alright they would stay for long because we
have a proper career development system for them yah <X>

<$F> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-050#X113:2:F>
Joining me now is Major Wong Wai Leong head of uh
recruitment I believe in the Singapore Arm Forces Em what do you think or
what do you think you would need to do to bet <unclear> word </unclear> to
get the best mind into the Arm Forces considering the fact there's very tight
labour market and great competition from private corporations em around here
in Singapore? WWL: We're aware that the labour market is very tight and very
competitive and that's the reason why the SAF has actually restructed the uh
non-commission uh officer core Uh we have now two uh new core one is the
specialist core and the other is the warrants officers' core Alright uh with
this two new core we aim to attract you know uh better uh educated personnel
to join the SAF And at the same time this people will be groom for uh higher
appointments and at the and also to ensure that they are promoted you know
fast enough so as to ensure that they would stay on in the Arm Forces

<$F> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-050#X114:2:F>
In tangible terms what do you think are the real benefits or
incentives that uh the new recruits can look to when they join the Arm
Forces? WWL: I think in terms of salary the SAF actually offers a very good
uh terms in the sense that uh our salary is as good is uh at least twenty per
cent more than the uh civil service right and uh we also continual
continually uh study the market condition and review our term and terms and
conditions as and when necessary

<$F> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-050#X115:2:F>
That was Major Wong Wai Leong talking to me earlier on at
this very impressive uh SAF uh counter or booth </X> </I>
