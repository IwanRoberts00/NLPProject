<ICE-SIN:S2A-044#1:1:A>
Good afternoon uh ladies and gentlemen

<ICE-SIN:S2A-044#2:1:A>
My name uh is Ding Hock Hui

<ICE-SIN:S2A-044#3:1:A>
I'm a senior quantity surveyor from the Quantative Surveying uh
Office in P W D

<ICE-SIN:S2A-044#4:1:A>
So I'll be talking on uh quantity surveying services if you join uh
P W D uh as quantity surveyors what you will do in P W D

<ICE-SIN:S2A-044#5:1:A>
I think most of us are familiar with this uh organisation chart
typical projecting uh where you have the client the architect contractor
sub-contractors as well as a range of uh consultants that uh involve in the
job appointed by the client to get a project going

<ICE-SIN:S2A-044#6:1:A>
So the quantity surveyor as you can see is one of the project uh
consultants involve in the job uh assisting the architect

<ICE-SIN:S2A-044#7:1:A>
And you may have other allied professionals like structural civil
engineers uhm mechanical and electrical engineers as well as uh other
specialist consultants could have for interior design consultant <unclear>
word </unclear> consultant who are involve in the job

<ICE-SIN:S2A-044#8:1:A>
This is the project team who will handle the project right from the
outset

<ICE-SIN:S2A-044#9:1:A>
The project team objective basically as far as I can see uh centred
around uh three areas time control cost control and quality control

<ICE-SIN:S2A-044#10:1:A>
You try to get the project completed on time within a specified uh
programme within uh certain budgeted cost as well as to certain uh quality
standard

<ICE-SIN:S2A-044#11:1:A>
And what is the quantity surveyor's role

<ICE-SIN:S2A-044#12:1:A>
Basically is to safeguard uh government financial interest to make
sure that uh money are well spent for the project

<ICE-SIN:S2A-044#13:1:A>
And also to ensure that the public construction contract are
procured in compliance with certain regulations

<ICE-SIN:S2A-044#14:1:A>
Uh which uh the main in purpose of this regulation is to ensure
that the projects are procured lah with uh in accordance with uh certain
rules

<ICE-SIN:S2A-044#15:1:A>
So that they are transparent nobody can fault them and uh complain
can be uh answered easily

<ICE-SIN:S2A-044#16:1:A>
What then are the Q S functions

<ICE-SIN:S2A-044#17:1:A>
If you're employed as a quantity surveyor in P W D these are the
basic functions that uh you probably be performing

<ICE-SIN:S2A-044#18:1:A>
You'll be making uh cost estimates plans or cost plans for a
project

<ICE-SIN:S2A-044#19:1:A>
You work the estimated cost for budgeting purposes

<ICE-SIN:S2A-044#20:1:A>
Once uh the estimates are approved the money is allocated

<ICE-SIN:S2A-044#21:1:A>
You proceed to call tenders that means you prepare your tender
documents

<ICE-SIN:S2A-044#22:1:A>
You will uh proceed to call tenders after the documents have been
prepared lah

<ICE-SIN:S2A-044#23:1:A>
In certain cases for large projects you'll have this P Q we call it
prequalification exercises

<ICE-SIN:S2A-044#24:1:A>
That means uh contractors will be pre-qualified tenders

<ICE-SIN:S2A-044#25:1:A>
We will narrow down contractors to those who are qualified to be
invited to tender

<ICE-SIN:S2A-044#26:1:A>
After tenders are called we have this tender evaluation
recommendation of the tender to the client

<ICE-SIN:S2A-044#27:1:A>
And uh after the tenders have been approved it is awarded to the
successful contractor

<ICE-SIN:S2A-044#28:1:A>
And uh fol following then we have contract documentation uh we
document a contract that will be the basis to to base uh to to work out the
contractual arrangement between a contractor and P W D

<ICE-SIN:S2A-044#29:1:A>
And uh after the award of the contract we have contract
administration that means uh we will uh make uh interim payment valuation to
the contractors whether it's on monthly basis or on a stage payment basis

<ICE-SIN:S2A-044#30:1:A>
We also work out the variations that are ordered uh during the cost
of the work for the purpose of uh cost control

<ICE-SIN:S2A-044#31:1:A>
We want to make sure that the the project budget or the contract
sum is not exceeded

<ICE-SIN:S2A-044#32:1:A>
We also finalise the account after a contract is completed uh at
the end of the project after <unclear> word </unclear> <unclear> word
</unclear> certified

<ICE-SIN:S2A-044#33:1:A>
And of course but not the least you see in every contract
invariably there will be uh some contractual dispute

<ICE-SIN:S2A-044#34:1:A>
Maybe uh certain specifications or certain contractual provisions
are not uh adequately drafted and there will be uh such contract dispute
arising

<ICE-SIN:S2A-044#35:1:A>
And uh as the quantity surveyor for the job uh it is our duty to
advice the architects the engineers you see what is the view you see on uh
certain aspect regarding the contractor's claims

<ICE-SIN:S2A-044#36:1:A>
There right in addition to those basic Q S functions some other Q S
functions that we do for example just now you have seen on the side uh this
cost information quarterly is a publication of cost information

<ICE-SIN:S2A-044#37:1:A>
Uh which uh we uh make every quarter and which is available for
sale to the public

<ICE-SIN:S2A-044#38:1:A>
In this publication you'll be able to find information like uh cost
indices of uh tenders or building materials or labour cost

<ICE-SIN:S2A-044#39:1:A>
So that the the general industry the construction industry can
refer to it and use it as a reference guide you see to let them have a feel
of uh the trend of prices

<ICE-SIN:S2A-044#40:1:A>
Whether tender prices are going up or going down or whether
material prices are going up or down

<ICE-SIN:S2A-044#41:1:A>
That's uh cost information quarterly is available for sale to the
public and it is published every quarter okay

<ICE-SIN:S2A-044#42:1:A>
The next thing we do we also provide uh insurance and compensation
valuation for the Commissioner of Land

<ICE-SIN:S2A-044#43:1:A>
Uh this is for the purpose of uh the land acquisition act

<ICE-SIN:S2A-044#44:1:A>
You know there is in Singapore we have this uh land acquisition act

<ICE-SIN:S2A-044#45:1:A>
If property is uh acquired by the government compensation is
payable to the land owner at certain pre-determined prices at certain age
whether it's nineteen seventy-three nineteen eighty-six

<ICE-SIN:S2A-044#46:1:A>
We will be able to be we are able to provide uh advice to the
Commissioner of Land who's the one acquiring the property

<ICE-SIN:S2A-044#47:1:A>
What is the value of that property at certain point in time whether
it's nineteen seventy-three or eighty-six or even at current market value

<ICE-SIN:S2A-044#48:1:A>
For insurance uh valuation it is for the purpose of uh insuring a
property uh for fire uh for against damage by fire

<ICE-SIN:S2A-044#49:1:A>
So this is required before any property is let out to the public

<ICE-SIN:S2A-044#50:1:A>
We'll also provide advice on capital grant projects

<ICE-SIN:S2A-044#51:1:A>
That means uh this capital grant projects are basically uh Ministry
of Education uh projects aided-school projects where the government provides
ninety per cent of the funds to this uh aided mission

<ICE-SIN:S2A-044#52:1:A>
Uh since the money the bulk of the money comes from the government
in building the aided uh schools the mission schools we definitely will have
to have a say to help uh Ministry of Education uh how to run these projects
what sort of policies to follow

<ICE-SIN:S2A-044#53:1:A>
And we have a team of uh people to sit in these committees to
advice the aided school mission uh how projects are to be uh administered

<ICE-SIN:S2A-044#54:1:A>
The types of projects that you'll be involved in as a quantity
surveyor in P W D you have seen uh some of the slide just now these are some
of the projects that uh I summarise here

<ICE-SIN:S2A-044#55:1:A>
Civil for civil engineering projects you have uh projects like road
expressways flyovers interchanges underpasses tunnels <unclear> word
</unclear> bridges walkways

<ICE-SIN:S2A-044#56:1:A>
And uh account for building projects uh you've seen a wide range of
them on the slides

<ICE-SIN:S2A-044#57:1:A>
Building projects uh we have schools junior colleges prisons E R C
drug-rehabilitation centres airport abdominal <unclear> word </unclear> tree
offices polyclinics office-buildings

<ICE-SIN:S2A-044#58:1:A>
Singapore Art-centre that's coming up uh very soon libraries and
other institu ah institutional facilities like immigration centres police uh
headquarters or police post

<ICE-SIN:S2A-044#59:1:A>
Apart from uh the projects that uh you'll be applying expertise
what you're trained

<ICE-SIN:S2A-044#60:1:A>
You also we also uh to your training and development needs if you
join the service as a quantity surveyor

<ICE-SIN:S2A-044#61:1:A>
Uh opportunities will be given to you to be trained in uh your
basic Q S functions uh all those that uh I've uh spoken just now as well as
uh matters relating to contract law arbitration

<ICE-SIN:S2A-044#62:1:A>
Just one area that uh further development training and development
will be given to you as well as uh in computers uh

<ICE-SIN:S2A-044#63:1:A>
We have actually an in in-house uh quantity surveying system uh
that helps you to carry out your duties more effectively using computers

<ICE-SIN:S2A-044#64:1:A>
Uh these are on technical uh issues but on management we'll also
send our staff for supervisory management as well as uh organisation and
methods

<ICE-SIN:S2A-044#65:1:A>
You'll be given uh you'll be given opportunities to attend uh
training in these areas

<ICE-SIN:S2A-044#66:1:A>
The forms of training you could be attending seminars conferences
symposium

<ICE-SIN:S2A-044#67:1:A>
Symposiums are basically uh a forum where uh the experts will put
up some papers and they will deliver it at that symposium and you will have
the opportunity to participate in those uh discussions and forums

<ICE-SIN:S2A-044#68:1:A>
Of course uh there's more hands-on uh opportunities in the form of
workshop practical attachments

<ICE-SIN:S2A-044#69:1:A>
You could be given opportunities to be attached to a foreign firm
in another country uh for some specific purpose to learn a certain uh area of
work practical attachments

<ICE-SIN:S2A-044#70:1:A>
Sometimes you'll also have the opportunity to have study visits
like uh for Singapore Art Centre teams of uh professionals of P W D were
given opportunity to visit uh various uh art centres in other countries like
uh in the U K Europe as well as America even for the development of the
airport terminal two

<ICE-SIN:S2A-044#71:1:A>
Uh opportunities were also given to those staff who were involved
in the airport development to visit various airports around the world before
we actually uh do our own uh design

<ICE-SIN:S2A-044#72:1:A>
So you'll be given opportunity to have practical attachments study
visits

<ICE-SIN:S2A-044#73:1:A>
And of course last but not least uh you have this structured
learning programme where you can go for your Masters courses M B

<ICE-SIN:S2A-044#74:1:A>
As and uh if possible also your P H D

<ICE-SIN:S2A-044#75:1:A>
Okay that more or less concludes my section on quantity surveying
</I>


<I>

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-044#76:2:B>
Hi I'm Lim Hock Chuan from the Public Service Commission

<ICE-SIN:S2A-044#77:2:B>
Uhm before I start it's good to see you smiling

<ICE-SIN:S2A-044#78:2:B>
Before I start can I just have a quick show of hand how many of you
are from the Architecture School

<ICE-SIN:S2A-044#79:2:B>
Okay so the bulk of them is for Q S jobs uh

<ICE-SIN:S2A-044#80:2:B>
Okay uh after listening to my from uhm P W D I'm sure by now you
have a good idea of uh the kind of jobs that are available for you as
architects as quantity surveyors

<ICE-SIN:S2A-044#81:2:B>
Uhm whether you're involve in uh the design or the cost control of
say schools or airport or hospitals or bridges

<ICE-SIN:S2A-044#82:2:B>
Whether your work entails uh uh design or retrofitting or
conservation or renovation

<ICE-SIN:S2A-044#83:2:B>
Whether it's a procurement of contracts or contract administration
there is a exciting uh career for you in the P W D either as a architect or
as a quantity surveyor that will meet your aspirations and qualifications

<ICE-SIN:S2A-044#84:2:B>
So these are very good professional reasons why you should join at
the P W D but for the next five minutes

<ICE-SIN:S2A-044#85:2:B>
Or so you I just want to touch on some uh more down to earth reason
close to heart reasons why you should join us

<ICE-SIN:S2A-044#86:2:B>
Now what sort of uh salaries would you are we talking about if you
join us uh as a quantity surveyor

<ICE-SIN:S2A-044#87:2:B>
Okay the present starting salary for a quantity surveyor is a
thousand eight hundred and eighty for uh ladies and guys who have not done
national service

<ICE-SIN:S2A-044#88:2:B>
And for those who have done national service uh presently the
salary is two thousand hundred and forty dollars

<ICE-SIN:S2A-044#89:2:B>
Uhm this is the present salary I uh sure that you've heard the
announcement made by the prime minister about a month so ago that the civil
service salary will be review at the end of the year

<ICE-SIN:S2A-044#90:2:B>
And we look forward to a revision upwards at the end of the year

<ICE-SIN:S2A-044#91:2:B>
And so we could be talking about salaries that are that are a bit
higher than these in terms of starting salaries okay

<ICE-SIN:S2A-044#92:2:B>
Now what about promotional prospects

<ICE-SIN:S2A-044#93:2:B>
Okay you join us as a quantity surveyor at uh thousand eight two
thousand one and upon first promotion we are talking about a salary at least
of three thousand three hundred and twenty-five uh upon first promotion okay
<X>

<ICE-SIN:S2A-044#X94:2:B>
And of course you go up the second promotion it starts from four
thousand to about five thousand and all the way to uh of the top post which
is about fourteen thousand dollars But like I used to tell the other group
there's only one top post okay Uh so if you don't make it to the top so maybe
you're stuck somewhere in the middle I would say about eight thousand dollars
Well that's that's not too bad okay So this is for the uh quantity surveyors
How about architects for the four or five of you who are with us? Because
your course is longer uhm you start at a higher salary uhm For those without
N S you start at two thousand and ten and those with N S two thousand two
hundred and sixty-five dollars Okay this is your starting salary </X> </I>
