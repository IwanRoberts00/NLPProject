<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-005#1:1:A>
Now I'll fill you on with uhm the addition reactions

<ICE-SIN:S1B-005#2:1:A>
Well you addition reactions are not typical reactions of aromatic
compounds that or you have seen so uhm addition reactions are not the typical
reactions of aromatic compounds

<ICE-SIN:S1B-005#3:1:A>
Uh but of the three five methods hetrocyclic compounds furan uhm
thiophen and pyrrole I have pointed out to you that furan is of the lowest uh
aromaticity it's the least aromatic of the three

<ICE-SIN:S1B-005#4:1:A>
So you find that there are efficient reactions taking place in furan
alright and this is because of its low aromatic character and uhm and
indicates that furan tends to behave like a diene alright that's when it's
not behaving like an aromatic compound alright

<ICE-SIN:S1B-005#5:1:A>
This is furan uhm both of their electrons are opposed donated they
are donated to the ring system in order that the compound possess six pie
electrons alright required by aromatic sets <unclear> word </unclear> you
note that if you mix these whole <unclear> word </unclear> the subsequent
kenonical structures would have a positive charge on oxygen right which is
not favourable for furan

<ICE-SIN:S1B-005#6:1:A>
So because of that furan would rather not have alright the charge
oxygen right it would tend to remain in its neutral form alright and in this
way it will behave like a diene alright

<ICE-SIN:S1B-005#7:1:A>
This is the diene component

<ICE-SIN:S1B-005#8:1:A>
Now there are many examples of furan behaving as a diene chemically
uhm these are some of them

<ICE-SIN:S1B-005#9:1:A>
Can you see

<ICE-SIN:S1B-005#10:1:A>
Is it too light is it

<ICE-SIN:S1B-005#11:1:A>
Can you see from behind

<ICE-SIN:S1B-005#12:1:A>
You can't ah

<ICE-SIN:S1B-005#13:1:A>
Would it help if I turn off the light right

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-005#14:1:B>
Right

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-005#15:1:A>
So we have first of all the nitration of furan the nitration
of furan uhm nitration is carried out using what is this reagent uhm Ee Lee

<ICE-SIN:S1B-005#16:1:A>
It's the usual nitrating reagent for the hetrocyclic compound Chek
Yu

<ICE-SIN:S1B-005#17:1:A>
Ahum Tin Wee

<ICE-SIN:S1B-005#18:1:A>
This is the

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-005#19:1:C>
Nitronium acetate

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-005#20:1:A>
Nitronium acetate acetile nitrate alright quite close alright

<ICE-SIN:S1B-005#21:1:A>
Acetile nitrate and it is uhm nitrating agent for all these five
hetrocycles because for what reason

<ICE-SIN:S1B-005#22:1:A>
Ming Seng

<ICE-SIN:S1B-005#23:1:A>
Because it is weakly acidic alright you cannot afford to use uhm
nitric acid <unclear> word </unclear> nitric acid and sulphuric acid for the
nitration reactions so acetile nitrate is used because of its low acidity

<ICE-SIN:S1B-005#24:1:A>
Right so what do we have

<ICE-SIN:S1B-005#25:1:A>
Uhm now you find that for furan reaction with acetyl nitrate does
not give them nitrofuran as expected

<ICE-SIN:S1B-005#26:1:A>
Instead the product of reaction is a two five adduct right having
the structure

<ICE-SIN:S1B-005#27:1:A>
So you see this is the nitronium ion that was originally added on
alright and you find that there is a acetyl <unclear> word </unclear> that is
attached onto the other terminal carbon which came from the acetate and ion
alright there is a two five adduct that is formed

<ICE-SIN:S1B-005#28:1:A>
This two five adduct is not very stable and on uh treatment and on
heating or pyridine treatment with pyridine the acetyl <unclear> word
</unclear> is lost as acidic acid and this will regenerate nitrofuran right
which is the product that one expects first

<ICE-SIN:S1B-005#29:1:A>
Now why is it that the reaction follows this rather odd course
observed here

<ICE-SIN:S1B-005#30:1:A>
Now the mechanism of the reaction is shown

<ICE-SIN:S1B-005#31:1:A>
Well initially there would be an addition of the nitronium ion
right like in the in this manner uh something that you are familiar with

<ICE-SIN:S1B-005#32:1:A>
The charge alright would be delocalised

<ICE-SIN:S1B-005#33:1:A>
The positive charge would be delocalised on this carbon this carbon
and then on the oxygen which we know is of lowest stability because of the
charge of oxygen

<ICE-SIN:S1B-005#34:1:A>
Now remember that when the nitronium ion goes and attack the carbon
there is still the acetate that remains behind and the acetate and ion can
act as a nucleophile alright so it will attack the positive centre on the
carbon on a nucleus

<ICE-SIN:S1B-005#35:1:A>
Well this may not be sterically favourable alright this position
may not be sterically favourable this one further away from the nitro would
be more suitable and this is what happens

<ICE-SIN:S1B-005#36:1:A>
The acetate then goes in into this position and you have your
adduct formed alright in this way right

<ICE-SIN:S1B-005#37:1:A>
So we have the nitronium ion and uhm this way

<ICE-SIN:S1B-005#38:1:A>
In another words there are two alternative pathways which this
nitronium which this cat-ion can go

<ICE-SIN:S1B-005#39:1:A>
The first would be the usual elimination of H plus This will give
you the substitution product alright uh the cost of react for thiophen and
pyrrole this is the normal course of reaction alright the normal course but
you find that there's an alternative process which is reaction with C-H-2 the
nucleophile

<ICE-SIN:S1B-005#40:1:A>
So the H does not get lost right this is the alternative
alternative pathway

<ICE-SIN:S1B-005#41:1:A>
Now which of these paths or rather the choice of uhm which pathway
would be followed is dependent upon the activation energies of each step
depends on the relative activation energies of each step alright for this it
would be the activation energy for the loss of proton alright and for this it
would be the activation energy for the reaction with acetate

<ICE-SIN:S1B-005#42:1:A>
Now if the compound the resulting compound has got good aromatic
character in it the activation energy for the protonation would also be low
alright would be low

<ICE-SIN:S1B-005#43:1:A>
If there is aromatic character well developed in the final product
then the activation energy for loss of proton would be small alright

<ICE-SIN:S1B-005#44:1:A>
But in the case of furan since aromatic character is poorly
developed this is of low aromaticity

<ICE-SIN:S1B-005#45:1:A>
The deprotonation energy would be higher than as compared to the
deprotonation energy for the corresponding thiophen or pyrrole derivative
alright

<ICE-SIN:S1B-005#46:1:A>
So this pathway becomes an attractive alternative alright so that
because of it the reaction is directed along this course rather than above

<ICE-SIN:S1B-005#47:1:A>
But for the rest you find that if this is S alright or if it is N-H
alright thiophen or pyrrole actually these two alternatives also exist that
means it can go like that or by this way

<ICE-SIN:S1B-005#48:1:A>
But you find that this pathway hardly takes place at all because
the activation energy for loss of proton is very small and why is it small

<ICE-SIN:S1B-005#49:1:A>
It's because aromatic character is well developed in the final
product alright so it never even looks at this pathway it is directed along
this direction in this direction

<ICE-SIN:S1B-005#50:1:A>
So because of this ah for furan you do not have a straightforward
substitution alright of H like N-O-2 but there is an addition by the acetate
and ion to give rise to the two five adduct alright which is not stable so
you do get back the product that uh one sets out to obtain the two nitrofuran
by treatment of heat alright or uh by heat treatment or treatment with
pyridine alright that will eliminate the acetate and give rise to the product
okay

<ICE-SIN:S1B-005#51:1:A>
Right so that's for the nitration of furan

<ICE-SIN:S1B-005#52:1:A>
Now there could be other reagents used in place of acetyl nitrate
uh reagents which contain a nitronium cat-ion and which are also weakly
acidic

<ICE-SIN:S1B-005#53:1:A>
One example is nitronium etrafluoroborate this alright nitronium
tetrafluoroborate

<ICE-SIN:S1B-005#54:1:A>
Now when nitration is carried out using this particular reagent
there is no adduct formed

<ICE-SIN:S1B-005#55:1:A>
That means that it gives rise to a straightforward addition

<ICE-SIN:S1B-005#56:1:A>
You get this immediately alright and you may wonder what happen to
the BF4 minus why is it it doesn't add on to the positive centre to the ring

<ICE-SIN:S1B-005#57:1:A>
The reason is that the BF4 minus is not a nucleophille alright it
is not a nucleophile

<ICE-SIN:S1B-005#58:1:A>
If you look at it carefully you will see that its valence is
already saturated alright

<ICE-SIN:S1B-005#59:1:A>
The boron atom cannot form an additional bond so it cannot it will
not react with the current the positively charged carbon because its valence
is already satisfied is completely satisfied alright

<ICE-SIN:S1B-005#60:1:A>
So you find that when uh nitration is carried out using nitronium
tetrafluoroborate you won't have this form alright you'll have the addition
of the ni the nitronium cat-ion and then this will not take place

<ICE-SIN:S1B-005#61:1:A>
The elimination of H will then occur and the nitrofuran is obtained
alright

<ICE-SIN:S1B-005#62:1:A>
So that is uh so must watch out you must watch out for the type of
reagent that is used alright for the reaction

<ICE-SIN:S1B-005#63:1:A>
Now another example of an addition reaction of furan is the
bromination is uh the bromination reaction

<ICE-SIN:S1B-005#64:1:A>
Now bromination uhm is usually not a very useful electrophilic
substitution reaction because it tends to give rise to polyhalogenated
compounds right

<ICE-SIN:S1B-005#65:1:A>
The halogen enters at more than uh one position so it's uh unless
you are looking for a multi-substituted product

<ICE-SIN:S1B-005#66:1:A>
But if you want to have a monosubstituted product uhm in order for
the reaction to be useful it must be conducted at low temperatures right low
temperatures

<ICE-SIN:S1B-005#67:1:A>
Now this is an example the bromination of furan there's a bromonium
electrophile the bromonium cat-ion which is the electrophile the reaction is
carried out in the solvent methadol and at minus ten degrees centigrade

<ICE-SIN:S1B-005#68:1:A>
Now not uhm the products formed well not a-s a single product is
not formed from this reaction alright you find that there are three products
produced

<ICE-SIN:S1B-005#69:1:A>
This is the expected product of electrophilic substitution alright

<ICE-SIN:S1B-005#70:1:A>
Now how did this come about

<ICE-SIN:S1B-005#71:1:A>
By the following mechanism the same as the above alright there is a
dis delocalisation of the positive charge

<ICE-SIN:S1B-005#72:1:A>
There's methocide and ion which is the nucleophile comes from the
solvent methanol alright

<ICE-SIN:S1B-005#73:1:A>
So the methadol will produce the methocide and ion which will act
as a nucleophile and attack the ring alright

<ICE-SIN:S1B-005#74:1:A>
So you'll find that that is how the first product is uh formed and
the second the third product that is shown uh it is produced by the
displacement of B-R minus by C-H-3-O minus by the methocide and ion alright
loss of P-R minus

<ICE-SIN:S1B-005#75:1:A>
The halogens are good leaving groups so it is displaced and then
you have it alright a diene methocine adduct alright

<ICE-SIN:S1B-005#76:1:A>
So you find that uhm the hydrogen atoms here are quite resistant
alright to displacement because they are not so uh they are not as good leave
they are not <unclear> word </unclear> leaving groups as compared to bromine
alright

<ICE-SIN:S1B-005#77:1:A>
So uh these products are imitative of an addition reaction taking
place in furan right

<ICE-SIN:S1B-005#78:1:A>
Now the last example of an addition reaction is that of a
cycloaddition process and the name of this reaction is called is the
DielsAlder Reaction

<ICE-SIN:S1B-005#79:1:A>
Now the Diels-Alder Reaction refers to addition reactions of dienes
alright

<ICE-SIN:S1B-005#80:1:A>
You have a diene here

<ICE-SIN:S1B-005#81:1:A>
Now dienes will react with certain reagents uhm which are called
dienophile

<ICE-SIN:S1B-005#82:1:A>
Actually the name is not very doesn't convey to you very much
information because the dienophile is just a compound that likes a diene
alright dienophile alright like hydrophilic right that uh P-H-I-L-E indicates
it likes a diene

<ICE-SIN:S1B-005#83:1:A>
So uhm a number various types of reagents can uhm act in this
capacity as dienophile

<ICE-SIN:S1B-005#84:1:A>
A common example a good example is maleic anhydride alright

<ICE-SIN:S1B-005#85:1:A>
So when you have diene and maleic anhydride addition takes place to
give rise to an adduct the product is just called an adduct or a Diels-Alder
Al a Diels-Alder adduct alright

<ICE-SIN:S1B-005#86:1:A>
Now if you look at it carefully you will see that this portion
represents the original diene right

<ICE-SIN:S1B-005#87:1:A>
This portion is the original diene

<ICE-SIN:S1B-005#88:1:A>
Addition has taking has taken place evolving the double bond right

<ICE-SIN:S1B-005#89:1:A>
The double bond of maleic anhydride has disappeared alright so you
find these are the new bonds that are created alright

<ICE-SIN:S1B-005#90:1:A>
Since addition occurs the two double bonds of diene cannot no long
can no longer exist

<ICE-SIN:S1B-005#91:1:A>
It is now reduced to one and this is the remaining double bond
alright

<ICE-SIN:S1B-005#92:1:A>
So can you see this is the original diene and this is maleic
anhydride component alright with the double bond uhm saturated

<ICE-SIN:S1B-005#93:1:A>
Now furan has been noted to act like a diene it can react with
maleic anhydride so you find that the same thing addition across the double
bond of uh maleic anhydride produces an adduct

<ICE-SIN:S1B-005#94:1:A>
Now there are two confirmations of this adduct one an exo and the
other one endo alright <X>

<ICE-SIN:S1B-005#X95:1:A>
Exo is when the well the furan ring or what remains of it is
orientated at a different plane from the maleic anhydride alright So these
dash lines indicates that it's going down below the plane and the bold lines
it is above the plane so that is endo alright The endo product is formed more
rapidly It is a kinetic but it is not the most stable Subsequent
rearrangement will take place to give rise to the exo adduct Note the
orientation of these two wings alright Now at the same direction this one is
the thermodynamic product alright So this is an example Have you do you
remember examples of uh reactions under thermodynamic and kinetic control Uuh
one that I mention some time ago the sulfunation of kuinonine alright You
find that that is also under kinetic and thermodynamic control alright So uhm
the cycloaddition alright which is an indication that furan has diene-like
character alright Uh another thing that one could also add to the list of uhm
properties you know like uh furan indicating its diene-like properties It's
the electrophilic substitution of furan uh in particular the orientation of
the incoming electrophile alright Do you remember that part of it Alright you
had furan alright and you find that you have a substituent and I mention that
uh for all the other hetrocycles where the electrophile enters will depend on
what this X is whether it's electron donating or electron withdrawing right
Does that do you remember that But you find that in the case of furan it
doesn't matter what X is the two X alright at the two position it can be
electron donating or electron withdrawing but the electrophile is always
directed to the other kerminal carbon alright position five Alright and the
reason why this is uh so well it is a reflection of its diene-like character
alright I talk about the stabilisation of the carbonium ions and so forth
alright Supposing it goes here you find that there is limited stabilisation
of the charge of the positive charge If it goes into this direction you find
that it's more the localisation of charge alright So uh this is one point to
take note of right can add can be added to the list alright of uhm uh
chemical evidence of the low aromatic character of furan Right now so having
done with uh electrophilic substitution reactions and addition reactions we
will now move on to nucleophilic reactions </X> </I>
