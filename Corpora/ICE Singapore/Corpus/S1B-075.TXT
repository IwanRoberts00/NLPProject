<I>

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-075#1:1:A>
Okay this this one is the living assurance policy and uhm
what I will advice is that you top up thirty-five to uh fifty thousand

<ICE-SIN:S1B-075#2:1:A>
Alright the first column show you the total premium you pay over the year

<ICE-SIN:S1B-075#3:1:A>
Uh second column is the cash value alright

<ICE-SIN:S1B-075#4:1:A>
Cash value means that anytime you want to terminate your policy you can take 
back the cash

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-075#5:1:B>
Money you can get back

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-075#6:1:A>
Ya

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-075#7:1:B>
You terminate the policy

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-075#8:1:A>
Ya if you terminate the policy this is the amount of money you can get back 
alright

<ICE-SIN:S1B-075#9:1:A>
Uh death benefit of course uhm it means the twenty-six illnesses uh it's 
covering as well as in time of death or total and permanent disability

<ICE-SIN:S1B-075#10:1:A>
Then you are quite clear about the type of policy we're having right

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-075#11:1:B>
Paid up I forget

<ICE-SIN:S1B-075#12:1:B>
Paid up is the one uh okay let's say say for example number ten year

<ICE-SIN:S1B-075#13:1:B>
Okay I I stop payment or the premium and this and I let the policy
goes on so this is the uh uh coverage isn't it

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-075#14:1:A>
Okay paid up means that okay at any time uh any one year if you want
to stop paying alright if you get that in cash it's going to be
very much less than what you're going to get alright

<ICE-SIN:S1B-075#15:1:A>
So if you opt for pay up means that you know

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-075#16:1:B>
The policy will still run lah

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-075#17:1:A>
It will still down anytime down the years let's say ten years later

<ICE-SIN:S1B-075#18:1:A>
If you opt for a pay up at tenth time even is uh twenty years down
the road it will still pay you that particular value

<ICE-SIN:S1B-075#19:1:A>
Ya for example if let's say at the tenth year you opt for pay up
which is eleven thousand so another ten years down the road okay
you will only they will only eleven thousand if something happen to you

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-075#20:1:B>
If something happen

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-075#21:1:A>
Ya I mean of course here it means uhm it means in terms of the twenty-six 
sicknesses or in time or death and total and disability

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-075#22:1:B>
Four O six

<ICE-SIN:S1B-075#23:1:B>
Such a small policy

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-075#24:1:A>
That's because uhm uhm uh top it up for your last twenty-five thousand

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-075#25:1:B>
I didn't know that last time I bought so such a small policy

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-075#26:1:A>
Oh yes I am trying to ask you to buy a bigger policy you say no no no

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-075#27:1:B>
Such a small policy fifteen thousand

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-075#28:1:A>
So should I keep increase to what fifty thousand

<ICE-SIN:S1B-075#29:1:A>
Fifty thousand are you sure

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-075#30:1:B>
But I don't want to

<ICE-SIN:S1B-075#31:1:B>
I I don't want to spend so much money

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-075#32:1:A>
Alright normally for uhm for any insurance policy what
you should consider is that uhm you can either pay uh
about fifteen per cent of your annual salary alright

<ICE-SIN:S1B-075#33:1:A>
The total premium should be about fifteen per cent of your annual salary

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-075#34:1:B>
That is a lot isn't it

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-075#35:1:A>
Uhm

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-075#36:1:B>
Alamak fifteen is a lot of money

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-075#37:1:A>
Well it's uh money from the left hand pocket to the right hand pocket

<ICE-SIN:S1B-075#38:1:A>
You still get back every cent eventually

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-075#39:1:B>
It's a lot of money

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-075#40:1:A>
And I say you you still get back every cent eventually alright

<ICE-SIN:S1B-075#41:1:A>
So as I said it's either fifteen per cent of your annual salary or
uhm it's uh six times your annual salary the total amount you should return

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-075#42:1:B>
Six times

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-075#43:1:A>
Six to seven times your annual salary depending on the age

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-075#44:1:B>
Six times

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-075#45:1:A>
Ya

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-075#46:1:B>
It's also a lot

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-075#47:1:A>
Then you are under insured

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-075#48:1:B>
I have how much

<ICE-SIN:S1B-075#49:1:B>
Let's see how much

<ICE-SIN:S1B-075#50:1:B>
I have maybe perhaps talking about six times
I have maybe only uh how much am I insured

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-075#51:1:A>
How much are you insured

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-075#52:1:B>
Less than two hundred thousand

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-075#53:1:A>
No uh no

<ICE-SIN:S1B-075#54:1:A>
Okay when I talk about six seven time your annual salary
alright it also cover your term policy alright

<ICE-SIN:S1B-075#55:1:A>
It will cover uhm the amount which your company is buying for you

<ICE-SIN:S1B-075#56:1:A>
It doesn't means that everything is out of your pocket okay and
uh normally as a person grow older the amount uhm insured over
the annual salary can be less

<ICE-SIN:S1B-075#57:1:A>
For example if you are in your forties then the amount which
can be five times your annual salary

<ICE-SIN:S1B-075#58:1:A>
Because by then your income would have increased so it cannot
be six seven times in at that

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-075#59:1:B>
Fifteen thousand for four hundred dollars

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-075#60:1:A>
This is very little right

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-075#61:1:B>
Ya expensive

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-075#62:1:A>
No it's not

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-075#63:1:B>
Kim Wan one how much uh I forgot four hundred plus also

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-075#64:1:A>
Ya but Kim Wan age is uhm

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-075#65:1:B>
That one is without loading

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-075#66:1:A>
Uh that is without loading but of course I'm giving her
the standard right but actually when it comes back to us I think probably

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-075#67:1:B>
Does she need to go through another policy uh uh uh medical check up

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-075#68:1:A>
I doubt so because it's only in the matter of one year

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-075#69:1:B>
So not necessary ya

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-075#70:1:A>
But as I say I can't say anything in this present moment

<ICE-SIN:S1B-075#71:1:A>
If the underwriter need her to go for a medical check check-up
she has to also alright

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-075#72:1:B>
Why underwriter so cautious

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-075#73:1:A>
Well uhm the risk is there you see and uh that type of
medication which she is taking is still basically the
same so I'm not very sure whether they still need
uhm to uh for her to go for another check-up

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-075#74:1:B>
Your this uh so-called concession what or offer period
or concession rate until end of this year

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-075#75:1:A>
It's just no it's up to thirtieth of November but of course
uh don't wait until the last minute because uh it may be
some complication who knows

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-075#76:1:B>
You think something like Telecoms rush

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-075#77:1:A>
Ya ya ya you'd be surprised you know

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-075#78:1:B>
No lah what Telecoms rush

<ICE-SIN:S1B-075#79:1:B>
You won't have another Telecoms rush

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-075#80:1:A>
No what I mean of course not

<ICE-SIN:S1B-075#81:1:A>
But what I'm trying to say is that okay give us two weeks
you know because maybe you need a medical check-up you know

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-075#82:1:B>
I need a medical check-up

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-075#83:1:A>
Don't be too sure don't be too sure

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-075#84:1:B>
I am very sure I am very sure

<ICE-SIN:S1B-075#85:1:B>
Actually not bad uh medical check-up free medical check-up

<ICE-SIN:S1B-075#86:1:B>
I want to go for medical check-up

<ICE-SIN:S1B-075#87:1:B>
I talked about it for years no action

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-075#88:1:A>
So you want a free medical check-up

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-075#89:1:B>
Free right

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-075#90:1:A>
Ya but

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-075#91:1:B>
Can refer one right

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-075#92:1:A>
But they only charge you on your blood sorry on your
blood and urine that's right

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-075#93:1:B>
Not I went for blood test cholesterol

<ICE-SIN:S1B-075#94:1:B>
Don't know what it's because of the you know the I want
to go on the acu test the acu test so you need a blood test

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-075#95:1:A>
So coming back to this policy maybe I should refresh your memory later

<ICE-SIN:S1B-075#96:1:A>
Alright uh for example let's look at uhm fifty-five if
you decide to stop paying and if something happen uh ten
years down the road okay they're still be paying you the new uhm

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-075#97:1:B>
Aye how come

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-075#98:1:A>
Benefit minus the ten years without uh minus the ten years premium

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-075#99:1:B>
It's it's different from paying up uh

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-075#100:1:A>
It's different ya

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-075#101:1:B>
That must be after paying back

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-075#102:1:A>
Normally people will opt for it only after a few years because
it make no sense you see

<ICE-SIN:S1B-075#103:1:A>
For example if if if you pay for about fifteen years or so this
policy can actually run until you're in eighties and I think
it's worth while considering because you are only covered medically until

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-075#104:1:B>
Fifty-five until sixty

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-075#105:1:A>
Fifty-five or sixty after that you're not cover uhm by any medical insurance

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-075#106:1:B>
This one is sixty uh

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-075#107:1:A>
No those who are

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-075#108:1:B>
Sixty-five

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-075#109:1:A>
No no no

<ICE-SIN:S1B-075#110:1:A>
I show the figure fifty-five sixty sixty-five because this
is the time when people stop paying you see because when you
retire as long as this policy you don't terminate it will continue you know

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-075#111:1:B>
So

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-075#112:1:A>
up to your eighties even in your nineties

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-075#113:1:B>
But you it only covers up to sixty-five what or something

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-075#114:1:A>
No no no no

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-075#115:1:B>
Fifty-five something like that isn't it

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-075#116:1:A>
You're wrong

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-075#117:1:B>
No

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-075#118:1:A>
No you're wrong

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-075#119:1:B>
No no no

<ICE-SIN:S1B-075#120:1:B>
I thought the policy was was was uh

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-075#121:1:A>
Okay this policy technically alright

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-075#122:1:B>
Technically

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-075#123:1:A>
Alright will be you have to pay up to eight well you have to pay up to 
eighty-seven years

<ICE-SIN:S1B-075#124:1:A>
Alright that means if you continue paying when the person is eighty-eight 
alright that's when the policy become free

<ICE-SIN:S1B-075#125:1:A>
But normally people won't pay for such a long period so normally
people pay for fifteen years or they pay until they are fifty-five
sixty or sixty-five then you stop paying alright

<ICE-SIN:S1B-075#126:1:A>
And the policy will be able to run on so let's say if you stop paying at 
fifty-five or sixty right if something happen to you at seventy years
old they will still pay you

<ICE-SIN:S1B-075#127:1:A>
So it is actually uhm quite sometimes It's after uh

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-075#128:1:B>
All along I thought this policy were only cover up to what sixty-five
years old or fifty-five years old or something like that

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-075#129:1:A>
No no

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-075#130:1:B>
It used to be like that isn't it

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-075#131:1:A>
It was never use to be like that

<ICE-SIN:S1B-075#132:1:A>
I think you got it wrong right from the start

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-075#133:1:B>
No I thought so

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-075#134:1:A>
No

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-075#135:1:B>
I remember it it was

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-075#136:1:A>
No as I was explaining for example okay uhm if you stop paying at fifty-five 
okay the coverage is forty-three right

<ICE-SIN:S1B-075#137:1:A>
Now at sixty-five if something happen to you okay they will pay you
sixty-nine minus the ten year premium plus interest

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-075#138:1:B>
Uhm

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-075#139:1:A>
So isn't that very attractive

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-075#140:1:B>
What so attracting

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-075#141:1:A>
What what do you mean by not so attractive because you already stop paying 
they're giving you the new coverage minus the ten year premium plus uh

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-075#142:1:B>
It's attractive if it's free

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-075#143:1:A>
And if it's attractive is free nothing is for free

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-075#144:1:B>
Uhm nothing is for free

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-075#145:1:A>
Ya

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-075#146:1:B>
To break-even so it takes so long to break-even fifteen years

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-075#147:1:A>
Uhm break-even is about uh fourteen fifteen years

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-075#148:1:B>
Takes so long

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-075#149:1:A>
Uhm whether it's long or short it's relative

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-075#150:1:B>
Actually I can go and buy a what and tick

<ICE-SIN:S1B-075#151:1:B>
Or this one cannot be as a rider right you told me before I bought

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-075#152:1:A>
It can be as a rider but a rider will stop at sixty in that sense
you are right

<ICE-SIN:S1B-075#153:1:A>
You buy a rider you will stop covering you at sixty and for a
rider there is no bonus included alright that means if something
happens to you

<ICE-SIN:S1B-075#154:1:A>
Let's say if you buy a thirty thousand rider attach to a policy

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-075#155:1:B>
It's cheaper right

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-075#156:1:A>
It's much cheaper but if let's say nothing happen you won't get
a single cent and if something happen you'll only get

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-075#157:1:B>
But the main policy the main policy uh it's income generally

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-075#158:1:A>
Ya the basic policy there is bonus so as you see the figure
actually increase

<ICE-SIN:S1B-075#159:1:A>
For example you look at the cash value uh on return here is a
very small amount but as you go along you know the amount increase

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-075#160:1:B>
Is it cheaper if I go in that way I I do it that way

<ICE-SIN:S1B-075#161:1:B>
That I buy another like some other policy then I take this as a rider

<ICE-SIN:S1B-075#162:1:B>
Is it more more

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-075#163:1:A>
I think it's not advisable

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-075#164:1:B>
Why

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-075#165:1:A>
Because this policy

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-075#166:1:B>
How come I don't have a convertible rider

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-075#167:1:A>
Because you never buy a rider

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-075#168:1:B>
But does that really matter

<ICE-SIN:S1B-075#169:1:B>
You see it's still at the same rate whether I I get the rider or not

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-075#170:1:A>
Ya but presumably let's say if you are medically unfit right now
if you have a rider then the company have not right to reject you

<ICE-SIN:S1B-075#171:1:A>
You get what I'm trying to say

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-075#172:1:B>
Ah ha

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-075#173:1:A>
Alright so the other about this policy is that now if you take it
as a rider now this policy or rather the rider will stop paying
when you are sixty

<ICE-SIN:S1B-075#174:1:A>
And the two particular disease which you have Alzheimer and
Parkinson and that basically attack a person in their old age

<ICE-SIN:S1B-075#175:1:A>
And a lot of this problem actually you know uh appears when
the person is old and it doesn't make sense you know that
you buy this policy to protect you right now but when it come
to your old age there's nothing to protect you </I>
