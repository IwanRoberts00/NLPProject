<ICE-SIN:W2A-022#5:1>
Sensory neurones are nerve-cells whose fibres connect with receptors,
transmitting impulses started by receptors to central nervous system ( Hopper
and Hart 1985).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-022#6:1>
In vertebrates, the cell body of such a neurone is attached to its
nerve-fibres at a point along its course situated in the dorsal root ganglion
( DRG).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-022#7:1>
The DRG is a collection of sensory neurones and glial cells.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-022#8:1>
Both cell types are derivatives of the neural crest cells ( Le Douarin
1982).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-022#9:1>
In a typical vertebrate, each DRG is located opposite the dorsal horn
of the spinal cord continuous with the dorsal root.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-022#10:1>
Textbook illustrations usually show the DRG being anatomically
separated from the motor components of the peripheral nervous system.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-022#11:1>
This generalization may be true for most vertebrates, including
mammals, avians, amphibians and elasmobranchs.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-022#12:1>
However, the same may not be applicable to teleosts since there is
hardly any systematic study on the anatomy of teleostean DRG.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-022#13:1>
Our recent study in one bony fish, the tilapia ( Oreochromis
mossambicus), revealed that its DRG is fused with the motor root, thus making
it a mixed organ instead of a purely sensory one ( Laudel and Lim 1993).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-022#14:1>
This prompted us to look at more fishes and started our comparative
study on the teleostean DRG.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-022#15:1>
Some of the recent findings from several teleosts are described in
this paper.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-022#16:1>
<h> MATERIALS AND METHHODS </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-022#17:1>
The fishes studied were tilapia ( Oreochromis mossambicus), guppy (
Poecilia reticulata), zebrafish ( Brachydanio rerio), Japanese medaka (
Oryzias latipes), and swordtail ( Xiphomhorus helleri).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-022#18:1>
They were killed by chilling in ice and then fixed in 4%
paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline ( pH 7.4) at 4C for at least 12
hours.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-022#19:1>
A lipophilic fluorescent dye with the formula:
1,1'dioctadecyl-3,3,3',3'-tetramethyl-indocarbocyanine perchlorate ( DiI,
Molecular Probes) was used to label the peripheral nerves and DRG in the
specimens.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-022#20:1>
The procedures have been described in Laudel and Lim ( 1993) and Lim
et al.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-022#21:1>
( 1993).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-022#22:1>
Briefly it involved removing the muscles flanking the vertebral
column and placing DiI crystals at where the peripheral nerves traversed.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-022#23:1>
Due to the lipophilic property of the dye, it would spread along the
nerves and thus staining the cells in the DRG.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-022#24:1>
The dye was allowed to spread over a few days when the specimens were
left in the fixative at 37@C.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-022#25:1>
The specimens were then scanned whole-mounted under the confocal
laser scanning microscope ( CLSM, BioRad MRC) using the 488nm ( blue) or 514
nm ( green) excitation.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-022#26:1>
The confocal images were captured on film with the Polaroid
freeze-frame recorder.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-022#27:1>
<h> RESULTS AND DISCUSSION </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-022#28:1>
The branching pattern of the major spinal nerves in all the 5 fishes
studied follows a general layout.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-022#29:1>
Each DRG gives rise to a dorsal, a medial, and a ventral sensory
ramus, respectively.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-022#30:1>
The ventral root, on the other hand, gives rise to a dorsal and a
ventral motor branch.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-022#31:1>
The ventral motor ramus usually fuses with the ventral sensory ramus,
and together they course towards the ventral musculatures as a mixed nerve.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-022#32:1>
The dorsal motor ramus travels caudally and joins the dorsal sensory
ramus of the caudal segment.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-022#33:1>
Although we did not study the minor branches of these peripheral
nerves, an earlier study on the goldfish ( Fetcho 1986) suggests that the
detailed branching patterns could be species specific.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-022#34:1>
The motor nerves branching pattern has been described in the
zebrafish by Westerfield et al.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-022#35:1>
( 1986) and it differs in details compared to the goldfish
descriptions.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-022#36:1>
The DRG in these 2 species were, however, not documented.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-022#37:1>
The DRG in the 5 species described here show interesting variations
among them ( Figs.l to 5).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-022#38:1>
In terms of shape, the DRG in tilapia, guppy, medaka and swordtail
have a roundish to a pear-shaped appearance when view laterally; whereas the
zebrafish DRG tends to be elongated or sausage-shaped.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-022#39:1>
In terms of relative position to the spinal cord, the zebrafish again
differs from the other 4.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-022#40:1>
It is lateral to the spinal cord while in the other 4 species, the
DRG occupies a ventral position.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-022#41:1>
Ventral located DRG has also been recorded in the pike, Esox lucius (
Harder 1975) and the striped bass ( Groman 1982 ) .

<ICE-SIN:W2A-022#42:1>
However, Yokote ( 1982) found in the rainbow trout dorso-laterally
situated DRG.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-022#43:1>
The differences in shape and position of the fish DRG could be due to
species differences in their neural crest cells migration and condensation
pattern during development.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-022#44:1>
The dorsal root leading from the DRG to the spinal cord also shows
variations among the 5 species studied here.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-022#45:1>
The dorsal root in the zebrafish is not very distinct when compared
to the other 4.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-022#46:1>
The short and ill defined dorrsal root enters the spinal cord from
the elongated, laterally situated DRG at an angle almost perpendicular to
dorso-ventral orientation of the DRG.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-022#47:1>
Contrary to this is the dorsal root seen in the medaka.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-022#48:1>
In this fish, dorsal root tends to flatten out and becomes broaden
morphology.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-022#49:1>
It leaves the ventrally situated DRG at oblique angle rostrally
towards the dorsal horn.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-022#50:1>
The dorsal roots in tilapia, guppy and swordtail are also distinct
structures.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-022#51:1>
Each dorsal root appears as a tubelike connection between the DRG and
the dorsal horn.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-022#52:1>
In terms of seqmental origin, the dorsal and ventral roots in guppy,
swordtail and zebrafish are found to connect the spinal cord at the same
segmental level as the vertebra that encases them.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-022#53:1>
However, the dorsal root entrance to the spinal cord and the spinal
cord exit of the motor root in tilapia and medaka are located one segment
rostral to the vertebra that encases them.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-022#54:1>
This could be due to a pronounced relative shift of the muscle /
skeletal segment to the spinal segment during growth ( cf relative shift of
somites to spinal cord seen in Xenopus laevis tadpole tail, Nordlander 1984).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-022#55:1>
The DRG in tilapia has been shown to contain both sensory neurones
and motor fibres ( Laudel and Lim, in press).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-022#56:1>
A similar picture is found in the DRG of the swordtail.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-022#57:1>
A careful analysis of the DRG ontogeny in the tilapia revealed that
the mixed nature is due to the accumulation of DRG precursor cells ( i.e.,
neural crest cells) around the ventral root during development.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-022#58:1>
Prior to hatching, the DRG and the ventral root in the tilapia embryo
are clearly separate entities ( Laudel and Lim, in press).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-022#59:1>
The development of DRG in the swordtail is probably similar to the
process observed in tilapia.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-022#60:1>
Sadaghiani and Vielkind ( 1990) used HNK-1 antibody to trace the
migration of neural crest cells in swordtail embryos and noted that the HNK-1
stained primodia of the DRG were also attached to the ventral part of the
neural tube.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-022#61:1>
Although these authors did not state whether the crest cells
accumulate around the ventral motor root, our study suggests that they do.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-022#62:1>
The DRG in guppy, zebrafish and medaka are purely sensory in their
composition.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-022#63:1>
However, the DRG in guppy sometimes shows a tendency towards the
situation seen in tilapia and swordtail.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-022#64:1>
Under the CLSM the guppy DRG sometimes appears as spreading over the
dorsal ramus of the motor root, thus giving the impression of the motor
nerves growing through the DRG.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-022#65:1>
The differences in the DRG arrangement in relation to the motor root
could be due to subtle differences in the neural crest ontogeny among the
various teleosts.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-022#66:1>
It can be concluded from this study that not all species of teleosts
exhibit similar DRG structure.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-022#67:1>
Within the vast species diversity present in teleosts ( about 23,000
species according to Northcutt and Davis 1983), this finding is not
surprising.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-022#68:1>
However, in the course of reviewing literature, it was found that
there was a dearth in accurate descriptions of the gross anatomy of the
teleostean spinal nerves, especially the DRG.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-022#69:1>
Many textbooks tend to leave out the teleosts in their comparative
discussions between classes of vertebrates ( eg see Vines and Rees 1972;
Hildebrand 1988).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-022#70:1>
This study helps to fill in the gap.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-022#71:1>
Through this study we also propose that the generalization of fish
nervous structure presented in textbooks of comparative anatomy ( eg Kent
1987), or even in atlases of fish histology ( eg Hibiya 1982) should not be
taken too seriously. </I>

<h> HORMONES AND THE CONTROL OF GESTATION AND PARTUITION IN THE GUPPY
( POECILIA RETICULATA) </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-022#73:2>
Department of Zoology, National University of Singapore,

<ICE-SIN:W2A-022#74:2>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-022#75:2>
The guppy is a life-bearer.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-022#76:2>
The male transfers sperms in bundles into the ovary of the female
where they may be stored for up to 7 to 8 mon in a " seminal receptacle".

<ICE-SIN:W2A-022#77:2>
Unlike the oviparous teleosts, the mature oocytes are fertilized
intrafollicularly, ie while they are still within the follicles.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-022#78:2>
Fertilization occurs between 5 and 7 days postpartum.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-022#79:2>
This is followed by a prolonged intra-follicular gestation of about
21 d, at the end of which the fully developed embryos are ovulated just prior
to parturition.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-022#80:2>
The mean interbrood interval is 28 d.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-022#81:2>
Very little is known about the hormonal control of gestation and
parturition in teleosts.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-022#82:2>
In an attempt to unravel the role of steroid hormones in these
processes, we have examined the serum profile of steroids at various stages
of the reproductive cycle; the synthesis of steroid metabolites from
radioactive precursors; and, the effects of specific steroids on ovulation
and/or parturition in vivo.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-022#83:2>
The levels of estradiol-17g, testosterone, cortisol,17
q-hydroxyproqesterone, 171-20-dihydroxy-4-pregnen-3-one ( 17,20B-P) and
progesterone were measured simultaneously in microlitre-volumes of serum at
different stages of gestation.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-022#84:2>
A highly specific, sensitive, precise, accurate procedure involving
high-performance liquid chromatography and radioimmunoassay was developed for
this purpose ( Venkatesh et al 1989).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-022#85:2>
Levels of estradic and testosterone increased during vitellogenic
growth of oocytes, and declined during late gestation to reach
prefertilization levels at periparturition.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-022#86:2>
Cortisol levels decreased significantly during fertilization followed
by an increase during gestation and a sharp decline again at periparturition.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-022#87:2>
The level of 17q hydroxyprogesterone was significantly lower at
periparturition than at other stages, while that of 20B-P was significantly
higher at periparturition than in late gestation.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-022#88:2>
There was no significant change in the levels of progesterone at all
stages of gestation suggesting that, unlike mammals, progesterone may nobe
involved in maintaining gestation in this fish.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-022#89:2>
Changes in the levels of estradiol-17B and testosterone seem to be
related to oocyte growth rather than gestation.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-022#90:2>
The elevated levels of estradiol-17B at term may also facilitate
parturition, in addition to its stimulation of vitellogenesis during oocyte
growth.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-022#91:2>
On the basis of the present results, none of the steroids measured
are involved in maintaining gestation in the guppy ( Venkatesh et al - l990).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-022#92:2>
It is possible that such results reflect one major limitation of the
procedure - overlooking the role of a hiterto unknown steroid whose level was
not measured.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-022#93:2>
We therefore examined the metabolism of various radiolabelled
precursors such as pregnenolone, progesterone, 17q hydroxyprogesterone, and
testosterone, by isolated follicles ( oocytes and embryos enclosed within the
follicle layers) and extrafollicular tissue ( EF) of the guppy.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-022#94:2>
Follicles and EF derived from ovaries at different stages of
gestation were incubated in vitro with 1 Ci of radioactive precursors at 25C.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-022#95:2>
The radioactive metabolites were extracted and separated by 5
different high performance liquid chromatography systems, and detected with
the on-line radio-activity detector.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-022#96:2>
The metabolites were further characterized by thin-layer
chromatography, microchemical reactions, and recrystallization to constant
specific activity; Venkatesh 1992a).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-022#97:2>
With 3H-pregnenolone as precursor, vitellogenic and post-
vitellogenic follicles synthesized mainly androstenedione, 17q-
hydroxyprogesterone, and the 5q reduced androgens ( 5q-androstane - 3,
17-dione, 5q-DHT).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-022#98:2>
The synthesis of these " classical" steroids were, however, switched
off during both early and late gestation.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-022#99:2>
Instead, very polar steroids and their glucuronides were synthesized.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-022#100:2>
After gestation, synthesis of the classic steroids resumed.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-022#101:2>
Metabolism of 3H-progesterone showed a similar trend.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-022#102:2>
Vitellogenic and post-vitellogenic oocytes synthesized mainly the
classical steroids mentioned earlier.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-022#103:2>
In addition, 17a,20-P was produced by the post-vitellogenic oocytes,
albeit at a low level.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-022#104:2>
Strikingly, increased synthesis of polar steroids and their
glucuronides were seen during early and late gestation.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-022#105:2>
Again, there was no synthesis of classical steroids at these stages.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-022#106:2>
Similar trends in steroid biosthesis were evident with 3H-17a -
hydroxyprogesterone.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-022#107:2>
With 3H-testosterone, vitellogenic follicles produced estradiol-17b
and testosterone glucuronide. <X>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-022#X108:2>
The postvitelloge follicles produced the 5-reduced androgens and
their respective glucuronides.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-022#X109:2>
Clearly, gestation stage follicles rapidly converted the precursors
into 5-reduced and novel polar 7-hydroxylated steroids, and their
glucuronides.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-022#X110:2>
Postpartum follicles showed very poor potential for steroid
metabolism.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-022#X111:2>
These results demonstrate distinct changes in the steroidogenic
potential of the follicles during the reproductive cycle.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-022#X112:2>
Unlike in other viviparous vertebrates, no particular steroid seems
to be involved in maintaining gestation in the guppy - all the steroid
precursors are converted into highly polar metabolites and their conjugates
during gestation, thereby facilitating their excretion.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-022#X113:2>
The EF ovarian tissue also synthesized 7-hydroxylated steroids and
their glucuronides, providing evidence for the first time that the teleost
ovarian EF is steroidoqenic.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-022#X114:2>
Having identified some of the steroids whose levels in the the
serum showed distinct changes during reproduction, the effects in vivo of
progesterone. </X> </I>
