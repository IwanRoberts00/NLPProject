<h> Unconducive and cramped work place among complaints </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2C-002#4:1>
TEACHERS at Pasir Ris Secondary seek retreat from work stress in a
lounge right in their school, a pastel-coloured, carpeted room as cosy as
home.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-002#5:1>
The mauve painted lounge, complete with dimmers, a comfortable settee,
and shelves stocked with reading material, is also equipped with a karaoke
set for the teachers.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-002#6:1>
This aspect of the school is atypical of most government schools where
teachers complain about an unconducive work environment, like poorly
ventilated and cramped work spaces.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-002#7:1>
But this is set to change.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-002#8:1>
The Education Ministry is going to ensure that adequate work space is
provided and staff rooms are air-conditioned.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-002#9:1>
In fact, other changes are in store.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-002#10:1>
The Straits Times spoke to 20 teachers in primary, secondary and
junior colleges about the impending changes and the results of a teacher
survey.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-002#11:1>
But all those interviewed refused to give their full names or
initials.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-002#12:1>
There's homework too.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-002#13:1>
The survey found that teachers work six to eight hours a day in
school.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-002#14:1>
But those who spoke to The Straits Times said more work is done at
home,up to about two hours a day.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-002#15:1>
As Mrs Li, a secondary school teacher, said: " Most days I have to
bring home books to mark because there is just no time to do that in school.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-002#16:1>
My spare time in school is spent on administrative duties like
collecting fees, marking registers, planning the curriculum, organising
school activities like Founders Day and overseeing ECA " I also have four
hours of remedial classes a week and need to make time for my pupils to
consult me about their work between lessons."

<ICE-SIN:W2C-002#17:1>
Primary and junior college teachers cited similarly long hours,
although their duties vary somewhat.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-002#18:1>
While teachers could benefit from having the ministry's promise of
more support staff to perform the clerical chores, they could also probably
benefit from time management courses.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-002#19:1>
Said Mrs Wong, who quit her job recently after over 10 years of
service: " We juggled many duties.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-002#20:1>
Some teachers worked fast and did minimal work at home while the
slower ones were forever marking books.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-002#21:1>
I did all my marking in school so I needed to prepare the curriculum
at home - - this alone took me at least five hours a week." One teacher, many
roles?

<ICE-SIN:W2C-002#22:1>
Pressure from parents and principals for teachers to play multiple
roles as educators, mentors, role-models and counsellors place great strain
on the teachers.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-002#23:1>
Said an English teacher in a primary school: " Much as I would like
to play the ideal teacher, I have other roles: as mother, wife and daughter
to my family."

<ICE-SIN:W2C-002#24:1>
Added another teacher: " Each role suffers given the demands on our
jobs." Her solution?

<ICE-SIN:W2C-002#25:1>
Define the teacher's role clearly and employ specialists, like social
workers, who can complement their work.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-002#26:1>
An option is to increase the teacher-student ratio.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-002#27:1>
Teachers also cited unrealistic expectations of principals and
parents as a main concern.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-002#28:1>
The English teacher said: " They can't expect us to turn the average
student with 50 % passes into a star performer scoring 90%.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-002#29:1>
We're educators, not miracle workers."

<ICE-SIN:W2C-002#30:1>
In service courses good, but...

<ICE-SIN:W2C-002#31:1>
While teachers are generally satisfied with the range and content of
in service courses, some are reluctant to attend them.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-002#32:1>
Some teachers find they are exhausted at the end of the day.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-002#33:1>
They may attend a course from 8 am to noon, then rush to school for
lessons from 1 p.m to 6.30 p.m Said a teacher: " We're so exhausted that
given the choice we would rather forfeit the chance to upgrade ourselves.."
On sabbaticals and no-pay leave, some teachers suggested that the ministry be
more flexible.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-002#34:1>
Said a junior college teacher: " We get burnt out.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-002#35:1>
It's difficult for us to apply for time off because we are so
understaffed." Storeroom of a work environment Teachers are glad that the MOE
intends to upgrade their cramped working quarters by installing air
conditioning and providing adequate work space in the staff rooms.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-002#36:1>
Said Mrs Paramita Bandara, principal of Pasir Ris Secondary: " We
have about 70 teachers and our staff room is so short of space that it looks
like a store room.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-002#37:1>
Obviously it was designed by non users." Closer partners in the
making Teachers welcome the steps the ministry intends to take to show that
it is interested in feedback from teachers.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-002#38:1>
Said teacher Ms L Tan: " While there's a lot of emphasis on how to
attract new teachers, the ministry should consider even more ways of
retaining those already on the job." </I>

THE STRAITS TIMES, MONDAY, MARCH 29, 1993

<ICE-SIN:W2C-002#40:2>
<h> Caution's the word for students at Aussie varsity fair </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2C-002#41:2>
They are worried about low entry requirements

<ICE-SIN:W2C-002#42:2>
By Rachel Tan

<ICE-SIN:W2C-002#43:2>
THEY may be keen on pursuing a degree, but they will not compromise
standards.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-002#44:2>
Singapore school leavers who are looking at educational opportunities
in Australia say they are worried about the low entry requirements.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-002#45:2>
At an exhibition put up by 48 Australian educational institutions
here, they ask the universities to name their brightest academics as one way
of checking whether they would be enrolling into a good university.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-002#46:2>
On their part, the Australians say that they provide enough
information for the students to make an informed choice.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-002#47:2>
The three-day exhibition, which ended yesterday, attracted about
5,000 people.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-002#48:2>
An estimated 700 people visited the exhibition within three hours of
its opening.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-002#49:2>
Most were A-level school leavers looking at prospective undergraduate
or foundation courses.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-002#50:2>
Because of the purported hard sell of the Australian education
industry here, these school-leavers were concerned that the institutions
might be using marketing hype to get fee paying students in.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-002#51:2>
They tread carefully when selecting their schools, and some come
armed with notepads filled with questions for the universities'
representatives.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-002#52:2>
Miss Kang Mei Ling, 19, who is planning to do a medical course, is
one who has done her research.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-002#53:2>
Besides the usual questions about course content and living expenses,
she also asked representatives about their recent medical breakthroughs,
their most well-known academics and the current areas of research that they
are pursuing.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-002#54:2>
" I can check it up so don't lie to me", is her attitude towards the
hard sell at the exhibition.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-002#55:2>
She intends to verify her information by checking with libraries,
professional bodies and friends who have studied in Australia.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-002#56:2>
Like her, Eugene Tan, 20, intends to make a thorough comparison of
the entry requirements for the different universities.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-002#57:2>
Said the national serviceman, who intends to pursue a humanities
course:

<ICE-SIN:W2C-002#58:2>
" I would worry if the entry standards set are too low, as there
might be a catch to the degree."

<ICE-SIN:W2C-002#59:2>
He also intends to check if potential employers will recognise the
degrees he is interested in.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-002#60:2>
The Australian Trade Commission ( Austrade), which is organising the
fair is aware that these concerns have been raised because of the perceived
hard sell by the universities.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-002#61:2>
Said a spokesman: " If the universities lower standards or give
misleading information, it would be at the risk of their reputations.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-002#62:2>
Our best marketing strategy is still word of mouth."

<ICE-SIN:W2C-002#63:2>
The trade commission told the students to visit the Australian
Education Centre for further " impartial counselling" about their schools,
and reassured applicants that the Australian government has legislation to
protect overseas students.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-002#64:2>
For example, all institutions holding courses for overseas students
have to have their curriculum and even campus facilities endorsed by the
government.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-002#65:2>
Furthermore, financial legislation ensures that government-funded
universities, secondary schools and polytechnics are in no danger of
financial collapse.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-002#66:2>
Still, caution is the keyword for many.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-002#67:2>
Said Dave Chung, 22, who is looking for a business course: " Do not
rely too much on the glossy brochures and the marketing hype.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-002#68:2>
" An informed choice can be made by knowing what you want, asking the
right questions and checking it up with alumni and other unbiased parties
like teachers and friends.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-002#69:2>


<ICE-SIN:W2C-002#70:2>
IVF programme:

<ICE-SIN:W2C-002#71:2>
Husbands need support groups as well MEN with wives in the in-vitro
fertility ( IVF) programme should join support groups to help them through
the " private hell" they go through when they fail repeatedly to conceive.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-002#72:2>
While it is acknowledged that the women suffer the physical and
emotional trauma that comes with repeated attempts and failures to become
pregnant, few people know what the men go through.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-002#73:2>
This call was made yesterday by 25 current and former patients of the
Singapore General Hospital's Centre for Assisted Reproduction ( Care) at a
celebration marking Care's fifth anniversary.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-002#74:2>
The 25 have started an informal support group at the centre.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-002#75:2>
About 50 IVF children and their families attended the celebrations.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-002#76:2>
In-vitro fertilisation occurs when a woman's egg is fertilised in a
laboratory dish and then transferred back into her womb.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-002#77:2>
More than 20O babies have been born to Care since the centre opened
in March 1988.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-002#78:2>
During the celebrations, the centre asked current and former patients
of the centre to join the support group, which will be registered within six
months and acknowledged that while women remain the group's prime focus, the
men need support, too.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-002#79:2>
Men may initially have to face the fear that they may be found to be
infertile - - which many think makes them less of a man.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-002#80:2>
Then they have to cope with the daily sperm collections, blood tests,
sex on demand, abstinence, and the long wait to see if they have succeeded.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-002#81:2>
This feeling of helplessness is intensified when the couple fails to
conceive after repeated trials.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-002#82:2>
Said Mrs Marilynn Woo, a former Care patient who now has a
one-year-old IVF baby: " My husband was very excited when I first got
pregnant.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-002#83:2>
He told everyone and bought baby clothes.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-002#84:2>
" When we lost the baby he became just as depressed as I was and even
refused to look at baby things anymore because of the fear that we might not
see the new baby through."

<ICE-SIN:W2C-002#85:2>
The trials do not end when the woman gets pregnant either.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-002#86:2>
While all the attention is focussed on her, the husband is largely
forgotten, although the pregnancy takes an emotional toll on him as well.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-002#87:2>
Said one husband, who declined to be named: " It was a trying time as
she was suffering from severe mood swings because of the hormone injections
needed to keep her womb from spontaneously aborting the baby.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-002#88:2>
" This was something I had to try hard to understand, and it helped
to meet other husbands with problems like mine to whom I could voice my
anxieties."

<ICE-SIN:W2C-002#89:2>
Said Mr Tom Werry, 48, father of two IVF boys: " As a father who has
gone through the programme, I could share my experiences so that anyone going
through it can feel more comfortable and less alone."

<ICE-SIN:W2C-002#90:2>
Once the support group is registered, it aims to provide moral
support for Care patients as well as administrative support for seminars and
talks for couples who have difficulty conceiving.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-002#91:2>
It hopes that this will increase awareness and encourage couples to
come forward and seek help for their fertility problems.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-002#92:2>
Yesterday's celebrations also featured talks by Professor Maureen
Tsakok, Head of Singapore General Hospital's Care and the Obstetrics and
Gynaecology Department, and Dr Ho Lai Yun, the head of the Department of
Neonatology.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-002#93:2>
Prof Tsakok spoke about the Care programme and the progress it has
made over the last five years.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-002#94:2>
About 33 % of the couples in SGH's IVF programme have successfully
had babies, compared with the national figure of 14.8 % culled from the
combined success rate for all the six fertility centres - - Kandang Kerbau
Hospital, SGH, National University Hospital, Mount Elizabeth Hospital,
Thomson Medical Centre and Gleneagles Hospital.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-002#95:2>
Dr Ho revealed that about 1.5 % of babies born each year in Singapore
are IVF babies.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-002#96:2>
He added that while their mothers faced high-risk pregnancies - -
with premature babies that might initially need intensive neonatal care - -
the babies they had " are not different from any non IVF baby and should thus
be treated the same way."

<ICE-SIN:W2C-002#97:2>
There is no reason to show that IVF babies do worse than non IVF
babies on developmental tests of intelligence or physical ability. </I>
