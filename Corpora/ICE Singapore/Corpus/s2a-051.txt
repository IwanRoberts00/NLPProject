<ICE-SIN:S2A-051#1:1>
Okay it's past ten now and I don't think there're any other people
coming

<ICE-SIN:S2A-051#2:1>
If they can and if they do come well they just come in right

<ICE-SIN:S2A-051#3:1>
Uhm my name is Dahlia

<ICE-SIN:S2A-051#4:1>
I'm a reference librarian and uh this tutorial is actually to acquaint
all of you with Linc and the resources in the library especially our new toy
the CD-Rom

<ICE-SIN:S2A-051#5:1>
And before I start how many of you have problems using Linc

<ICE-SIN:S2A-051#6:1>
What kind of problems do you encounter

<ICE-SIN:S2A-051#7:1>
Do you feel comfortable with it

<ICE-SIN:S2A-051#8:1>
Can you find everything that you want from Linc <X>

<ICE-SIN:S2A-051#X9:1>
student: What do you mean that we have the book but it's not in Linc
</X>

<ICE-SIN:S2A-051#10:1>
Okay our system just started running for about about two years or so

<ICE-SIN:S2A-051#11:1>
So we're still encountering a lot of <unclear> word </unclear>
problems

<ICE-SIN:S2A-051#12:1>
uhm all materials from 1980 onward should be in Linc

<ICE-SIN:S2A-051#13:1>
Prior to that they will be in micro on microfiche and in our old
database so we have not fully integrated everything right now

<ICE-SIN:S2A-051#14:1>
Have you used National library's uhm OPEC system

<ICE-SIN:S2A-051#15:1>
<O> student </O>

<ICE-SIN:S2A-051#16:1>
It's almost the same 'cause it's the first version

<ICE-SIN:S2A-051#17:1>
This is the enhanced version

<ICE-SIN:S2A-051#18:1>
And if we use National Library's uhm OPEC system you can place
reservations

<ICE-SIN:S2A-051#19:1>
You can check your borrow and records

<ICE-SIN:S2A-051#20:1>
You can find out whether that particular book is on loan or not

<ICE-SIN:S2A-051#21:1>
At the moment Linc does not cannot do that because it is not fully
integrated

<ICE-SIN:S2A-051#22:1>
All the other parts will take time and uh because of that they don't
seek your co-operation right

<ICE-SIN:S2A-051#23:1>
I think most of the time the problems that you have is not knowing
which particular menu to choose from

<ICE-SIN:S2A-051#24:1>
Which particular item on the menu to choose from

<ICE-SIN:S2A-051#25:1>
Whether to use Title Personal Authors Keywords right

<ICE-SIN:S2A-051#26:1>
And when you check a journal article you check you tend to look at
the journal title instead of the journal the title of the journal instead of
the articles right

<ICE-SIN:S2A-051#27:1>
I have a feeling that you look at let's say okay Dr Leo Suryadinata
wrote something on Overseas Chinese in Asian Survey

<ICE-SIN:S2A-051#28:1>
Instead of looking at Asian Survey all of you start keying in
Overseas Chinese right

<ICE-SIN:S2A-051#29:1>
Some of you do

<ICE-SIN:S2A-051#30:1>
I mean I I I I mean a lot of students come up to me and have have
that kind of problems okay

<ICE-SIN:S2A-051#31:1>
Basically Linc is made up of all titles

<ICE-SIN:S2A-051#32:1>
We have titles of books titles of journals in Linc

<ICE-SIN:S2A-051#33:1>
Okay the I-copies which are individual chapters from various journals
they're not in

<ICE-SIN:S2A-051#34:1>
If you want to find out a particular article on let's say Chinese
foreign policy Indonesian foreign policy anything like that from journals you
have to look up Abstracts and Indexes

<ICE-SIN:S2A-051#35:1>
We have that in the reference section but I doubt if many people use
it

<ICE-SIN:S2A-051#36:1>
Okay that's a very useful source of information because a lot of uh
materials on political science are written in journals

<ICE-SIN:S2A-051#37:1>
They're faster

<ICE-SIN:S2A-051#38:1>
If you write a book you have to wait what at least a year before
before it's published but journal articles you know it comes up very
regularly

<ICE-SIN:S2A-051#39:1>
You don't have to wait through three hundred pages or eight hundred
pages of it

<ICE-SIN:S2A-051#40:1>
You know usually it's about twenty pages or less

<ICE-SIN:S2A-051#41:1>
Everything is there

<ICE-SIN:S2A-051#42:1>
So I'm going to demonstrate Linc problems that I think students face
well

<ICE-SIN:S2A-051#43:1>
Those are the problems that they bring to the librarians at the
information desk

<ICE-SIN:S2A-051#44:1>
Okay

<ICE-SIN:S2A-051#45:1>
Okay titles

<ICE-SIN:S2A-051#46:1>
When you use Titles you must make sure that you use the exact title
of the book or the journal

<ICE-SIN:S2A-051#47:1>
You can use let's say bits and pieces of it

<ICE-SIN:S2A-051#48:1>
You know you can leave out 'and' 'the' all these articles but if you
want to retrieve very fast you use the exact title 'Writing Asian Survey' or
maybe the title of the book is 'The rise and fall of Mao Tse Tong' write the
whole thing

<ICE-SIN:S2A-051#49:1>
Then you can get it immediately

<ICE-SIN:S2A-051#50:1>
But if you were to type in you know only a few words the main words
in that title then you have to go through the Keyword search

<ICE-SIN:S2A-051#51:1>
Some people when they get that Keyword search you know oh there is no
exact match they just give up and leave

<ICE-SIN:S2A-051#52:1>
No you should not leave

<ICE-SIN:S2A-051#53:1>
You should go through the Keyword search

<ICE-SIN:S2A-051#54:1>
Combine the all the words then come up with that Title Personal
authors do your you use uhm surnames first in most of the names but for Malay
names you use as it is

<ICE-SIN:S2A-051#55:1>
Don't use the last name first

<ICE-SIN:S2A-051#56:1>
Organisations and Conferences

<ICE-SIN:S2A-051#57:1>
Organisations if you want to look up anything on the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs Monetary Authority of Singapore you use that one especially
Monetary Authority of Singapore Monthly

<ICE-SIN:S2A-051#58:1>
Statistics

<ICE-SIN:S2A-051#59:1>
We have the yearbook of Stats at the info desk but the monthly
quarterly there're all in the uhn Serials Department or the Current
Periodicals Department as everybody calls it

<ICE-SIN:S2A-051#60:1>
Conference Names well there are so many conferences all over the
place

<ICE-SIN:S2A-051#61:1>
It's very very useful es especially for the engineering students
because they depend a great deal on conferences and uhm symposiums

<ICE-SIN:S2A-051#62:1>
Subject headings

<ICE-SIN:S2A-051#63:1>
Ah ha that's the problem

<ICE-SIN:S2A-051#64:1>
I think that's the major problem

<ICE-SIN:S2A-051#65:1>
Everybody else

<ICE-SIN:S2A-051#66:1>
Subject headings are not you know Transportation that's it no tran

<ICE-SIN:S2A-051#67:1>
When you use Subject Headings you must use this Library of Congress
Subject Headings

<ICE-SIN:S2A-051#68:1>
We use this so that you can retrieve as much information on a
particular subject

<ICE-SIN:S2A-051#69:1>
For example you want something on MRT

<ICE-SIN:S2A-051#70:1>
Singapore calls it MRT

<ICE-SIN:S2A-051#71:1>
London it's called the tube or the underground

<ICE-SIN:S2A-051#72:1>
In New York it's called the underground

<ICE-SIN:S2A-051#73:1>
You see all

<ICE-SIN:S2A-051#74:1>
In Hong Kong it's all is called the NTRC or something like that

<ICE-SIN:S2A-051#75:1>
So all the different countries call it differently

<ICE-SIN:S2A-051#76:1>
In in San Francisco it's called Bart B-A-R-T so you call it
differently

<ICE-SIN:S2A-051#77:1>
There are five of us alright and each of us have different names for
it

<ICE-SIN:S2A-051#78:1>
How on earth are we going to find it

<ICE-SIN:S2A-051#79:1>
So we have Subject Headings to standardize all these terms

<ICE-SIN:S2A-051#80:1>
Another example is like battered women or abused women

<ICE-SIN:S2A-051#81:1>
You say battered women

<ICE-SIN:S2A-051#82:1>
I say abused women

<ICE-SIN:S2A-051#83:1>
If we don't see things eye to eye we don't meet each other and talk
about the same things nobody will be able to find out anything

<ICE-SIN:S2A-051#84:1>
You won't be able to find out the articles or the books that I write
and I won't be able to find out what you have written on that particular
subject

<ICE-SIN:S2A-051#85:1>
So you have to standardize

<ICE-SIN:S2A-051#86:1>
So that's why we use the Library of Congress of Subject headings so
you don't use your own uhm keywords or terms in it

<ICE-SIN:S2A-051#87:1>
Okay

<ICE-SIN:S2A-051#88:1>
Then you have the Series Title

<ICE-SIN:S2A-051#89:1>
Ah that's another tricky one because a lot of students type in the
title of the journal under Series Title and you can't find it at all

<ICE-SIN:S2A-051#90:1>
One very good example very good illustration of umm Series Title is
Mills and Boons

<ICE-SIN:S2A-051#91:1>
That's a Series Title

<ICE-SIN:S2A-051#92:1>
Okay

<ICE-SIN:S2A-051#93:1>
<O> laughter from the floor </O>

<ICE-SIN:S2A-051#94:1>
Some books they have to this particular series that's used but you
know I think Mills and Boons is a very very good example okay

<ICE-SIN:S2A-051#95:1>
Keywords

<ICE-SIN:S2A-051#96:1>
Keyword is a particular word which appears in all the various fields
meaning these are fields Titles Personal Authors

<ICE-SIN:S2A-051#97:1>
This is one field

<ICE-SIN:S2A-051#98:1>
This is second field

<ICE-SIN:S2A-051#99:1>
This is third field

<ICE-SIN:S2A-051#100:1>
Okay Keywords

<ICE-SIN:S2A-051#101:1>
Like the keyword Japan

<ICE-SIN:S2A-051#102:1>
It can appear in Title

<ICE-SIN:S2A-051#103:1>
It can appear in Organisation

<ICE-SIN:S2A-051#104:1>
It can appear in Subject Series Title

<ICE-SIN:S2A-051#105:1>
So maybe if you look under Titles Japan there are hundred titles

<ICE-SIN:S2A-051#106:1>
It says Japan and Singapore

<ICE-SIN:S2A-051#107:1>
The people of Japan

<ICE-SIN:S2A-051#108:1>
The women of Japan or something like that

<ICE-SIN:S2A-051#109:1>
All the books with titles

<ICE-SIN:S2A-051#110:1>
Japan now I don't know if anybody's anybody has been called Japan

<ICE-SIN:S2A-051#111:1>
Nah you can try

<ICE-SIN:S2A-051#112:1>
We've Organisations like uh MITI you know uhm whatever Japan trade
and industry that sort of thing

<ICE-SIN:S2A-051#113:1>
Subject Headings Japan and then Japan is subdivided into History
Literature uhm Economy Transportation

<ICE-SIN:S2A-051#114:1>
Okay you use Title Keywords

<ICE-SIN:S2A-051#115:1>
So when you use Keywords it picks up from all the various fields so
altogether you might end up to a thousand

<ICE-SIN:S2A-051#116:1>
Let's say this is five hundred

<ICE-SIN:S2A-051#117:1>
This is a hundred

<ICE-SIN:S2A-051#118:1>
This is another two hundred so you know it picked up

<ICE-SIN:S2A-051#119:1>
So that's that's where you get the keyword and the danger about
using Keywords is that you might end up retrieving information that you don't
need

<ICE-SIN:S2A-051#120:1>
You want Japanese foreign policy

<ICE-SIN:S2A-051#121:1>
If you use Keyword you just type in Japan it lists out everything
and anything on Japan

<ICE-SIN:S2A-051#122:1>
Japan and arts and culture

<ICE-SIN:S2A-051#123:1>
Japan Japanese History Japanese politics Japanese humour Japanese
films

<ICE-SIN:S2A-051#124:1>
So you have to be careful you have to know what you're searching for

<ICE-SIN:S2A-051#125:1>
But that does not mean that you only stop at one

<ICE-SIN:S2A-051#126:1>
If you're going to do Japan foreign policy you just stick to Subject
headings

<ICE-SIN:S2A-051#127:1>
When you're searching for information that's not that's not the way

<ICE-SIN:S2A-051#128:1>
Just imagine you're a detective you have to cover all the various
angles so you have to try the Titles

<ICE-SIN:S2A-051#129:1>
You have to try Subject headings as well as Keywords

<ICE-SIN:S2A-051#130:1>
Okay I'll show you what I'll show it to you but if I do that I have
to start this all over again

<ICE-SIN:S2A-051#131:1>
I'll just demonstrate the Title features

<ICE-SIN:S2A-051#132:1>
Okay how do you know whether that particular title is a book or a
journal

<ICE-SIN:S2A-051#133:1>
Do you guess from the title

<ICE-SIN:S2A-051#134:1>
Okay I'll use Title alright

<ICE-SIN:S2A-051#135:1>
The Asian Survey

<ICE-SIN:S2A-051#136:1>
It's only one journal The Asian Survey but it come up comes out
twice because this one has no full-stop and this one has full-stop

<ICE-SIN:S2A-051#137:1>
This is all part of computer technology

<ICE-SIN:S2A-051#138:1>
Okay when you get this you press A

<ICE-SIN:S2A-051#139:1>
Okay this is the full display

<ICE-SIN:S2A-051#140:1>
When you only have one title they will automatically give you the
full display

<ICE-SIN:S2A-051#141:1>
Full display the difference is you have Subject

<ICE-SIN:S2A-051#142:1>
You have Names here

<ICE-SIN:S2A-051#143:1>
You don't have you see in a brief display you don't have all these
things

<ICE-SIN:S2A-051#144:1>
Volume for March nineteen sixty one ecetera ecetera okay

<ICE-SIN:S2A-051#145:1>
Okay I'll show you the brief format

<ICE-SIN:S2A-051#146:1>
Just type B for brief format

<ICE-SIN:S2A-051#147:1>
This is the brief format

<ICE-SIN:S2A-051#148:1>
How do you know find how do you know whether it's a journal or not

<ICE-SIN:S2A-051#149:1>
Look at at this Copy Description Volume one nineteen sixty one dash

<ICE-SIN:S2A-051#150:1>
It does not mean we only have nineteen sixty one

<ICE-SIN:S2A-051#151:1>
We 've started buying from nineteen sixty one onwards dash that
there're still others

<ICE-SIN:S2A-051#152:1>
If you see an asterisk that means nineteen sixty one dash nineteen
seventy asterisk that means the last issue that we have is nineteen seventy

<ICE-SIN:S2A-051#153:1>
If you have books you're looking at books they don't have this

<ICE-SIN:S2A-051#154:1>
So that's the difference

<ICE-SIN:S2A-051#155:1>
That's how you find out

<ICE-SIN:S2A-051#156:1>
Anything can be in Tamil

<ICE-SIN:S2A-051#157:1>
It can be in in whatever in Greek or in Russian you see that you
know

<ICE-SIN:S2A-051#158:1>
Call number

<ICE-SIN:S2A-051#159:1>
The call number is this one

<ICE-SIN:S2A-051#160:1>
Or that's uhm some of the let's say you see U asterisk whatever it
is okay

<ICE-SIN:S2A-051#161:1>
Ah those some those are just part of our cataloging rules so that
one that's alright you see

<ICE-SIN:S2A-051#162:1>
Oh small f means folio stands for folio

<ICE-SIN:S2A-051#163:1>
Folio means books that are not uh bigger than normal size so we
usually shelve them at the last two shelves because we cannot accommodate
them in the normal size shelves

<ICE-SIN:S2A-051#164:1>
You see most of the books are about what this twenty-three inches or
something like

<ICE-SIN:S2A-051#165:1>
I think two cm then if it's uh bigger than that you think you're
gonna have usually the last

<ICE-SIN:S2A-051#166:1>
Let's say you have DA from D to DZ so after DZ of the normal size
books then you have the folio books

<ICE-SIN:S2A-051#167:1>
The f books okay

<ICE-SIN:S2A-051#168:1>
Okay because of system fully integrated you only see CL

<ICE-SIN:S2A-051#169:1>
That means if it's fully integrated you see CLMS which is main
shelves main shelf meaning also open shelf

<ICE-SIN:S2A-051#170:1>
You can borrow the book

<ICE-SIN:S2A-051#171:1>
CLBP Bound Periodicals

<ICE-SIN:S2A-051#172:1>
CLCS Close Stack that means we cannot put all our materials
especially journals on the shelf <X>

<ICE-SIN:S2A-051#X173:1>
We just don't have space so the material that's kept in Bound
Periodicals starts from nineteen eighty to nineteen eighty-nine to nineteen
ninety and the rest will be in our Close Stack our storeroom so you have to
go to the query counter fill in a search card or a Close Stack slip this one
mhm mhm then the staff will go down twice a day to hoo collect your books
that you've requested if you come in now and ask them to do it you know you
have to wait you know because they only go down twice a day we can't afford
to do that all the time because we have a whole stack of slips <&>  student)
Past year For those that are no no no no those are kept those are the uh uhm
the the bound periodicals you can jolly well go down and get it but those
prior to that from nineteen sixty one to let's say nineteen seventy-nine okay
they're kept in our uh uhm storeroom okay uhm those are journals same with
some books where especially when we have multiple copies too many copies okay
right now it can't really tell you you can check with query counter whether
the book is on loan or not just cannot tell Maybe if you've used National
Library system you can see that you know each volume or each each year it
depends on how they bound they bind it will have uhm different bar code
number and you know then you'll have to scroll through from nineteen
sixty-one that's assuming that nineteen six each year has been bound one
volume so you have let's say until seventy-one there're ten so on about
thirty volumes but there are some journals that start from eighteen something
eighteen eighty-eight so you just have to sit down and scroll through page by
page and page until you find out the volume you're looking for That's
journals for you okay do you have any particular title in mind That you want
to search <&>  student </&> Okay you want to go <&>  student </&> okay if you want to go
back to the other page you just press R for reselect reselect <&>  student </&> you
have uh let's say twenty items okay anytime you want to get out you either
press uhm function eight I think you need to stop or you press full stop
return let's see okay let's look at I mean you know when you use Keywords or
when you use Subject Headings or Titles don't be so foolish as to type in
let's say Indonesia because you'll get a million and one items okay you get
you have this right If okay this is item number one and for this particular
heading there is one alright so your main the main thing is to get this so ah
let's say you want to look at number four which is Indonesia - a Profile If
you press four press enter it'll show you what you just selected then let's
say you want to look at number four number thirteen number twenty-seven okay
anytime you want to go back you just press R okay then you have to use the
Gather function which is G you can add another key word if you want let's say
keyword you just press key and then you get what you want okay let's say you
use Gather four press enter for next page press G again let's say eleven
until fifteen after you've gathered all those things then you press L for
List anythime you want to go back you know don't worry you know you can
always go stan <&>  go astern </&> just press R for reselect okay In Process you've
seen that before haven't you In Process that means we're still processing the
book and six million dollar question is when will it arrive don't know when
okay when will it appear okay you know this right This is Law main shelf Law
library Central library call number one so in future everything will be like
this and then you have the number of copies so you don't have to go round
searching asking everybody how many copies do you have in the library one
seven ten everything will be there okay If you want to look at the full
format of let's say number two just press F space two Full Format okay You
press B you get Brief Format you scan okay you want to see number three but
you don't want to see the full format I mean it's very disjointed you want to
go on to the next page you just press B space three number three's is at the
top </X> </I>
