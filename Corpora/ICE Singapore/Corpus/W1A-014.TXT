<ICE-SIN:W1A-014#2:1>
<h> Introduction </h>

<ICE-SIN:W1A-014#3:1>
With Kuhn, the denise of Foundationalism became
evident. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-014#4:1>
Kuhn's distinction between normal science &
revolutionary science has brought the problem of incommensurability to the
surface. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-014#5:1>
Normal science is a paradigm-directed
activity. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-014#6:1>
And so, there is kind of foundation within
the normal science constituted by the adherence to shared data, standards,
meanings and even worlds. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-014#7:1>
Hence, there is little
ambiguity and problem in comparing different theories that attempt to
articulate the paradigm in different directions. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-014#8:1>
So, if all science were normal science, then the problem of
incommensurability would not arise. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-014#9:1>
However Kuhn also discovered another period
of science which he calls revolutionary science. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-014#10:1>
This period is characterised by proliferation of theories. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-014#11:1>
And since theories bring their own data, standards, & facts, so there is no
longer any common foundation. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-014#12:1>
The foundation which we
had during normal science is only a paradigm - relative one.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-014#13:1>
Besides, meaning holism also entails that theories
cannot communicate. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-014#14:1>
So confronted with this problem of
incommensurability, Churchland proposes his semantic theory as a means of
bridging the gap between theories so that they need not be regarded as
absolutely incommensurable. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-014#15:1>
<h> Churchland's semantic & systemic sentences </h> 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-014#16:1>
Churchland distinguishes
between 2 kinds of sentences namely systemically and semantically important
sentences in an individual's T-set. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-014#17:1>
An individual's T-set is the set of all sentences containing the term, say T,
that he accepts. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-014#18:1>
Out of this T-set, there is likely to be a
subset of sentences which are more theoretically important sentences.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-014#19:1>
These define the individual's understanding of the
term, T. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-014#20:1>
As such, any changes in the set of
systemically important sentences would have tremendous impact on the belief
system of the individual. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-014#21:1>
Any variation in
understanding would necessitate an extensive readjustment and revision of the
belief system that he holds. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-014#22:1>
The semantically
important sentences are those which define the meaning of a term.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-014#23:1>
They are those on whose acceptance, the smoothness and
efficiency of one's verbal commerce in a linguistic community is maximally
dependent. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-014#24:1>
This is because shared meaning depends on
the sharing of these sentences more than it depends on others.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-014#25:1>
These sentences form the baseline of a linguistic
community. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-014#26:1>
They are the common framework that one
speaker expects to find in another. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-014#27:1>
Does Churchland's
theory enable us to circumvent the problem of incommensurability?

<ICE-SIN:W1A-014#28:1>
Churchland accepts the thesis of holism.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-014#29:1>
However, his theory is able to overcome the problem of
incommensurability because his theory allows for a kind of non-foundational
epistemology. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-014#30:1>
Since menaing is social and
understanding is private, the commensurability between paradigms depend on
the sharing of the semantically more important sentences.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-014#31:1>
According to Churchland, 2 paradigms, say the
Newtonians and the Einsteinians can communicate with each other because the
have the same meaning. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-014#32:1>
A term has the same meaning for
2 speakers if the set of their semantically important sentences containing
this term has the same membership. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-014#33:1>
However, there may
be cases where there is no perfect match between their set of semantically
important sentences. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-014#34:1>
They may disagree about the
semantic status of some sentences. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-014#35:1>
In this case,
Churchland would attest that communication need not be terminated.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-014#36:1>
The speakers can fall on the extensive substructure of
meaning that remains shared between them and approach the problematic topic
anew. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-014#37:1>
If this discussion is successful, then the
disputed sentences may get thrown out either by one speaker being is on over
to the semantic status of the other or by the agreement on both parties to
come to a compromise structure in the course of the debate.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-014#38:1>
Hence, this shows that perfect correspondence of set
of semantically important sentences is not a necessary condition for
commensurability. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-014#39:1>
And its absence is of no practical
sifnificance. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-014#40:1>
The conflicting paradigms can still
communicate with each other with untroubled fluency. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-014#41:1>
This shows that on Churchland's theory, commensurability and meaning
solipsism ( whereby terms lose its meaning once taken out of the context of
the paradigm) is less dramatic. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-014#42:1>
It becomes merely a
matter of degree, ranging from negligible ( where their set of semantically
impt sentences almost perfectly coincide) to unbridgeable ( where there is no
shared semantically important sentences at all as in the case of violently
conflicting paradigms.) 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-014#43:1>
Hence, this shows that
although Churchland accepts the thesis of theory ladenness, his theory is
able to avoid radical holism. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-014#44:1>
Meaning depends on the
sharing of the subset of semantically important sentences and not by the set
of all accepted sentences. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-014#45:1>
Hence, his theory is, so to
speak, quasi holistic. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-014#46:1>
However, Churchland's theory is
unique because there could still be epistemology even in the absence of an
absolute found. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-014#47:1>
The semantically important sentences
common in both paradigm's T-set could act as a " foundation", on the basis of
which their differences can be approached and arbitrated.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-014#48:1>
However, it is not a permanent, natural foundation
which is independent of both paradigms. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-014#49:1>
Instead, it is
only an artificially forged foundation from the 2 frameworks in conflict.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-014#50:1>
Hence, the above account of Churchland's theory shows
that the problem of incommensurability is not so severe as to cut off any
communication link between paradigms. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-014#51:1>
Paradigms can
still communicate and be compared. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-014#52:1>
So the nature of
scientific progress need not be rejected as irrational.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-014#53:1>
<h> Conclusion </h> 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-014#54:1>
However,
despite its ability to circumvent the problem of incommensurability,
Churchland's theory does not seem to give a realistic portrayal of the way we
do science. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-014#55:1>
The process of listing all relevant
sentences and thereafter sorting them into semantically and systemically
important ones seem like a tedious chore and is not very practical.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-014#56:1>
Besides, Chruchland's account is too simplistic.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-014#57:1>
Real life situations may be more complicated & hence
more problematic. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-014#58:1>
There may be cases where there is
just simply no insolvable substructure genuinely shared between the paradigms
that can act as a basis which allows for their commensurability.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-014#59:1>
Hence, although Churchland's theory can avoid the
problem of incommensurability between similar paradigms, his theory becomes
questionable in the face of violently conflicting paradigms. </I>

Q2 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-014#61:2>
<h> Introduction </h>

<ICE-SIN:W1A-014#62:2>
According to Kemery, there is one method through which
all scientific theories go through in their development.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-014#63:2>
And He calls this method the methodological cycle.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-014#64:2>
The peculiarity of this cycle is that " science must
start from facts and end with facts". 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-014#65:2>
Within this
cycle, two processes can be distinguished. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-014#66:2>
They are:-

<ICE-SIN:W1A-014#67:2>
( i)the formation of possible theories which comes
under the context of discovery and 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-014#68:2>
( ii) the selection
of one of these, falling under the context of justification.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-014#69:2>
In this essay, I shall deal with each of these in
turn. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-014#70:2>
Context of Discovery Kemery places a high degree
of importance to the role of observation or induction the formation of
theories. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-014#71:2>
Induction is the process of forming theories
on the basis of a set of facts. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-014#72:2>
It involves going from
particular statements to a general conclusion . 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-014#73:2>
For
example, after watching the sun for several days, the scientist concludes:-

<ICE-SIN:W1A-014#74:2>
( i)The sun rises in the east for the past hundred
days. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-014#75:2>
( a collection of facts) 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-014#76:2>
( ii) ( therefore in mathematical symbol) the sun rises in the east everyday
( a theory). 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-014#77:2>
So this is the process of induction which
Kemery states that all scientific theories go through. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-014#78:2>
This is the job of an empirical scientist. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-014#79:2>
The
empirical scientist performs experiments which allows him to make controlled
and meticulous observation of nature. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-014#80:2>
He then collects
facts from his experiments and these facts constitute his observation
reports. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-014#81:2>
As more and more facts are collected, general
features become discernible. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-014#82:2>
However, a collection of
facts does not constitute a science. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-014#83:2>
From collection
of facts, the scientist must make a conception of the world.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-014#84:2>
He then ( the theoretical scientist) formulate a
theory and atttempt to fit the theory into the discernible features ( the
known facts). 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-014#85:2>
Hence, the above describes the process
of formation of theories. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-014#86:2>
Kemery's account of the
discovery of theories is a neat, safe and cautious account ( ie through the
inductive method) unlike that proposed by Pepper ( ie through the method of
putting forth bold hypothesis and daring conjectures unconstrained by data).

<ICE-SIN:W1A-014#87:2>
<h> Context of Justification </h>

<ICE-SIN:W1A-014#88:2>
However, after the forming of theories, the scientist
must test his theory to see if they accord with facts. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-014#89:2>
This step is necessary because given a set of facts, there are many theories
which could equally well explain the same collection of data.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-014#90:2>
So how do we know which of these theories to accept?

<ICE-SIN:W1A-014#91:2>
Hence, the need to justify them.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-014#92:2>
Kemery proposes the criterion of credibility to test
theories. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-014#93:2>
But one cannot just test a theory against
facts. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-014#94:2>
Theoretical statements are general statements
while factual statements are particular. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-014#95:2>
One cannot
test that the sun rises everyday. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-014#96:2>
What one does test
is that it rose yesterday, it rises today and will rise tomorrow.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-014#97:2>
Hence, the scientist must reduce his theory to
particular statements and he does this through the process of deduction which
is a purely logical process. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-014#98:2>
For example, the
scientist deduces:- 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-014#99:2>
( i)the sun rises in the east
everyday " ( a theory) 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-014#100:2>
( ii) ( therefore in
mathematical symbol) the sun will rise in the east tomorrow ( a prediction).

<ICE-SIN:W1A-014#101:2>
Hence, it is the logical consequence of the theory or
its prediction that the scientist later goes on to test.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-014#102:2>
According to Kemery, one test a theory by again
looking at facts. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-014#103:2>
But now, one looks for more
supportive evidence to confirm the theory. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-014#104:2>
The more
facts or evidence one can gather from nature to support the theory, the more
verified the theory becomes and hence, the more credible it is.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-014#105:2>
This is the case if the prediction that the theory
generates accord with facts. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-014#106:2>
But what happens when
the predictions do not agree with subsequent observations?

<ICE-SIN:W1A-014#107:2>
Kemery says that theories need not be rejected
immediately if their predictions do not get verifies. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-014#108:2>
This is because when one makes a prediction, one does not do it on the basis
of this theory alone but together with other auxiliary theories.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-014#109:2>
hence, it is not clear which of these 2 theories (
the theory under test or the auxiliary theories) are at fault.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-014#110:2>
Hence, what one should do is to try to modify one's
auxiliary theories and not reject one's theory immediately.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-014#111:2>
However, even if one's theory gets verified all the
time, this does not mean that the theory is proven certain.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-014#112:2>
This is because given a theory there are numerous
predictions that can be made. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-014#113:2>
So however many
predictions one test, one has not tested all of them. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-014#114:2>
So the implication is that one's theory only becomes more probable the more
verifications it gets but never proven true. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-014#115:2>
And, the
more verifications it gets, the more probable it becomes and one has then
discovered a new law. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-014#116:2>
Some criticisms against
Kemery's method. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-014#117:2>
Like other theories, Kemery's
methodological cycle is also not free from criticisms.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-014#118:2>
The most severe criticism of his methodology comes
from Popper. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-014#119:2>
Popper criticises both of Kemery's
account of the formation and justification of theories.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-014#120:2>
With regards to the formation of theories, Popper
asserts that if science should follow such an inductive method, it will
become merely an irrational enterprise. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-014#121:2>
Popper
accepts Hume's criticism of the inductive method. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-014#122:2>
Hume claims that one can never justify the inductive method.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-014#123:2>
Induction is an invalid process because it is based
on an unjustified belief that nature is ordered and uniform.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-014#124:2>
However, according to Hume, there is no guarantee
that just because nature has been uniformly functioning in the past, it will
continue to do so always. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-014#125:2>
Such a claim cannot be
empirically justified. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-014#126:2>
So Popper regards this method
as a pseudo-empirical one. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-014#127:2>
Popper even rejects Hume's
argument that although we cannot give a logical account of induction, we can
justify our employment of this method on the basis of habit and custom.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-014#128:2>
But Popper disagrees with this argument because of
science is undercut, leading to a scepticism about scientific knowledge.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-014#129:2>
Hence Kemery's methodological cycle has a weak and
illegitimate link ( ie induction). 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-014#130:2>
Besides, Popper
also disagrees with Kemery's method of starting with the collection of facts.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-014#131:2>
This is because he asserts that there are infinity of
facts that can be collected but surely not all of these are relevant in the
formation of a particular theory. <X> 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-014#X132:2>
Popper thinks
that there is no such thing as " pure" observation. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-014#X133:2>
Observation is always theory-directed. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-014#X134:2>
It is like a
beam of light which searches. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-014#X135:2>
It searches for
relevant facts. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-014#X136:2>
But to search for relevant facts we
need the guidance of a theory itself. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-014#X137:2>
hence Popper
thinks that there is an inevitable vicious circle in Kemery's methodological
cycle. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-014#X138:2>
And if science were to go through this cycle,
then science will never get off the ground at all. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-014#X139:2>

As for Kemery's account of the method of justifying theories, Popper thinks
that the verification criterion is not a good criterion.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-014#X140:2>
This is because he claims that if we use
verification as the criterion of demarcating scientific from
pseudo-scientific theories, then there would be no ground for denying
Freudian psychoanalysis, Marxist theory and astrology from the status of a
science. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-014#X141:2>
These theories do get verifications all the
time. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-014#X142:2>
However, Popper argues that it is easy to find
verifications if one looks for them. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-014#X143:2>
The world is
full of verifications for nearly every theory. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-014#X144:2>
Hence, verification cannot be the criterion of science.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-014#X145:2>
The confirming instances that we find to support the
theory proves nothing except that the observation report can be interpreted
in the light of the theory. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-014#X146:2>
Kemery's verification
method does not give any condition under which the scientist is willing to
give up the theory. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-014#X147:2>
And this is characteristic of
the other non-scientific theories. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-014#X148:2>
A good scientific
theory, according to Popper, must be a " prohibition." It must give a
condition under which the theory must be refuted. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-014#X149:2>
Hence, Popper rejects verificationism in favour of falsificationism.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-014#X150:2>
Thus, the above account shows that although Kemery's
methodological account of science is a neat account and simple to follow, yet
its credibility is doubtful. </X> </I>
