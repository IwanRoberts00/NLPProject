<ICE-SIN:S2A-015#1:1:A>
The start of the second game

<ICE-SIN:S2A-015#2:1:A>
The first one having been won in handsome style by Singapore fifteen
to seven

<ICE-SIN:S2A-015#3:1:A>
Singapore on the right side of your screen

<ICE-SIN:S2A-015#4:1:A>
Philippines was a little cynical with its serve love all

<ICE-SIN:S2A-015#5:1:A>
That was on the line

<ICE-SIN:S2A-015#6:1:A>
Philippines grabbing the first point one zero

<ICE-SIN:S2A-015#7:1:A>
That went right

<ICE-SIN:S2A-015#8:1:A>
Good save from Singapore and that was a weak return

<ICE-SIN:S2A-015#9:1:A>
I'm half surprised that they can't reach that one

<ICE-SIN:S2A-015#10:1:A>
It was perfectly set up for the Philippines to drive it down to the
Singapore court

<ICE-SIN:S2A-015#11:1:A>
So Philippines leading one zero

<ICE-SIN:S2A-015#12:1:A>
Well that's coming over for Singapore

<ICE-SIN:S2A-015#13:1:A>
Oh no oh that's a bad defend of Singapore

<ICE-SIN:S2A-015#14:1:A>
Let's see if they should try to block this one

<ICE-SIN:S2A-015#15:1:A>
Oh yes it's just too easy

<ICE-SIN:S2A-015#16:1:A>
Singapore a little bit unsettled at this stage and let's hope that
uh they realise that they haven't won yet

<ICE-SIN:S2A-015#17:1:A>
Let's have a what happened was the oh that short set set up by
Singapore side very effective for the Philippines in this array

<ICE-SIN:S2A-015#18:1:A>
That was out but it was deflected by the Singa by the Philippine
defender

<ICE-SIN:S2A-015#19:1:A>
Singapore trailing one two

<ICE-SIN:S2A-015#20:1:A>
And that was a good short set

<ICE-SIN:S2A-015#21:1:A>
Two one Philippines

<ICE-SIN:S2A-015#22:1:A>
For all we should have got that Singapore's number two Liew Teow
Kah number eleven scaling heights went right on top of the net and force it
in between the little gap between the blockers and the net

<ICE-SIN:S2A-015#23:1:A>
Philippines saying thank you very much we'll do exactly the same
thing

<ICE-SIN:S2A-015#24:1:A>
Philippines three one

<ICE-SIN:S2A-015#25:1:A>
That was bad bounce from Singapore's Ng Chee Ho and I'm not
surprised that the Philippines leading four one

<ICE-SIN:S2A-015#26:1:A>
Not by tinge of any spectacular or play from them mind you more
because of Singapore's errors and the this is a timely call out a timely time
out called by the Singapore coach Chen as uh the score is four one

<ICE-SIN:S2A-015#27:1:A>
We don't want things to deteriorate any further than this

<ICE-SIN:S2A-015#28:1:A>
We want to stand uh any chance of getting into the game without a
great deal of effort

<ICE-SIN:S2A-015#29:1:A>
Singapore then trailing one four and Philippines with the serve

<ICE-SIN:S2A-015#30:1:A>
Right in front of the net of Singapore's Aubrey Ong number two here
he is with a short set <unclear> word </unclear> nicely by Chian Lin Chong
number ten

<ICE-SIN:S2A-015#31:1:A>
That was Kay of uh Singapore just trying to do a little bit too
much off balance and he tried to to set it up

<ICE-SIN:S2A-015#32:1:A>
The ball went over the net too close to the and well it went over
the Philippines side

<ICE-SIN:S2A-015#33:1:A>
Singapore serve

<ICE-SIN:S2A-015#34:1:A>
Still the Singapore team and a great deal of oh it must have been
too long yes it's way out

<ICE-SIN:S2A-015#35:1:A>
Don't know what Kay was trying to do there

<ICE-SIN:S2A-015#36:1:A>
Made a couple of mistakes in a row

<ICE-SIN:S2A-015#37:1:A>
That's going out as well and the one from Oliver Balzeh

<ICE-SIN:S2A-015#38:1:A>
So both teams showing signs of not too very settled but broke off
with that serve from the from that smash from the Philippines is the is the
serve again

<ICE-SIN:S2A-015#39:1:A>
That's right one four Singapore behind

<ICE-SIN:S2A-015#40:1:A>
It's time they did something to get a few points on the board

<ICE-SIN:S2A-015#41:1:A>
With good luck Singapore could set it up

<ICE-SIN:S2A-015#42:1:A>
Singapore team losing confidence

<ICE-SIN:S2A-015#43:1:A>
Oh that's an effective

<ICE-SIN:S2A-015#44:1:A>
Yes even the Philippine player number seven Bob Malenlub said yes I
did touch that before it went out

<ICE-SIN:S2A-015#45:1:A>
Singapore gets a point then two four trailing in the second game

<ICE-SIN:S2A-015#46:1:A>
Wonderful block two of the taller players from the Singapore side
number ten and eleven Chiang Yu Chang and Lui Teow Kah

<ICE-SIN:S2A-015#47:1:A>
Singapore keeping up three four

<ICE-SIN:S2A-015#48:1:A>
There you are and it's all tied up this time the Philippines wants
the to have a substitution

<ICE-SIN:S2A-015#49:1:A>
In comes Roskito <unclear> word </unclear> <unclear> word
</unclear> there goes Oliver Balzeh number two

<ICE-SIN:S2A-015#50:1:A>
Here's the new player number six Roskito <unclear> word </unclear>
<unclear> word </unclear> First <unclear> word </unclear> to the ball

<ICE-SIN:S2A-015#51:1:A>
And that was the you can watch here the captain of the Philippine
team Antonio Ladimo Junior slamming that down

<ICE-SIN:S2A-015#52:1:A>
Oh that was right that was out

<ICE-SIN:S2A-015#53:1:A>
In the flurry of the battle Bob Halinup number seven not able to
control the ball

<ICE-SIN:S2A-015#54:1:A>
It's still four all Singapore with the serve

<ICE-SIN:S2A-015#55:1:A>
The red bulls from Singapore

<ICE-SIN:S2A-015#56:1:A>
That was long

<ICE-SIN:S2A-015#57:1:A>
That was right and Singapore for the first timeof this game move
ahead five points to four in this set the Philippines coach Sinthornio
<unclear> word </unclear> says okay I want to talk you fellows come up and he
gets thirty seconds to talk things over trying to find out what happened

<ICE-SIN:S2A-015#58:1:A>
Philippines was way ahead four one

<ICE-SIN:S2A-015#59:1:A>
You see the smiles on the Singapore teams on the Singapore faces

<ICE-SIN:S2A-015#60:1:A>
Five four Singapore ahead

<ICE-SIN:S2A-015#61:1:A>
There is Liew Teow Kah all one point eight four metres of him
behind that shot <unclear> word </unclear>

<ICE-SIN:S2A-015#62:1:A>
Ng Chee Ho Singapore ahead four six

<ICE-SIN:S2A-015#63:1:A>
An infringement from Chia Min Chong of Singapore <unclear> word
</unclear> embarassment perhaps

<ICE-SIN:S2A-015#64:1:A>
Well that was a bad serve

<ICE-SIN:S2A-015#65:1:A>
Bob Malinup

<ICE-SIN:S2A-015#66:1:A>
He's made a few errors for his side

<ICE-SIN:S2A-015#67:1:A>
Six five

<ICE-SIN:S2A-015#68:1:A>
Singapore fourth set coming on and I said yes and he took full
advantage of that

<ICE-SIN:S2A-015#69:1:A>
There was no one blocking up there Rostiko <unclear> word
</unclear> Kamandian for the Philippines putting it other way

<ICE-SIN:S2A-015#70:1:A>
Now there you saw the Singapore team taking the the blockers on the
Philippines side out

<ICE-SIN:S2A-015#71:1:A>
They meant to have attempted uh pretended to spike the ball and
that was <unclear> word </unclear> wide and Singapore pulling ahead steadily

<ICE-SIN:S2A-015#72:1:A>
Singapore should be able to get this over

<ICE-SIN:S2A-015#73:1:A>
Wonder if the Philippines can?

<ICE-SIN:S2A-015#74:1:A>
Oh that's a weak return from the Philippines

<ICE-SIN:S2A-015#75:1:A>
And that's <unclear> word </unclear> yes went out the fingers of
the defenders the setters <unclear> word </unclear> and Arthur <unclear> word
</unclear>

<ICE-SIN:S2A-015#76:1:A>
And Singapore ahead eight five and Mahmon with the serve of the
Philippines number five

<ICE-SIN:S2A-015#77:1:A>
Loo Weng Hwa

<ICE-SIN:S2A-015#78:1:A>
He's right on really victory as that went in eight five

<ICE-SIN:S2A-015#79:1:A>
I think it was long Oh no I think touch by one of the players on
the Singapore side deflected out

<ICE-SIN:S2A-015#80:1:A>
So Philippines get to serve and it's Rostiko <unclear> word
</unclear> Kamandian <unclear> word </unclear>

<ICE-SIN:S2A-015#81:1:A>
That was a surprising attack from Singapore's Tay Chee Keong the
setter Au Puay Yong instead of serving it to the front serve it to the back

<ICE-SIN:S2A-015#82:1:A>
And Chee Keong was up to the challenge

<ICE-SIN:S2A-015#83:1:A>
Loo Weng Hwa definitely the live wire right now rallying his team

<ICE-SIN:S2A-015#84:1:A>
Nine five with Sing Singapore ahead of the Philippines and this is
definitely not a result that was that would was expected by the other teams
in the SEA Games

<ICE-SIN:S2A-015#85:1:A>
It was deflected and it was a net infringement by the Philippines

<ICE-SIN:S2A-015#86:1:A>
Net infringement by the Philippines and their uh their captain
arguing and he is going to be given a talking to by the first referee

<ICE-SIN:S2A-015#87:1:A>
Singapore flag as I mention coming out and the well as you can see
at the base of your picture Antonio talking back to the second referee which
you're not suppose to actually

<ICE-SIN:S2A-015#88:1:A>
The rules actually say that if there're any protest the only people
who can actually direct them are the coach as well as the captain and the
Antonio is actually the captain

<ICE-SIN:S2A-015#89:1:A>
I don't know what the protest was but perhaps he was just
protesting too much

<ICE-SIN:S2A-015#90:1:A>
Well back to play and Singapore straying their shots and that was a
yawning gap back there which the Philippines exploited to great effect

<ICE-SIN:S2A-015#91:1:A>
They get to serve five to ten oh that's too close to the net

<ICE-SIN:S2A-015#92:1:A>
Singapore hasn't doesn't seem to be as settled as in the first game
but perhaps it was the Philippines who has began to tighten their game just a
little more

<ICE-SIN:S2A-015#93:1:A>
Here we go with uh Oh yes Antonio Antonio <unclear> word </unclear>
Junior number captain doing the captain's job for the Philippines seven ten
they're still trailing

<ICE-SIN:S2A-015#94:1:A>
But Singapore not doing what they should be that's a well it's a
poor set and in comes Tan Hai Peng and out goes Ng Chee Ho number twelve man

<ICE-SIN:S2A-015#95:1:A>
Tan Hai Peng the most exuberant player at the Singapore side and
he's a brilliant player but uh his sometimes his brilliance causes him to
make little errors unnecessary ones

<ICE-SIN:S2A-015#96:1:A>
And the time Phauy Bao Shen with Singapore leading ten points to
nine in the second game of this best of five game encounter

<ICE-SIN:S2A-015#97:1:A>
The Philippines putting up a much stronger defence as well as uh uh
attack

<ICE-SIN:S2A-015#98:1:A>
Uhm I think that this has forced Singapore into quite a number of
errors and it is to their credit Singapore credit that they have maintained
their their lead uhm but uh it's gonna be a tight one the rest of this game

<ICE-SIN:S2A-015#99:1:A>
The players come back then with the score nine ten in favour
Singapore what the Philippines were to serve <unclear> word </unclear> with a
pony tail

<ICE-SIN:S2A-015#100:1:A>
The Singapore defence doing well behind the three legal line

<ICE-SIN:S2A-015#101:1:A>
That's the second point that they have scored

<ICE-SIN:S2A-015#102:1:A>
Oh it's deflected

<ICE-SIN:S2A-015#103:1:A>
Bob Halinub number seven of the Philippines <unclear> word
</unclear> net

<ICE-SIN:S2A-015#104:1:A>
Eleven nine

<ICE-SIN:S2A-015#105:1:A>
The ball dipped as he went over the net oh yes Singapore
retrieving but it went out

<ICE-SIN:S2A-015#106:1:A>
Philippines nine eleven

<ICE-SIN:S2A-015#107:1:A>
Singapore get to serve and uh eleven for Singapore

<ICE-SIN:S2A-015#108:1:A>
Phuay Teow Kah pouting his lips in anticipation

<ICE-SIN:S2A-015#109:1:A>
That's a very hard serve and it's went out the solid wall
Singapore

<ICE-SIN:S2A-015#110:1:A>
I can tell you that Antonio <unclear> word </unclear> their
captain was amazed that the that his full-blooded smash watch him coming it
in and watch the ball rebounding off the block and the the expression on his
face was priceless as he saw that the ball had rebounded and that the
Philippine that his team could not retrieve it

<ICE-SIN:S2A-015#111:1:A>
The score now twelve nine Singapore knocking on the door of uh of
the of the second game and showing the Philippines bronze medal winners last
the last SEA Games a thing or two about how to play volleyball

<ICE-SIN:S2A-015#112:1:A>
But it's not over as they say until the final point has been
scored but Singapore twelve nine uhm the Philippine team oh yes Singapore
should be able to set this up

<ICE-SIN:S2A-015#113:1:A>
Watch this space <unclear> word </unclear>

<ICE-SIN:S2A-015#114:1:A>
Fifteen nine as the referee from Indonesia caught an infringement
from the Philippines side Philippines unable to handle the smash very well

<ICE-SIN:S2A-015#115:1:A>
Oh good block right in the front from Singapore

<ICE-SIN:S2A-015#116:1:A>
Yes and that's credit a <unclear> word </unclear> going through
with his smash

<ICE-SIN:S2A-015#117:1:A>
You've seen the the blocks Nine thirteen Philippines trailing
Singapore

<ICE-SIN:S2A-015#118:1:A>
Yes a good serve a good fight Rosito Kamundian <unclear> word
</unclear> from the Philippines

<ICE-SIN:S2A-015#119:1:A>
That was legal deflected just went over the Filipino defender but
it was prevent from coming over Eleven thirteen

<ICE-SIN:S2A-015#120:1:A>
That was in Thirteen eleven Singapore fight back to get the serve
and it's Lui Teow Kah Singapore retrieving it but it's an easy set out for
the Philippines Rostiko Kamundia

<ICE-SIN:S2A-015#121:1:A>
Philippines eleven thirteen behind yes that slipped through the
Philippines defence

<ICE-SIN:S2A-015#122:1:A>
Thirteen eleven Singapore and a change over the Philippines side
is the captain comes out who'd been replaced by Ariel Delucrux <unclear> word
</unclear> number nine and Ruseda <unclear> word </unclear> comes out

<ICE-SIN:S2A-015#123:1:A>
He'd been replaced by Balei Tupas the first time I have seen him
in this game

<ICE-SIN:S2A-015#124:1:A>
So that's Hosea Leitasu the man with the pony tails has gone up
and Singapore also replacing a couple of players bringing some new blood in

<ICE-SIN:S2A-015#125:1:A>
Ng Yong Seng with the serve number eight for Singapore

<ICE-SIN:S2A-015#126:1:A>
Thirteen eleven

<ICE-SIN:S2A-015#127:1:A>
He has a big task ahead of him if he can get these two points

<ICE-SIN:S2A-015#128:1:A>
Well that's what he was sent in there for

<ICE-SIN:S2A-015#129:1:A>
Nobody responding that went out and Singapore gets the serve back

<ICE-SIN:S2A-015#130:1:A>
Singapore serving it up

<ICE-SIN:S2A-015#131:1:A>
Tan Ai Keng off the block

<ICE-SIN:S2A-015#132:1:A>
Philippines with the serve eleven thirteen

<ICE-SIN:S2A-015#133:1:A>
Oh Wee was the nearly made a mistake there

<ICE-SIN:S2A-015#134:1:A>
So Tan Ai Keng goes out

<ICE-SIN:S2A-015#135:1:A>
Ng Chee Ho takes his place

<ICE-SIN:S2A-015#136:1:A>
Chee Ho

<ICE-SIN:S2A-015#137:1:A>
Yes

<ICE-SIN:S2A-015#138:1:A>
Singapore really have to start doing something now

<ICE-SIN:S2A-015#139:1:A>
They're only ahead by one point

<ICE-SIN:S2A-015#140:1:A>
Thirteen twelve in the second game <unclear> word </unclear> for
setting it up and that was out

<ICE-SIN:S2A-015#141:1:A>
It deflected off one of Philippines player

<ICE-SIN:S2A-015#142:1:A>
The referee says and fourteen twelve then the score

<ICE-SIN:S2A-015#143:1:A>
Still right now that's one ahead away from winning the second game
to to put Singapore two love <unclear> word </unclear>

<ICE-SIN:S2A-015#144:1:A>
Nice deep serve and a nice powerful swipe from the Philippines <X>

<ICE-SIN:S2A-015#X145:1:A>
Ariel Delucrux <unclear> word </unclear> number nine going out
don't know who's coming in Oh Versulikal <unclear> word </unclear> Sulikal's

gonna put his whole weight behind that </X> </I>
