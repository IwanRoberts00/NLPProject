<ICE-SIN:S2A-006#1:1:A>
They have no marks on the ground by which to give themselves
positions

<ICE-SIN:S2A-006#2:1:A>
It's all done with tremendous timing a great deal of dedication

<ICE-SIN:S2A-006#3:1:A>
We'll have a beautiful beautiful here at the National Stadium

<ICE-SIN:S2A-006#4:1:A>
We are live at the closing ceremony and this first item spring to
cohesion the mass display by the combined schools' bands

<ICE-SIN:S2A-006#5:1:A>
There's another intricate pattern being weaved as the band also play

<ICE-SIN:S2A-006#6:1:A>
You can see the flash card display in the background

<ICE-SIN:S2A-006#7:1:A>
The flash cards being put together by over three and half thousand
students three and a half thousand books and we see the same number of flash
lights just a couple of moments

<ICE-SIN:S2A-006#8:1:A>
Another intricate pattern

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-006#9:1:B>
And now the flash cards turning the focus onto the flag
twirlers

<ICE-SIN:S2A-006#10:1:B>
It's the turn of the band to play their supporting role

<ICE-SIN:S2A-006#11:1:B>
The view from the top

<ICE-SIN:S2A-006#12:1:B>
The flag twirlers providing texture and movement

<ICE-SIN:S2A-006#13:1:B>
A rippling display there from four hundred girls from Raffles and
Saint Nicholas schools

<ICE-SIN:S2A-006#14:1:B>
A glitter of their best gleaming of the lights and <unclear> word
</unclear> matching the polished gleam of the brass instruments

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-006#15:1:A>
This matching in the left side there you can see the Provos
Unit which I'm sure will incite in just a couple of moments

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-006#16:1:B>
The spotlight now on the Singapore Armed Forces Provos Unit

<ICE-SIN:S2A-006#17:1:B>
We saw them at the opening in their ceremonial wear this time
they're topped up in something a little more festive in keeping with this
mood of celebration

<ICE-SIN:S2A-006#18:1:B>
And without giving the game away let me tell you they've got quite
a few tricks up their sleeves

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-006#19:1:A>
That's for certain

<ICE-SIN:S2A-006#20:1:A>
We've watched them a few times now and this is impressive drill

<ICE-SIN:S2A-006#21:1:A>
See the great screen in the background that is one of the

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-006#22:1:B>
I think he was pre-empt

<ICE-SIN:S2A-006#23:1:B>
And screams the cheers there from the crowds here

<ICE-SIN:S2A-006#24:1:B>
This is the first time that fireworks being incorporated into the
precision drill and you can see the flash card there highlighting that fact

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-006#25:1:A>
Performers meet in the centre of the hitch and now the Provos
also there

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-006#26:1:B>
Perfect dressing on the field and on stage

<ICE-SIN:S2A-006#27:1:B>
Ten on stage ninety-six on the field making the Provos Unit here
tonight a hundred and six strong

<ICE-SIN:S2A-006#28:1:B>
Consider yourself one of the family and the men can certainly do
that heading now the performance here with the band and flag twirlers playing
supporting roles

<ICE-SIN:S2A-006#29:1:B>
Another family there with six founder nations of the South-East
Asia Games

<ICE-SIN:S2A-006#30:1:B>
Six circles on the six on the flag of South-East Asia logo

<ICE-SIN:S2A-006#31:1:B>
Another burst of fireworks there and it takes a tremendous amount
of concentration for these men to not let the fireworks distract them from
their precision drill

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-006#32:1:A>
These are cold fireworks <unclear> word </unclear>

<ICE-SIN:S2A-006#33:1:A>
As the smoke drifts away across the field

<ICE-SIN:S2A-006#34:1:A>
These young people really enjoying themselves this evening

<ICE-SIN:S2A-006#35:1:A>
They've practised so long and hard

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-006#36:1:B>
Look at the way they toss their weapons

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-006#37:1:A>
I think that's the Reminston <unclear> word </unclear>

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-006#38:1:B>
That's right

<ICE-SIN:S2A-006#39:1:B>
They weigh a <unclear> word </unclear> hefty five kilograms each

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-006#40:1:A>
Well I think he's quite relief because our camera was quickly
<unclear> word </unclear> very close there and another one

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-006#41:1:B>
You see this exchange of arms symbolising the exchange of
greetings and goodwill amongst the participating countries

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-006#42:1:A>
The Provos there high-lit again on the flash cards Now we're
looking at something sensational

<ICE-SIN:S2A-006#43:1:A>
Keep your eyes glued to the Provos lines

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-006#44:1:B>
And look at that

<ICE-SIN:S2A-006#45:1:B>
A truly sterling performance as the men kneel and toss the weapon
catching them as they stand which is perfect coordination there

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-006#46:1:A>
The crowd loved it

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-006#47:1:B>

Change of beat there Labamba and the flash cards giving way to
flashlights unison in colours and now we see all three elements in this
display moving together

<ICE-SIN:S2A-006#50:1:B>
Special credit for the choreography goes to Gwee Boon Huat for the
band members

Mister Lim Ah Leck there now adding to the band's repertoire of pop
and marching classics a local flavour Geylang Sepatu Geylang

<ICE-SIN:S2A-006#54:1:A>
A lot more to come I tell you as well

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-006#55:1:B>

This flurry of activity on the centre stage now as the lion of the
seventh SEA game's logo take shape

Absolutely the president really enjoy that which we M C Rafael

changes to the sporting theme

<ICE-SIN:S2A-006#68:1:A>
But that really was a stunning display of precision marching and
great discipline as we have the marching in of the tableau two hundred and
eighty men from the seventy-first intake of Police national servicemen under
their instructor Staff Sergeant Lee Chye Huat going four pieces of banner

<ICE-SIN:S2A-006#69:1:A>

Emotional motions as the flag is lowered

<ICE-SIN:S2A-006#103:1:A>
The theme created by Major Tonni Wei takes exactly sixty seconds
that length of time for the flag to come down from its high position into the
waiting arms of Singapore's eight gold medal heros of the ninety-three games

<ICE-SIN:S2A-006#104:1:A>

Let there be peace on earth as the flame just awhile will be
extinguished and the emotion there's no question is being tested

<ICE-SIN:S2A-006#111:1:A>
A wonderful wonderful mind there is

<ICE-SIN:S2A-006#112:1:A>

the flame

rings representing the six South-East Asian games countries who've involved
in the games when they first began

<ICE-SIN:S2A-006#116:1:A>
The SEA Games Federation was first set up the logo that was
designed by <unclear> word </unclear> paraded proudly as once again the flame
losing its intensity not only in the coven here but also in the flash cards
as well

<ICE-SIN:S2A-006#117:1:A>
And the choir singing Let there be peace on earth and let me tell
you that has been really the most important thing about these seventh SEA
Games

<ICE-SIN:S2A-006#118:1:A>
They have been wonderfully friendly and we hope that when we meet
again two years in Changmai then we can renew our friendship

<ICE-SIN:S2A-006#119:1:A>
The flame is extinguished the flag has gone out of the arena and
we wipe away a tear

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-006#120:1:B>
On stage now preparations are going on to hand over the SEA
Games colours to Thailand the next host of the eighteenth SouthEast Asia

<ICE-SIN:S2A-006#125:1:B>
You can see

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-006#126:1:A>
Well who are these little friends

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-006#127:1:B>
On stage now two cats Singa we can all recognise and I
believe that is the new mascot for the eighteenth SEA Games his name Sawadi

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-006#128:1:A>
Sawadi hello

<ICE-SIN:S2A-006#129:1:A>
Well if that's not a Siamese cat I don't what it is

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-006#130:1:B>
Sawadi there a little bit shy at the moment I think

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-006#131:1:A>
Singa still centre stage and enjoying himself

<ICE-SIN:S2A-006#132:1:A>
Well certainly the rhythm has changed

<ICE-SIN:S2A-006#133:1:A>
It's definitely Thai

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-006#134:1:B>
Ah nice close up there Sawadi

<ICE-SIN:S2A-006#135:1:B>
He does look rather shy actually

<ICE-SIN:S2A-006#136:1:B>
Sawadi of course is the multi-layered Thai greeting it can mean
anything from hello good morning good afternoon

<ICE-SIN:S2A-006#137:1:B>
So remember it if you're going to Thailand in two years' time for
the eighteenth South-East Asia Games

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-006#138:1:A>
So with the departure of Singa Sadawi we're now going to
showcase Thailand

<ICE-SIN:S2A-006#139:1:A>
Thai item coming up very shortly as the host country

<ICE-SIN:S2A-006#140:1:A>
This item we haven't actually seen <unclear> word </unclear>

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-006#141:1:B>
Loy Kratong now fills the stadium the music of Thailand

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-006#142:1:A>
And it's not just flash bulbs going off from the background
the torches and the uh the closing kit are certainly proving very popular

<ICE-SIN:S2A-006#143:1:A>
And that facet

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-006#144:1:B>
City hall

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-006#145:1:A>
is really interesting

<ICE-SIN:S2A-006#146:1:A>
Yes

<ICE-SIN:S2A-006#147:1:A>
Right

<ICE-SIN:S2A-006#148:1:A>
It dissolves into a Thai item entitled Savakchaiak drums
Savakchaiak drum part of the <unclear> word </unclear> Thai among the Thai
village of Thais time performed to either proclaim a military victory by a
king or during martial combat <X>

<ICE-SIN:S2A-006#X149:1:A>
And the beating of the large drum required much virtuosity using
several parts of the drum including wood frame to create a variety of sounds
And we have a medium-fast beat at the moment a slow beat and a very very
quick beat which I'm sure we'll see before the end of this item This
performance is very popular but it's only in fact seen in Northern Thailand
usually at the head of parades Chiangmai of course is the northern island
</X> </I>
