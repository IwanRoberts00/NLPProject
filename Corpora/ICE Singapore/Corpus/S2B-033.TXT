Sight many of us take it for granted until something happens

<ICE-SIN:S2B-033#2:1:A>
What Balachanda didn't know was that he had developed carytic conus
a condition where his cornea had become uneven

<ICE-SIN:S2B-033#3:1:A>
Balachanda is just one of fifty people every year who are afflicted
with cornea disease

<ICE-SIN:S2B-033#4:1:A>
The cornea is a transparent skin covering the eye

<ICE-SIN:S2B-033#5:1:A>
When it's diseased vision is blocked

<ICE-SIN:S2B-033#6:1:A>
The only hope is a transplant where the old cornea is removed and
replaced by a new cornea

<ICE-SIN:S2B-033#7:1:A>
It is a simple operation but difficult to perform simply because of
a lack of donor corneas

<ICE-SIN:S2B-033#8:1:A>
Because of the shortage Balachanda had to get by the first year on
special contact lenses instead

<ICE-SIN:S2B-033#9:1:A>
Each pair cost him seven hundred dollars

<ICE-SIN:S2B-033#10:1:A>
Finally last June nearly two and a half years after his problem
began Balachanda received the call to say that a donor cornea was available

<ICE-SIN:S2B-033#11:1:A>
He had the operation the very next day and today relies on that eye
which now has almost perfect vision

<ICE-SIN:S2B-033#12:1:A>
But his problem isn't totally over because only one eye is clear he
has problem balancing his vision in both eyes

<ICE-SIN:S2B-033#13:1:A>
He now hopes that the same operation can be carried out again this
time to correct the other eye

<ICE-SIN:S2B-033#14:1:A>
And Bala isn't the only one Every year over a hundred and fifty
people are on a waiting list for the operation

<ICE-SIN:S2B-033#15:1:A>
The actual number is even higher if you take into account those
waiting at private hospitals

<ICE-SIN:S2B-033#16:1:A>
Doctors say we need to triple our present number of donors in order
to meet our needs

<ICE-SIN:S2B-033#17:1:A>
At the moment most of the corneas available are imported

<ICE-SIN:S2B-033#18:1:A>
Each week the Singapore National Eye Centre places an order for two
donor corneas from Sri Lanka Since nineteen sixty-four Singapore has received
between three and four hundred corneas from the country the world's largest
cornea donor

<ICE-SIN:S2B-033#19:1:A>
It is six am and a cornea ordered last week has just arrived from
Sri Lanka

<ICE-SIN:S2B-033#20:1:A>
It comes packed in a special fluid which can preserve it for up to
five days

<ICE-SIN:S2B-033#21:1:A>
By the time it arrives it is at least two days old and things have
to move fast to avoid any more delay

<ICE-SIN:S2B-033#22:1:A>
By nine am the eye is collected and rushed to the hospital

<ICE-SIN:S2B-033#23:1:A>
There it's carefully store in the freezer at below four degrees

<ICE-SIN:S2B-033#24:1:A>
Four hours later tests are done on the eye

<ICE-SIN:S2B-033#25:1:A>
By the next morning the operation is underway

<ICE-SIN:S2B-033#26:1:A>
The lucky recipient is a seventy year old man who's already blind
in one eye The operation is to try save the other

<ICE-SIN:S2B-033#27:1:A>
During the operation the donor cornea is measured and cut to size
Within the hour it is sown on

<ICE-SIN:S2B-033#28:1:A>
This operation is the only hope for the patient

<ICE-SIN:S2B-033#29:1:A>
If successful it could mean restoring vision to the eye He has
waited over six months for this operation

<ICE-SIN:S2B-033#30:1:A>
Getting a healthy cornea is difficult In fact sometimes corneas are
rejected on arrival

<ICE-SIN:S2B-033#31:1:A>
In some cases the quality was in doubt but used anyway because the
patient could not afford to wait any longer

<ICE-SIN:S2B-033#32:1:A>
Last year the Singapore General Hospital stop using corneas from
Sri Lanka for a period of time for fear of aids and hepatitis infection

<ICE-SIN:S2B-033#33:1:A>
Doctors told us that the best solution would be to use local
corneas

<ICE-SIN:S2B-033#34:1:A>
This way there'll be greater control over their quality </I>

Good local fare is usually found only at hawker centres

<ICE-SIN:S2B-033#36:2:B>
Probably the most popular among locals and tourists alike is the
Newton food centre

<ICE-SIN:S2B-033#37:2:B>
Open twenty-four hours a day Newton is famous for its good food and
ambience

<ICE-SIN:S2B-033#38:2:B>
But until recently the eating place was also notorious for some of
Singapore's most aggressive store holders

<ICE-SIN:S2B-033#39:2:B>
Their strong arm tactics ended when two previous stall tenants had
their operating licences revoked for over-charging and harassing customers

<ICE-SIN:S2B-033#40:2:B>
Bidding for the vacant stores quickly took place and the results
raised eye-brows throughout Singapore

<ICE-SIN:S2B-033#41:2:B>
While the monthly rental at Newton once averaged two hundred
dollars stall number fifty-six's new tenant bid a whopping fifteen thousand
five hundred dollars

<ICE-SIN:S2B-033#42:2:B>
The successful bid for stall number sixty amounted to ten thousand
one hundred and sixty-eight dollars Many existing Newton stall holders don't
believe the new tenants can survive

<ICE-SIN:S2B-033#43:2:B>
Insiders say some stores can earn up to three thousand dollars a
day as Newton remain possibly the best location for hawkers

<ICE-SIN:S2B-033#44:2:B>
And the high-roller bidders with their big-time bets are gambling
on that knowledge

<ICE-SIN:S2B-033#45:2:B>
One of them is the owner of a well-known roast duck chain of eight
outlets located throughout Singapore

<ICE-SIN:S2B-033#46:2:B>
He is Johnson Lock and his is a rag-to-riches story

<ICE-SIN:S2B-033#47:2:B>
Lock who started at fourteen as a kitchen helper earning two
dollars a day was promoted to an assistant cook before compulsory stint in
the army

<ICE-SIN:S2B-033#48:2:B>
After that he gave cooking lessons at a community centre

<ICE-SIN:S2B-033#49:2:B>
He then ventured into the chicken-rice business but somehow
figured out that there was more money in roasted ducks

<ICE-SIN:S2B-033#50:2:B>
While its competitors then sold each duck for twenty to thirty
dollars he shrewdly slashed the price to thirteen dollars a duck

<ICE-SIN:S2B-033#51:2:B>
Thirteen dollars a duck was and still is possible because Lock
doesn't need to go through a middleman

<ICE-SIN:S2B-033#52:2:B>
He owns a factory that supplies roasted ducks directly to his
outlets While competitors charge seasonal prices Lock's price is fixed at
thirteen dollars a duck

<ICE-SIN:S2B-033#53:2:B>
His no nonsense pricing has allowed business volume to grow
dramatically

<ICE-SIN:S2B-033#54:2:B>
Today he sells about thirty thousand ducks a month

<ICE-SIN:S2B-033#55:2:B>
Lock is confident that his Newton stall rent of ten thousand one
hundred and sixty-eight dollars will be covered

<ICE-SIN:S2B-033#56:2:B>
At thirteen dollars a duck he would need to sell only forty ducks a
day to break even

<ICE-SIN:S2B-033#57:2:B>
But Lock is confident that the crowd at Newton will be able to
bring him profits

<ICE-SIN:S2B-033#58:2:B>
By one estimate if Lock does manage to sell two hundred ducks a day
just at Newton he could gross around two thousand six hundred dollars a day
or about eighty thousand dollars a month

<ICE-SIN:S2B-033#59:2:B>
His rental would then be more than well covered

<ICE-SIN:S2B-033#60:2:B>
So rental doesn't seem to be the major issue in Johnson Lock's
business

<ICE-SIN:S2B-033#61:2:B>
Rather his main problem which all hawkers are facing is the
shortage of labour

<ICE-SIN:S2B-033#62:2:B>
Although he pays his workers a minimum of one thousand two hundred
dollars a month plus yearly bonuses for a six day week finding helpers has
proven difficult

<ICE-SIN:S2B-033#63:2:B>
Opening the Newton stall may mean closing down one of his other
outlets to reallocate his work force

<ICE-SIN:S2B-033#64:2:B>
The shortage of labour in Singapore limits Lock's expansion plans
here so he's looking at Malaysia for the future

<ICE-SIN:S2B-033#65:2:B>
But in the meanwhile Lock is looking forward to the opening of his
new store at Newton on the second of March

<ICE-SIN:S2B-033#66:2:B>
Whether he makes money there remains to be seen but the ambition
and determination driving him there's a good chance he will succeed </I>

<ICE-SIN:S2B-033#67:3:C>
Our growth in 1986 is a small 19 per cent

<ICE-SIN:S2B-033#68:3:C>
Half the economy manufacturing transport and communications - has
done well

<ICE-SIN:S2B-033#69:3:C>
The other half commerce financial and business services and
construction remains depressed

<ICE-SIN:S2B-033#70:3:C>
The economy is recovering because we took decisive measures to
tackle our economic problems directly

<ICE-SIN:S2B-033#71:3:C>
We reduced business costs including cutting taxes and employers'
CPF contributions and restrained wage increases

<ICE-SIN:S2B-033#72:3:C>
Our workers and trade unions have supported these actions

<ICE-SIN:S2B-033#73:3:C>
By not flinching from painful policies Singaporeans have spared
themselves higher inflation and a longer recession

<ICE-SIN:S2B-033#74:3:C>
The soft option would have been for no reduction in employers' CPF
contributions no wage restraint minor cost-cutting

<ICE-SIN:S2B-033#75:3:C>
Instead we would have had to accept a drop in the exchange rate of
the Singapore dollar as the economy continued to weaken and the foreign
exchange markets pushed the Singapore dollar down

<ICE-SIN:S2B-033#76:3:C>
The drop would have needed to be sizable to achieve the equivalent
of a 15 per cent reduction in employers' CPF contributions

<ICE-SIN:S2B-033#77:3:C>
This would have led to a high inflation rate of more than 10 per
cent because Singapore imports its food oil nearly all manufactured and
semi-manufactured products

<ICE-SIN:S2B-033#78:3:C>
Then workers' pay and CPF would have appeared the same or even more
but would have been worth less in purchasing power

<ICE-SIN:S2B-033#79:3:C>
Instead our inflation rate was less than zero: - 14 per cent that
is each Singapore dollar bought slightly more in 1986 than in 1985

<ICE-SIN:S2B-033#80:3:C>
By dealing with the problem head on we have simplified and
shortened the process of adjusting our economy and have avoided inflation

<ICE-SIN:S2B-033#81:3:C>
External factors like the appreciation of the Yen have helped

<ICE-SIN:S2B-033#82:3:C>
But we would have not been able to take advantage of these
favourable developments if we had not set our house in order

<ICE-SIN:S2B-033#83:3:C>
If Singapore had not become more competitive Japanese companies
looking for an external location because of a higher Yen would have skipped
Singapore

<ICE-SIN:S2B-033#84:3:C>
The forecast for the region is continued low commodity prices and
therefore continued slow growth

<ICE-SIN:S2B-033#85:3:C>
Those sectors of the Singapore economy that are linked to the
region will not perform well

<ICE-SIN:S2B-033#86:3:C>
Our growth rate in 1987 is expected to be only 3-4 per cent

<ICE-SIN:S2B-033#87:3:C>
This is not only less than the 6-8 per cent projected for the other
newly industrialising Countries NICs it is also below our own estimated
long-term growth rate of 4-6 per cent

<ICE-SIN:S2B-033#88:3:C>
It shows that our recovery is not complete

<ICE-SIN:S2B-033#89:3:C>
Ministry of Trade & Industry MTI calculations show that although we
have improved in competitiveness against the other NICs we have not fully
recovered the competitiveness we enjoyed against them before our high wage
increases in 1980-83

<ICE-SIN:S2B-033#90:3:C>
We need at least one more year of high productivity growth and wage
restraint to close the gap

<ICE-SIN:S2B-033#91:3:C>
If their wages go up this year whilst we stay put the gap will
narrow

<ICE-SIN:S2B-033#92:3:C>
At the same time we must press on with reforming our wage payment
system

<ICE-SIN:S2B-033#93:3:C>
In a next recession and there will inevitably be a next one we are
unlikely to have large employers' CPF contributions to cut back

<ICE-SIN:S2B-033#94:3:C>
At present we have in-built rigidities in our wage structure

<ICE-SIN:S2B-033#95:3:C>
The NWC has endorsed its Subcommittee Report on Wage Reform

<ICE-SIN:S2B-033#96:3:C>
Twenty-three large local companies and MNCs as well as the banking
and insurance groups are already discussing these ideas with their unions

<ICE-SIN:S2B-033#97:3:C>
Companies who have not started should do so

<ICE-SIN:S2B-033#98:3:C>
The objectives are to build flexibility into our wage system and to
link workers' rewards to <&>  a </&> productivity growth <&>  b </&> performance of the
firm and <&>  c </&> performance of the individual

<ICE-SIN:S2B-033#99:3:C>
Flexibility will increase the survival capacity of companies

<ICE-SIN:S2B-033#100:3:C>
It is a safety margin for workers so that they can keep their jobs
when companies fare poorly

<ICE-SIN:S2B-033#101:3:C>
If they do this in a next recession management can reduce costs
rather than output by cutting the flexible component of wages

<ICE-SIN:S2B-033#102:3:C>
So we can recover from the recession more quickly with fewer
workers retrenched

<ICE-SIN:S2B-033#103:3:C>
My younger colleagues have diagnosed our economic problems

<ICE-SIN:S2B-033#104:3:C>
They decided on cost-cutting and wage restraint to attract new
investments and to create a favourable climate for a total business centre

<ICE-SIN:S2B-033#105:3:C>
Union leaders have persuaded and convinced the workers to back
this strategy And our economy is on the mend

<ICE-SIN:S2B-033#106:3:C>
But the more difficult part will come next year

<ICE-SIN:S2B-033#107:3:C>
Although MTI forecasts 3-4 per cent growth commerce financial and
business services and construction are not expected to rebound and growth
will have to come from manufacturing and transport & communications

<ICE-SIN:S2B-033#108:3:C>
To reach a figure of four per cent for the economy as a whole
these two sectors manufacturing and transport and communications will have to
grow by eight per cent a high target achievable only if we keep costs down
and productivity up

<ICE-SIN:S2B-033#109:3:C>
Therefore to improve the overall performance of the economy
manufacturing and transport and communications workers will have to moderate
their wage expectations

<ICE-SIN:S2B-033#110:3:C>
Workers will feel the pick up by early 1987 when the NWC will be
considering the 1987 recommendations

<ICE-SIN:S2B-033#111:3:C>
Factories will work more overtime and hire more workers

<ICE-SIN:S2B-033#112:3:C>
Workers will read of better profits in company reports the result
of last year's cost-cutting

<ICE-SIN:S2B-033#113:3:C>
They will be tempted to heed the good news and to press for a wage
increase

<ICE-SIN:S2B-033#114:3:C>
With output training if employers in the manufacturing sector
relent and become overgenerous they will become the pace setter <X>

<ICE-SIN:S2B-033#X115:3:C>
Then wages in other sectors will be forced to follow suit
regardless of their ability to pay

<ICE-SIN:S2B-033#X116:3:C>
If this happen our entire strategy for economic recovery will be
jeopardized The test for our younger generation of Singaporean leaders and
workers is whether they can put long-term interests ahead of short-term gains
and by demonstrating wage-restraint discipline win the confidence of
investors I wish you all a Happy New Year </X> </I>
