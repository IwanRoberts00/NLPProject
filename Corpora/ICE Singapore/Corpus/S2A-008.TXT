<I>

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-008#1:1:A>
But the but Singapore are still facing the same situation here

<ICE-SIN:S2A-008#2:1:A>
They're down by a goal to nil against Kuala Lumpur but they have a
chance to redeem themselves

<ICE-SIN:S2A-008#3:1:A>
Haslim

<ICE-SIN:S2A-008#4:1:A>
A good shot by Haslim and it just sailed over the bar and that
believe it or not is uh Singapore's first attempted goal

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-008#5:1:B>
First good attempt

<ICE-SIN:S2A-008#6:1:B>
Haslim had run earlier

<ICE-SIN:S2A-008#7:1:B>
He shot wide and very feebly

<ICE-SIN:S2A-008#8:1:B>
The only encouraging sign like I said is Singapore are putting a lot
of pressure on the Kuala Lumpur players

<ICE-SIN:S2A-008#9:1:B>
They look dangerous

<ICE-SIN:S2A-008#10:1:B>
Only from a couple of long shots and the goal came about as a
result of Pathanathan's mistake when he actually played the ball into the
path

<ICE-SIN:S2A-008#11:1:B>
Anton Bravo allowing him to run at the Singapore defence

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-008#12:1:A>
Once again some good play by Kuala Lumpur and this is the
defender coming up to join the attack

<ICE-SIN:S2A-008#13:1:A>
So Kuala Lumpur is still hanging on to that one goal lead against
Singapore scored in the nineteenth minute from Azman Adnan

<ICE-SIN:S2A-008#14:1:A>
And the big question that was raised before this match

<ICE-SIN:S2A-008#15:1:A>
Will Singapore miss Michael Varna

<ICE-SIN:S2A-008#16:1:A>
Well at the moment I have to say yes because there's no forward no
mid-fielder who's runnning at the Kuala Lumpur defenders at the moment

<ICE-SIN:S2A-008#17:1:A>
Good cross by Abdullah Bohan on the run but a good catch by V
Muruggan who seems to be very confident coming out of his box collecting
these crosses

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-008#18:1:B>
He is a good goalie

<ICE-SIN:S2A-008#19:1:B>
He had his critics say a couple of seasons ago but ever since then
he's just grown from strength to strength

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-008#20:1:A>
Nazri Latiff Abdullah

<ICE-SIN:S2A-008#21:1:A>
We haven't seen much of Latiff and his uh hard runs and we see him
losing the ball again

<ICE-SIN:S2A-008#22:1:A>
Singapore defenders a little bit slow to shoot this down

<ICE-SIN:S2A-008#23:1:A>
Oh good tackle

<ICE-SIN:S2A-008#24:1:A>
Fantastic last minute saving tackle by Noor Haliz Shafik and Abdul
Malek must be panicking at the moment

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-008#25:1:B>
He must be wondering where his defence is

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-008#26:1:A>
Azman Adnan once again almost profiting from a defensive lapse
by a Singapore player

<ICE-SIN:S2A-008#27:1:A>
That time Latiff Abdullah who's come up to the near post to do his
defensive duties now

<ICE-SIN:S2A-008#28:1:A>
Five goals so far one in the F A M Cup

<ICE-SIN:S2A-008#29:1:A>
Azman Abdullah

<ICE-SIN:S2A-008#30:1:A>
Certainly a striker for the future for Kuala Lumpur and Malaysia of
course

<ICE-SIN:S2A-008#31:1:A>
Noor Haliz once again doing some appearing for Singapore and the
pressure from K Kannan the miss kick by Chai Siew Yai and it's a throw to for
Singapore

<ICE-SIN:S2A-008#32:1:A>
Haslim Nazri

<ICE-SIN:S2A-008#33:1:A>
Good ball by Nazri Nazir

<ICE-SIN:S2A-008#34:1:A>
Oh <unclear> word </unclear> just misjudged that ball

<ICE-SIN:S2A-008#35:1:A>
The ground is a little bit slip slippery I must state after a
downpour in the early part of the afternoon and the late stage late part of
the aft morning right here at the National Stadium

<ICE-SIN:S2A-008#36:1:A>
And so the pitch is a little bit slippery and soggy tonight and
that could only encourage uh Singapore team to take shot at goal which uh
sadly they're not doing at the moment

<ICE-SIN:S2A-008#37:1:A>
Abdullah Bohan Latiff

<ICE-SIN:S2A-008#38:1:A>
Abdullah back to uh Malek

<ICE-SIN:S2A-008#39:1:A>
Return by Malek Kawak

<ICE-SIN:S2A-008#40:1:A>
And Malek even finding it hard to control the ball on the track let
alone on the grass

<ICE-SIN:S2A-008#41:1:A>
It's all going wrong for the Singapore team at the moment

<ICE-SIN:S2A-008#42:1:A>
Good play by Nazri Nazir

<ICE-SIN:S2A-008#43:1:A>
Claimed that he was held back

<ICE-SIN:S2A-008#44:1:A>
But the referee thought otherwise and has given a throw in to Kuala
Lumpur

<ICE-SIN:S2A-008#45:1:A>
Nazri has uh had a good few good games for Singapore

<ICE-SIN:S2A-008#46:1:A>
Latiff Abdullah using his chest to put effects there but not a very
good ball by Malek Kawak almost putting uh Nazri Nazir into a very dangerous
situation where the Kuala Lumpur defender See Kim Savan

<ICE-SIN:S2A-008#47:1:A>
Amin Nasir Anton Bravo climbing and beating Malek Kawak easily

<ICE-SIN:S2A-008#48:1:A>
Kannan

<ICE-SIN:S2A-008#49:1:A>
Good play by K Kannan and definitely a foul

<ICE-SIN:S2A-008#50:1:A>
Zoran Nicholich the culprit then

<ICE-SIN:S2A-008#51:1:A>
But that's good close control by K Kannan and some encouraging
signs for the Singapore team

<ICE-SIN:S2A-008#52:1:A>
We've had twenty-seven minutes gone by

<ICE-SIN:S2A-008#53:1:A>
We had a goal and it's come from the tigers in red of Kuala Lumpur

<ICE-SIN:S2A-008#54:1:A>
Azman Adnan the hero at the moment

<ICE-SIN:S2A-008#55:1:A>
Malek chasing very hard for this one

<ICE-SIN:S2A-008#56:1:A>
Oh that's cool defending

<ICE-SIN:S2A-008#57:1:A>
Fantastic defender by Chai Siew Yeow

<ICE-SIN:S2A-008#58:1:A>
Wonderful play and uh Anton Bravo was misreading that for a little
while allowing it to go out ball

<ICE-SIN:S2A-008#59:1:A>
A throw in to Singapore

<ICE-SIN:S2A-008#60:1:A>
Not as many people coming here to watch tonight's match and at the
moment the rate the Singapore boys are going there might be even less in the
next match

<ICE-SIN:S2A-008#61:1:A>
Latiff Abdullah

<ICE-SIN:S2A-008#62:1:A>
Oh failing to control that and the Singapore team not only finding
it hard to string their passes together but they're also finding it difficult
to control the ball on this very slippery pitch

<ICE-SIN:S2A-008#63:1:A>
Anton Bravo

<ICE-SIN:S2A-008#64:1:A>
Now that's good ball control

<ICE-SIN:S2A-008#65:1:A>
Sharom Abdul Majid coming in from the blind side almost catching
Papanathan and he was very confident that his custodian would get to the ball
which he did and here is Noor Haliz Shafik

<ICE-SIN:S2A-008#66:1:A>
Nazri coming down deep to collect and fetch and carry

<ICE-SIN:S2A-008#67:1:A>
Abdullah Mohan

<ICE-SIN:S2A-008#68:1:A>
Good header to Haslim

<ICE-SIN:S2A-008#69:1:A>
Faced with uh Rajid Ismail

<ICE-SIN:S2A-008#70:1:A>
Good ball inside for Malek

<ICE-SIN:S2A-008#71:1:A>
A lovely ball for Kannan

<ICE-SIN:S2A-008#72:1:A>
Will interception go

<ICE-SIN:S2A-008#73:1:A>
Danger's not over yet for Kuala Lumpur

<ICE-SIN:S2A-008#74:1:A>
Here's comes K Kunalan faced with K Kunalan

<ICE-SIN:S2A-008#75:1:A>
Oh good play by Kannan

<ICE-SIN:S2A-008#76:1:A>
Got past Kunalan so very easily but Kunalan did enough to push him
away for the ball

<ICE-SIN:S2A-008#77:1:A>
Latiff not the biggest of players but got got up so well for that
one

<ICE-SIN:S2A-008#78:1:A>
Here is Nazri

<ICE-SIN:S2A-008#79:1:A>
Nazri trying to do a little too much

<ICE-SIN:S2A-008#80:1:A>
Abdullah Mohan

<ICE-SIN:S2A-008#81:1:A>
Can he keep it in play

<ICE-SIN:S2A-008#82:1:A>
Yes he can

<ICE-SIN:S2A-008#83:1:A>
Now what kind of cross is he gonna give

<ICE-SIN:S2A-008#84:1:A>
A good one going past every player except to Malek Kawak

<ICE-SIN:S2A-008#85:1:A>
Singapore boys enjoying some pressure until that poor ball

<ICE-SIN:S2A-008#86:1:A>
In fact poor play Malek Kawak allowing Zoran Nicholich to to free

<ICE-SIN:S2A-008#87:1:A>
Azman Adnan

<ICE-SIN:S2A-008#88:1:A>
Danger for Singapore once again

<ICE-SIN:S2A-008#89:1:A>
Azman interest wide

<ICE-SIN:S2A-008#90:1:A>
In fact I think Abdul Malik got a good fingertip at the ball to
divert it out for a corner to Kuala Lumpur

<ICE-SIN:S2A-008#91:1:A>
It could have been two nil so very easily and once again from the
mistake by a Singapore mid-fielder

<ICE-SIN:S2A-008#92:1:A>
A lapse of concentration this time in the Kuala Lumpur half and it
just takes one pass from Zuran Nicholich to uh give the strikers some rule to
run at the Singapore defenders

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-008#93:1:B>
That's the mark of the great player

<ICE-SIN:S2A-008#94:1:B>
He saw what Malek was going to do

<ICE-SIN:S2A-008#95:1:B>
Robbed him and set up the attack

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-008#96:1:A>
Papanathan cleared the danger for a little while

<ICE-SIN:S2A-008#97:1:A>
But it's not over yet

<ICE-SIN:S2A-008#98:1:A>
Nicholich Grabo

<ICE-SIN:S2A-008#99:1:A>
The two co-eds linking up together and uh Latiff bounced off the
tree top

<ICE-SIN:S2A-008#100:1:A>
Latiff Abdullah although he would claim that he played a one two
then

<ICE-SIN:S2A-008#101:1:A>
Ball back to Papanathan

<ICE-SIN:S2A-008#102:1:A>
Then to Kannan easing up some pressure now from the Singapore side

<ICE-SIN:S2A-008#103:1:A>
Devaraj

<ICE-SIN:S2A-008#104:1:A>
Good control by Deveraj

<ICE-SIN:S2A-008#105:1:A>
Then to Nazri

<ICE-SIN:S2A-008#106:1:A>
Nazri with a good ball out to Abdullah Bohan

<ICE-SIN:S2A-008#107:1:A>
Abdullah has got a defender to beat and Abdullah is uh showing
some poor ball control on this right flank

<ICE-SIN:S2A-008#108:1:A>
Bertrand

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-008#109:1:B>
That his is problem actually

<ICE-SIN:S2A-008#110:1:B>
He is a very tough hard uncompromising player but his control does
leave a little bit more to be desired at this level

<ICE-SIN:S2A-008#111:1:B>
Shariff Mohammud out jumped by Noor Halis

<ICE-SIN:S2A-008#112:1:B>
Anton down with an injury at the moment

<ICE-SIN:S2A-008#113:1:B>
Been half an hour gone by

<ICE-SIN:S2A-008#114:1:B>
In fact my watch says thirty-two minutes gone by

<ICE-SIN:S2A-008#115:1:B>
Singapore haven't had a serious attempt at the Kuala Lumpur goal
yet and B Muruggan has had a a very a field day except for some crossing to
the penalty box which he gathered quite well

<ICE-SIN:S2A-008#116:1:B>
He's had an easy time with the Singapore strikes <unclear> word
</unclear>

<ICE-SIN:S2A-008#117:1:B>
Good ball Haslim Harun

<ICE-SIN:S2A-008#118:1:B>
And that's the danger posed by Latiff Abdullah

<ICE-SIN:S2A-008#119:1:B>
He's seem small

<ICE-SIN:S2A-008#120:1:B>
You cannot see him and you know when he comes from deep he just
beats the defenders and sometimes you can't he sneaks in from behind and uh
he sneaks in from behind and actually just uh grabs the ball from you when
you're attacking with without even knowing it

<ICE-SIN:S2A-008#121:1:B>
There he is Latiff Abdullah showing us that uh the throw ins are
definitely one of his fortes not one of his fortes

<ICE-SIN:S2A-008#122:1:B>
Doing a close marking job on Zorun Nicholich now

<ICE-SIN:S2A-008#123:1:B>
Gets away from Heiwich with some ease that Latiff worked so hard
to get it back

<ICE-SIN:S2A-008#124:1:B>
A good true ball splitting the Singapore defence once again

<ICE-SIN:S2A-008#125:1:B>
Sharin

<ICE-SIN:S2A-008#126:1:B>
Oh a misunderstanding then which could have proved uh fatal to the
Singapore team

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-008#127:1:B>
And Singapore were lucky there

<ICE-SIN:S2A-008#128:1:B>
The ball couldn't settle again

<ICE-SIN:S2A-008#129:1:B>
Run kindly for Sharin Abdullah

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-008#130:1:A>
So Latiff Abdullah in fact uh in fact uhm P N C Bargy have
decided to play a zonal marking system in mid-field to shut out uh Zoran
Nicholich but it hasn't worked so far

<ICE-SIN:S2A-008#131:1:A>
I think he's got to send a man on him

<ICE-SIN:S2A-008#132:1:A>
Latiff getting pass Anton Bravo with some luck but it cannot
continue forever and uh that pass of his went astray and C Bargy

<ICE-SIN:S2A-008#133:1:A>
Well a half-time talk and uh one replacement really sparked off a
much better display in the second half from the Singapore charges against
Johore the earlier match

<ICE-SIN:S2A-008#134:1:A>
It's preceding match but is he gonna be faced with a situation
like this again

<ICE-SIN:S2A-008#135:1:A>
He's not very happy at the moment Sanjay Ravi

<ICE-SIN:S2A-008#136:1:A>
I'm sure he'll be saying in his head that he would have stopped
that goal but he cannot fault Malek on his uh display tonight

<ICE-SIN:S2A-008#137:1:A>
Abdul Malek has been playing very very well for Singapore

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-008#138:1:B>
I bet he's the one who's keeping us in this game

<ICE-SIN:S2A-008#139:1:B>
He's had a couple of fingertip saves and by the post and he's tip
to over the ball

<ICE-SIN:S2A-008#140:1:B>
K L could easily be two or three up by now but for uhm Abdul Malek

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-008#141:1:A>
The Singapore mid-fielders are diminishing in this match at
the moment

<ICE-SIN:S2A-008#142:1:A>
They're almost disappearing

<ICE-SIN:S2A-008#143:1:A>
You cannot even see them controlling the ball in the middle of the
path

<ICE-SIN:S2A-008#144:1:A>
Outside Zaid Chamail or rather Rajid Ismail failed to keep the
ball in play

<ICE-SIN:S2A-008#145:1:A>
Good ball by Nazri to Haslim that Zuran fought so hard and got
back in time to shut out the danger pose by Singapore then

<ICE-SIN:S2A-008#146:1:A>
And as I was saying that certainly justified my claim that the
Singapore boys are not knocking with the ball around and they're finding it
more difficult to control the ball in this wet pitch than the Kuala Lumpur
team are

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-008#147:1:B>
The Kuala Lumpur team is playing it a lot more smarter by
playing either to the feet or if there's a wide open space

<ICE-SIN:S2A-008#148:1:B>
They're play into the space for the ball to run onto

<ICE-SIN:S2A-008#149:1:B>
The Singapore boys aren't doing that at the moment

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-008#150:1:A>
Nazri and the Singapore team

<ICE-SIN:S2A-008#151:1:A>
The players are actually having trouble with throw in as well

<ICE-SIN:S2A-008#152:1:A>
Kuala Lumpur have always done well right here at the National
Stadium

<ICE-SIN:S2A-008#153:1:A>
The only defeat uh so far in five years has been in nineteen
ninety when they lost to a quack Singapore squad which included Alistar
Edwards and Abbas Said then

<ICE-SIN:S2A-008#154:1:A>
They lost last year and uh uh they actually won last year

<ICE-SIN:S2A-008#155:1:A>
I beg your pardon

<ICE-SIN:S2A-008#156:1:A>
They won last year

<ICE-SIN:S2A-008#157:1:A>
They beat Singapore two one and this year at the moment they're
leading one nil

<ICE-SIN:S2A-008#158:1:A>
Malek

<ICE-SIN:S2A-008#159:1:A>
The fans urging the Singapore boys on the offensive

<ICE-SIN:S2A-008#160:1:A>
Devaraj to Latiff

<ICE-SIN:S2A-008#161:1:A>
Easy for M Murugan stopping the ball from going out for a corner
kick

<ICE-SIN:S2A-008#162:1:A>
The roar of uh thirty-six minutes gone by in this first half

<ICE-SIN:S2A-008#163:1:A>
The Singapore team have had nothing to show for and in fact it's
Kuala Lumpur who are orchestrating the better moves at the moment scoring a
goal as well as you can see from Azman Adnan in the nineteenth minute of play

<ICE-SIN:S2A-008#164:1:A>
Amin Nasir faced with Anton Bravo

<ICE-SIN:S2A-008#165:1:A>
Well I'm sure foul Amin then

<ICE-SIN:S2A-008#166:1:A>
A little bit of short tugging which the linesmen saw

<ICE-SIN:S2A-008#167:1:A>
Good observation by the linesmen

<ICE-SIN:S2A-008#168:1:A>
Haslim

<ICE-SIN:S2A-008#169:1:A>
We haven't seen much of Haslim and uh the form that he showed in
Perak

<ICE-SIN:S2A-008#170:1:A>
Well that's a good ball by Haslim Harun Nazri </I>
