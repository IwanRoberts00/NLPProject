<ICE-SIN:S2B-050#1:1> <X> ADDRESS BY MR LIM SOON HOCK, MANAGING DIRECTOR,
ASIA COMPAQ COMPUTER ASIA PTE LTD </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S2B-050#2:1:A>
Mr Pro-Chancellor Graduates Ladies and Gentlemen

<ICE-SIN:S2B-050#3:1:A>
It is a privilege for me to address you all today

<ICE-SIN:S2B-050#4:1:A>
Congratulations graduates

<ICE-SIN:S2B-050#5:1:A>
For many of you today marks the end of your academic careers and I'm
sure you have looked forward to this moment with great expectations

<ICE-SIN:S2B-050#6:1:A>
The degrees you collect today are recognition of what you have
accomplished through hard work perseverance and dedication

<ICE-SIN:S2B-050#7:1:A>
They will prove to the world that you are all trained engineers

<ICE-SIN:S2B-050#8:1:A>
They look backward at the life you have lead until today and praise
you for your accomplishments

<ICE-SIN:S2B-050#9:1:A>
But they represent something far more important

<ICE-SIN:S2B-050#10:1:A>
Something which looks ahead

<ICE-SIN:S2B-050#11:1:A>
They prove that you have learned how to learn

<ICE-SIN:S2B-050#12:1:A>
That in the final analysis is education's greatest gift

<ICE-SIN:S2B-050#13:1:A>
Because in the world outside the comfortable halls of academia it
is not what you know but rather what you are able to learn which will make
all the difference

<ICE-SIN:S2B-050#14:1:A>
What lies ahead of you all today is a world which is changing
faster and more profoundly than it ever has before

<ICE-SIN:S2B-050#15:1:A>
It is a world that just a few short years ago was unimaginable

<ICE-SIN:S2B-050#16:1:A>
Who could have imagined a united Germany

<ICE-SIN:S2B-050#17:1:A>
The fall of communism in country after country in Eastern Europe

<ICE-SIN:S2B-050#18:1:A>
Manned space travel being only page three news or the Soviet Union
looking to the United States and other countries for the financing necessary
to move toward a free market economy

<ICE-SIN:S2B-050#19:1:A>
So if the degrees you receive today are tickets for your journey
through this daunting and unpredictable landscape what advice can I lend to
help you on your way

<ICE-SIN:S2B-050#20:1:A>
I think I would start with a strange request

<ICE-SIN:S2B-050#21:1:A>
I would ask each and every one of you to be unreasonable

<ICE-SIN:S2B-050#22:1:A>
This must sound strange after you have spent so much time in these
halls learning the value of reason honing your skills to become reasoned
thinkers

<ICE-SIN:S2B-050#23:1:A>
And after countless requests from parents and teachers to just be
reasonable

<ICE-SIN:S2B-050#24:1:A>
Let me explain

<ICE-SIN:S2B-050#25:1:A>
George Bernard Shaw once said The reasonable man adapts himself to
the world; the unreasonable one persists in trying to adapt the world to
himself Therefore all progress depends on the unreasonable man

<ICE-SIN:S2B-050#26:1:A>
If Shaw had been writing today he undoubtedly would have said that
progress depends on the unreasonable man or woman and that raises another
point about changes in the world around us

<ICE-SIN:S2B-050#27:1:A>
Changing the world is no longer the province of just men

<ICE-SIN:S2B-050#28:1:A>
What was once patronisingly called the fairer sex has proven that
it is often also the smarter and more capable one

<ICE-SIN:S2B-050#29:1:A>
The proverbial battle of the sexes has broken free of the confines
of moonlit nights and candle-lit dinners

<ICE-SIN:S2B-050#30:1:A>
Now it is as frequently waged in boardrooms or from political
platforms

<ICE-SIN:S2B-050#31:1:A>
So why do I ask you men and women to be unreasonable

<ICE-SIN:S2B-050#32:1:A>
What do I mean by being unreasonable

<ICE-SIN:S2B-050#33:1:A>
If I place my request in its historical context perhaps it will
become clearer

<ICE-SIN:S2B-050#34:1:A>
The 19th century saw the rapid advancement of civilization first
start on a modern scale of pace reach and impact

<ICE-SIN:S2B-050#35:1:A>
It brought the industrial revolution great strides forward in
medicine and the ascendance of science as man's principal tool for unlocking
the mysteries of the world around him

<ICE-SIN:S2B-050#36:1:A>
It was called the Age of Reason

<ICE-SIN:S2B-050#37:1:A>
In the 20th century the world first took full advantage of all of
these new found tools of reason

<ICE-SIN:S2B-050#38:1:A>
The pace of change took a huge stride forward

<ICE-SIN:S2B-050#39:1:A>
Two world wars and the terrifying technology of nuclear weapons
created a bi-polar political structure which has brought relative stability
to world politics for the past 50 years

<ICE-SIN:S2B-050#40:1:A>
Man began the exploration of space

<ICE-SIN:S2B-050#41:1:A>
Information became instantly accessible around the globe

<ICE-SIN:S2B-050#42:1:A>
When Japan declared war against the United States it took two and a
half days for the declaration to be formally presented

<ICE-SIN:S2B-050#43:1:A>
I am told that George Bush informed Mikhail Gorbachev of the US
invasion of Kuwait within twenty minutes

<ICE-SIN:S2B-050#44:1:A>
And coverage of that war was seen live on televisions in London
living rooms and Sarawak longhouses simultaneously

<ICE-SIN:S2B-050#45:1:A>
We truly have become the products of the Information Age

<ICE-SIN:S2B-050#46:1:A>
This overwhelming abundance of and access to information will have
a major impact in further shaping the century to come

<ICE-SIN:S2B-050#47:1:A>
It will be a century which one London Business School professor has
dubbed The Age of Unreason

<ICE-SIN:S2B-050#48:1:A>
This is the century that you inherit the century you will help
shape

<ICE-SIN:S2B-050#49:1:A>
What will it be like

<ICE-SIN:S2B-050#50:1:A>
I'm sure my imagination could not do it credit but some parts of it
are clear

<ICE-SIN:S2B-050#51:1:A>
Technology will bring changes at a faster and faster rate

<ICE-SIN:S2B-050#52:1:A>
Traditional structures and processes of business and society will
be replaced over and over again

<ICE-SIN:S2B-050#53:1:A>
Within a decade it has been predicted that eighty percent of all
jobs in industrialised nations will call for mental rather than manual skills

<ICE-SIN:S2B-050#54:1:A>
That seems extremely encouraging for a group of new degree holders

<ICE-SIN:S2B-050#55:1:A>
But what mental skills will be needed

<ICE-SIN:S2B-050#56:1:A>
Hopefully many of those same skills which you have worked so hard
at learning during your years here at University

<ICE-SIN:S2B-050#57:1:A>
Education will have given you the tools you need to confront the
change which lies ahead

<ICE-SIN:S2B-050#58:1:A>
As graduates you represent the top 18% of all students in Singapore

<ICE-SIN:S2B-050#59:1:A>
But your specific training as engineers is only one part of what
you will need

<ICE-SIN:S2B-050#60:1:A>
Primary among the broader skills your education has given you will
be the ability to adapt and learn to master and in fact help shape change

<ICE-SIN:S2B-050#61:1:A>
That statement brings me back to my original premise about being
unreasonable

<ICE-SIN:S2B-050#62:1:A>
In this context then being unreasonable means not being content to
accept change but rather taking the initiative to shape it

<ICE-SIN:S2B-050#63:1:A>
As you enter the working world you become a part of the process of
change

<ICE-SIN:S2B-050#64:1:A>
More importantly the significance of the part you play is entirely
up to you

<ICE-SIN:S2B-050#65:1:A>
Einstein had three rules of work

<ICE-SIN:S2B-050#66:1:A>
One out of clutter find simplicity

<ICE-SIN:S2B-050#67:1:A>
Two from discord make harmony

<ICE-SIN:S2B-050#68:1:A>
Three in the middle of difficulty lies opportunity

<ICE-SIN:S2B-050#69:1:A>
These are simple rules from a very complex man

<ICE-SIN:S2B-050#70:1:A>
But it is important to note that these rules place the burden
squarely on the shoulders of the individual

<ICE-SIN:S2B-050#71:1:A>
It will be your job to find simplicity and make harmony

<ICE-SIN:S2B-050#72:1:A>
To rise above difficulty and take advantage of every opportunity

<ICE-SIN:S2B-050#73:1:A>
You must find it unreasonable to resist change to do it as it has
always been done

<ICE-SIN:S2B-050#74:1:A>
You must find it unreasonable to approach challenges with
conventional thought to play conventional roles to be content with the status
quo

<ICE-SIN:S2B-050#75:1:A>
Many of you, statistics show that as many as 20 to 30 per cent of
you may find your careers leading you away from your training in engineering

<ICE-SIN:S2B-050#76:1:A>
On the other hand many of you will prosper in your chosen field for
years to come

<ICE-SIN:S2B-050#77:1:A>
Either course is fine as long as you refuse to either hide behind
complacency or run from adversity

<ICE-SIN:S2B-050#78:1:A>
The changing future has equal need for the strength and discipline
of focused experts and the creativity and daring of entrepreneurs

<ICE-SIN:S2B-050#79:1:A>
The key is to continue to adapt the world around you on whatever
path you choose

<ICE-SIN:S2B-050#80:1:A>
In the past that world has been adapted by two forces more than any
others

<ICE-SIN:S2B-050#81:1:A>
Technology and economics each feeding on and spurring growth in the
other

<ICE-SIN:S2B-050#82:1:A>
The individuals who have made a difference have always understood
this link and exploited it to the fullest

<ICE-SIN:S2B-050#83:1:A>
Many of them started as engineers

<ICE-SIN:S2B-050#84:1:A>
It was reasonable to think that the telegraph transported
information quickly and effectively but not to Alexander Graham Bell

<ICE-SIN:S2B-050#85:1:A>
It was reasonable to be content with gas lighting but not to Thomas
Edison

<ICE-SIN:S2B-050#86:1:A>
It was reasonable to think that conventional manufacturing
techniques produced adequate amounts of goods but not to Henry Ford

<ICE-SIN:S2B-050#87:1:A>
The list is a familiar one

<ICE-SIN:S2B-050#88:1:A>
Individuals with vision and an unreasonable desire to reinvent the
world around themselves

<ICE-SIN:S2B-050#89:1:A>
So how do these well-known examples have relevance in today's
Singapore

<ICE-SIN:S2B-050#90:1:A>
Each of these unreasonable men changed their world

<ICE-SIN:S2B-050#91:1:A>
They combined technical engineering skills with vision to propel
their societies forward and their ideas helped spur enormous economic growth
in their countries

<ICE-SIN:S2B-050#92:1:A>
If we look at today's leading nations

<ICE-SIN:S2B-050#93:1:A>
Each built economic might on the back of technological excellence

<ICE-SIN:S2B-050#94:1:A>
The United States Germany Japan

<ICE-SIN:S2B-050#95:1:A>
Engineering and engineers with vision led the way

<ICE-SIN:S2B-050#96:1:A>
Today's Singapore provides unlimited opportunities for tomorrow's
Edisons Fords and Bells

<ICE-SIN:S2B-050#97:1:A>
Singapore has worked hard to provide an environment which is not
limited by its small geographic boundaries

<ICE-SIN:S2B-050#98:1:A>
Our country has succeeded in creating the landscape of a
technopolis with worldwide relevance

<ICE-SIN:S2B-050#99:1:A>
Foresight perseverance and hard work have given Singapore its much
envied infrastructure

<ICE-SIN:S2B-050#100:1:A>
The hard structures facilities and technologies needed to provide
for growth in the 20th century

<ICE-SIN:S2B-050#101:1:A>
Today's great global companies have recognised Singapore's
importance by establishing themselves here

<ICE-SIN:S2B-050#102:1:A>
You must match and indeed take advantage of their global vision

<ICE-SIN:S2B-050#103:1:A>
The opportunities for each and every one of you to expand both
your visionary and physical horizons are better than they have ever been
before

<ICE-SIN:S2B-050#104:1:A>
It is not unreasonable to think that any of you could find work in
one of the world's largest corporations

<ICE-SIN:S2B-050#105:1:A>
It is not unreasonable to think that the work you do for such a
company can effect and change the world for the better

<ICE-SIN:S2B-050#106:1:A>
It is not unreasonable to expect you to build the soft
infrastructure by which I mean the creativity innovativeness technical
expertise R&D know how financial acumen marketing prowess and managerial
talents which will be needed to continually attract investments into
Singapore as we grow into the 21st century

<ICE-SIN:S2B-050#107:1:A>
It may seem unreasonable however for me to make my next request

<ICE-SIN:S2B-050#108:1:A>
Currently only four Singapore companies are counted among the
worlds top 1,000

<ICE-SIN:S2B-050#109:1:A>
I put it to you that you can play a role in seeing that number
greatly increase during your lifetimes

<ICE-SIN:S2B-050#110:1:A>
Some among you may become entrepreneurs

<ICE-SIN:S2B-050#111:1:A>
It will take courage and perseverance to see your personal visions
grow and prosper

<ICE-SIN:S2B-050#112:1:A>
But you must always remember that growth and prosperity are only
limited by your ideas

<ICE-SIN:S2B-050#113:1:A>
By successfully combining your technical training with the
business skills which you will develop and hone in your professional careers
you can add to that list

<ICE-SIN:S2B-050#114:1:A>
With a global vision and the opportunities which Singapore's
technopolis holds out to you you can become masters of change

<ICE-SIN:S2B-050#115:1:A>
But does this mean you must master change alone

<ICE-SIN:S2B-050#116:1:A>
Does it mean you must discard everything from the past

<ICE-SIN:S2B-050#117:1:A>
Thankfully it does not

<ICE-SIN:S2B-050#118:1:A>
To face change and become its master you will need firm
foundations and anchors

<ICE-SIN:S2B-050#119:1:A>
Your parents the families you yourselves will start your school
your cultural traditions and the society around you

<ICE-SIN:S2B-050#120:1:A>
All will serve as your reservoirs of strength and continuity in
the changing world

<ICE-SIN:S2B-050#121:1:A>
But as much as these represent strength and support you will now
begin to see the responsibility they bring with them as well

<ICE-SIN:S2B-050#122:1:A>
Throughout your education you have been able to concentrate on
yourselves

<ICE-SIN:S2B-050#123:1:A>
Your test scores your performance and your growing abilities have
been your first priority

<ICE-SIN:S2B-050#124:1:A>
But today represents as much as anything the beginning of a shift
in that scale of priorities

<ICE-SIN:S2B-050#125:1:A>
Now begins the process of looking outward of giving back to those
people institutions and structures which have given so much to you

<ICE-SIN:S2B-050#126:1:A>
As you adapt the future never discard the past

<ICE-SIN:S2B-050#127:1:A>
Instead build on it

<ICE-SIN:S2B-050#128:1:A>
Keep up your ties with the University

<ICE-SIN:S2B-050#129:1:A>
I would urge you all to become active members of the Engineering
Alumni

<ICE-SIN:S2B-050#130:1:A>
Today you have been transformed from your status as students to
membership in a much broader fellowship that of graduates

<ICE-SIN:S2B-050#131:1:A>
As members of this fellowship you have new resources on which to
draw and new responsibilities to fulfil

<ICE-SIN:S2B-050#132:1:A>
If recent statements by our government are anything to go by the
Alumni will play a greater role in the future development of our University

<ICE-SIN:S2B-050#133:1:A>
That role is not merely limited to financial support

<ICE-SIN:S2B-050#134:1:A>
You can contribute by sharing your expertise and the new areas of
specialisation which you will find in the professional world with the
undergraduates graduates and fellow alumni

<ICE-SIN:S2B-050#135:1:A>
This type of shared fellowship can foster professionalism create
business opportunities and most importantly help the University to become a
richer and more lively environment for learning <X>

<ICE-SIN:S2B-050#X136:1:A>
Now you get to change the world It is your job to give shape and
meaning to the Age of Unreason Do it with a sense of expectation and
possibility Do it with enthusiasm Do it for both yourself and others and I am
confident you will do it well I think, all in all, that is a pretty
reasonable request </X> </I>
