CHAPTER I

<ICE-SIN:W2A-015#4:1>
<h> Introduction: Overview </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-015#5:1>
Psychiatry is that branch of medicine which deals with mental
disorders.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-015#6:1>
Forensic psychiatry is defined simply by John Gunn ( 1976) as the
application of general psychiatry to people who are in one way or another
involved in the legal process.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-015#7:1>
Slovenko ( 1980) observes that the major part of it is concerned with
the assessment of and opinion on individuals with respect to the question of
credibility, culpability, competency, compensation and custody.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-015#8:1>
The subspecialty of forensic psychiatry is more often than not
confined to the examination and management of the mentally abnormal
offenders.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-015#9:1>
Undeniably, mental disorders can result in aberrant behaviour which
comes into conflict with the law.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-015#10:1>
However that does not mean there is a direct link between crime in
general and psychiatric illness in general.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-015#11:1>
The mentally disordered person may commit a crime which has nothing
to do with his mental condition.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-015#12:1>
It is worth remembering that mental illness or mental disorder is a
biological concept.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-015#13:1>
Criminal behaviour however is a social concept determined by
legislation.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-015#14:1>
Even so the causation of crime is very complex.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-015#15:1>
It is the interaction between the individual's intelligence,
temperament and personality make up on the one hand and his sociocultural
background and life situation on the other.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-015#16:1>
<h> Conflict and Confusion </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-015#17:1>
Physical illnesses or diseases are better defined and understood
because there is generally a recognised etiology and a demonstrable
pathology.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-015#18:1>
Mental disorders on the other hand are the results of interactions
between biological, psychological and social factors.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-015#19:1>
Moreover the abnormal experience and behaviour produced are often
subject to individual interpretation and cultural beliefs.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-015#20:1>
The ordinary person has a very narrow concept of mental disorder.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-015#21:1>
To him mental disorder seems to mean only one thing and that is
madness.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-015#22:1>
Not surprisingly therefore conflict and confusion frequently arise
because the layman's idea of madness is not quite the same as the legal
concept of insanity which, again, differs from the medical term of psychosis.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-015#23:1>
In actual fact mental disorder is very common and includes various
disorders involving perception, memory, thinking, feeling and behaviour.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-015#24:1>
Symptoms such as aches and pains, giddiness, weakness,
breathlessness, palpitations, poor concentration, forgetfulness, insomnia,
appetite, weight loss, nervousness, irritability, social withdrawal, loss of
normal interest and not coping with routines, when prolonged and in the
absence of physical causes are examples of psychiatric problems.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-015#25:1>
When psychoanalytical thinking became popular and fashion deviant
behaviour was given plausible explanation by being couched in
psychopathological jargon.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-015#26:1>
Thus what was socially abnormal in the statistical sense became "
medicalised" into a mental health problem to be exempt from punishment.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-015#27:1>
On this kind of reasoning a dangerous conclusion could be reached: "
He is so bad that he must be mad." This led Menninger ( 1973) to ask "
Whatever became of sin?".

<ICE-SIN:W2A-015#28:1>
However it must be emphasised that explanation does not mean
exoneration.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-015#29:1>
On the other hand, it has been considered appropriate to include a "
supplementary classification of factors influencing health states and contact
health service" in the International Classification of Diseases edition ( ICD
9) and a " V code for conditions not attributable to mental health disorders
that are a focus of attention and treatment" in Diagnostic and Statistical
Manual of Mental Disorders ( DSM - III), and its revised edition i.e.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-015#30:1>
the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Third
Edition-Revised ( DSM - III - R).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-015#31:1>
Mental Illness, Mental Disease, Mental Disorder " Mental illness", "
mental disease" and 'mental disorder" have been loosely used interchangeably
if not synonymously in clinical practice well as in writing.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-015#32:1>
This poses no problem in everyday life but medico - legal issues are
involved, it could give rise to serious confusion and criticism.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-015#33:1>
For some psychiatrists however, even the existence of mental per se
has been challenged.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-015#34:1>
Clare ( 1986) was of the opinion that the " a tendency to disparage
the concept of disease and challenge its application to psychiatry".

<ICE-SIN:W2A-015#35:1>
He observed that historically there were two views of disease, one
arising from Hippocrates who envisaged disease as a combination of " signs,
and symptoms observed to occur together so frequently and so
characteristically as to constitute a recognisable and typical clinical
picture", and the other, by Virchow who insisted that disease should be
localised in the body as lesion.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-015#36:1>
Clare noted that Szasz ( 1974) used this concept of disease to negate
the existence of mental disease.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-015#37:1>
Disease had been defined as a disturbance of the function or
structure of an organ or part of the body, and since the mind was neither an
organ or part of the body, it could not be diseased, and consequently the
concept of " mental disease" would be incorrect.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-015#38:1>
Lewis ( 1953) in his influential paper on " Health as a social
concept" cautioned that mental disease should not be inferred from only a
deviant, maladapted, non-conforming behaviour.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-015#39:1>
There should be " impairment in psychological part-functions" like
perception, learning, remembering, feeling, thinking, motivation, impulse
control.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-015#40:1>
In mental illnesses such as disturbance in part-functions occurred.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-015#41:1>
Thus Lewis took the moderate stand between the two extreme positions
of psychiatry that mental illness was either non-existent, or that it existed
in conditions that deviated statistically from the norm in the form of
deviant behaviour.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-015#42:1>
In physical disease emphasis is put on biological factors and their
manifestations.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-015#43:1>
However the human person is made up of his biological or physical,
psychological, social and spiritual attributes.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-015#44:1>
Their functioning and well-being are interrelated, interactional and
integrated.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-015#45:1>
Disturbance in any one area will affect the rest of the individual
causing distress to the whole person.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-015#46:1>
The psychiatrist takes into consideration all these factors which may
contribute in different proportions requiring different approach and
management.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-015#47:1>
Thus at one end the condition may be obviously physical, organic and
medical while at the other end, it is just psychosocial and reactional or a
problem in living.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-015#48:1>
There is also a temptation, if not a tendency, to merge what is
statistically abnormal into what is pathologically abnormal.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-015#49:1>
As a result there is no general agreement as to the boundary of
mental illness.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-015#50:1>
Some psychiatrists would restrict its use to cover only the psychoses
while others would extend it to include the neuroses or more.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-015#51:1>
With regard to mental disease, it seems to imply a more organic or
medical condition.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-015#52:1>
Here again it is not easy to draw a clear line between what is
organic and what is functional.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-015#53:1>
The trend now is to put all psychiatric conditions under the " mental
disorders" which include " psychoses, neurotic disorders, personality
disorders and other non-psychotic mental disorders, mental retardation, and
other conditions that can give rise to psychiatric disorders or lead to
contact with psychiatric services" ( ICD 9).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-015#54:1>
However the legal definition of mental disorder is not quite the same
as the medical one, and in the English Mental Health Act 1983: " Mental
Disorder" means mental illness, arrested or incomplete development of mind,
psychopathic disorder and any other disorder or disability of mind.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-015#55:1>
" Mental Impairment" means a state of arrested or incomplete
development of mind which includes severe impairment of intelligence and
social functioning and is associated with abnormally aggressive or seriously
irresponsible conduct on the part of the person concerned.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-015#56:1>
" Severe Mental Impairment" means a state of arrested or incomplete
development of mind ( not amounting to severe impairment) which includes
significant impairment of intelligence and social functioning and is
associated with abnormally aggressive or seriously irresponsible conduct on
the part of the person concerned.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-015#57:1>
The Act applied to the reception, care and treatment of mentally
disordered patients, the management of their property and other related
matters.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-015#58:1>
To qualify for most purposes of the Act the patient must be suffering
from one of the four specific categories of mental disorder set in the Act -
mental illness, mental impairment, severe mental impairment or psychopathic
disorder.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-015#59:1>
Promiscuity, other immoral conduct, sexual deviance or dependence on
alcohol or drug per se are excluded from the definitions of mental disorder.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-015#60:1>
The term mental illness is underfined and its operational definition
and usage is a matter for clinical judgement in each case.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-015#61:1>
In the Singapore Mental Disorders and Treatment Act 1970 " mentally
disordered person" means any person found by due course of law to be of
unsound mind and incapable of managing himself or his affairs.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-015#62:1>
The key words are " unsound mind" which is not defined.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-015#63:1>
Historically Singapore follows the Lunatic Asylum Act of India (
1858) which was introduced in 1889.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-015#64:1>
In 1930 the word " lunatic" was changed to " person of unsound mind".

<ICE-SIN:W2A-015#65:1>
<h> Disease of the Brain and Disease of the Mind </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-015#66:1>
Sometimes the terms disease of the brain and disease of the mind are
brought up in the court.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-015#67:1>
Disease of the brain is normally the domain of the neurologist.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-015#68:1>
But as it can produce both physical and mental symptoms the
psychiatrist becomes involved when the question of criminal responsibility is
raised.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-015#69:1>
The court is interested to know whether the accused is suffering from
disease of the mind that causes defect of reason in the McNaughten Rules.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-015#70:1>
In practice, disease of the mind here refers to the psychoses whether
organic or functional.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-015#71:1>
Psychosis is phenomenologically a condition that is non -
understandable and in which the sufferer is out of touch with reality and has
no insight.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-015#72:1>
To put it in another way there is a breakdown of conformity,
communication and control.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-015#73:1>
The individual's appearance, behaviour, conversation are beyond
social expectation and acceptance.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-015#74:1>
Communication is difficult or impossible because of incoherence or
irrational ideas.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-015#75:1>
Often as a result of abnormal experience e.g.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-015#76:1>
delusion, hallucination or an inexplicable mood state, he loses
control of himself and behaves abnormally or out of character.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-015#77:1>
<h> Glossary of Mental Disorders </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-015#78:1>
Different countries may have their own diagnostic systems.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-015#79:1>
The Ninth Revision of the International Classification of Diseases (
ICD 9) by the World Health Organisation is perhaps the best known and the
most widely adopted for official uses.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-015#80:1>
In Singapore the Glossary of Mental Disorders of ICD 9 is adhered to
in clinical practice and statistical returns.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-015#81:1>
However the American Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
Disorders Third Edition or DSM-III, and the revised edition, Statistical
Manual of Mental Disorders, Third Edition ( Revised) are also used
unofficially.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-015#82:1>
However it has to be pointed out that these manuals are more for
clinical and research uses.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-015#83:1>
Other factors have to be considered when applied to forensic cases,
like " individual responsibility, disability, determination and competency" (
DSM III - R).

For each of the coding and mental disorder mentioned above there
further sub-coding and classification.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-015#120:1>
</h> Unsound Mind and Diminished Responsibility </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-015#121:1>
When the question of " unsound mind" is raised in court, the issue
refers invariably to the presence or absence of psychosis or mental
retardation relevant to the legal tests under inquiry.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-015#122:1>
The psychiatrist plays a decisive role in the determination of
unsound mind although court would have to be satisfied with the medical
opinion expressed.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-015#123:1>
In the case of " diminished responsibility" both legal and medical
concepts are involved.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-015#124:1>
The " abnormality of mind" is for the court to decide. <X>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-015#X125:1>
The psychiatrist is called upon to say whether the " abnormality of
mind" arises from " a condition of arrested or retarded development of mind
or any inherent causes or induced by disease or injury".

<ICE-SIN:W2A-015#X126:1>
On the surface, it appears straight forward.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-015#X127:1>
But what is embodied in the term " mind" is not stated.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-015#X128:1>
Does " a condition of arrested or retarded development of mind"
mean the same as " mental impairment" in the English Mental Health Act 1983?

<ICE-SIN:W2A-015#X129:1>
In which case it would include impairment of intelligence and
social functioning, and is associated with abnormally aggressive and
seriously irresponsible conduct on the part of the person concerned and does
not just mean a low IQ.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-015#X130:1>
To stretch the question further, is morality a function of the
mind?

<ICE-SIN:W2A-015#X131:1>
Again, what is " inherent" has not been defined. </X> </I>
