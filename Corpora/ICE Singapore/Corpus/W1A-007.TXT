<h> THE SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT POLICY IN THE MINISTRY OF DEFENCE,
SINGAPORE </h>

<ICE-SIN:W1A-007#2:1>
<h> INTRODUCTION </h>

<ICE-SIN:W1A-007#3:1>
<h> Policy Problem </h>

<ICE-SIN:W1A-007#4:1>
The social development policy is the outgrowth of the problems of
Singapore's pro-creation patterns as outlined by the Prime Minister Lee Kuan
Yew in his 1983 National Day Rally Speech.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-007#5:1>
There are two prongs to this lop-sided procreation pattern.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-007#6:1>
One is that Singaporeans, especially Chinese, are not reproducing
enough to replace themselves so as to stabilise the level of population in
the long run.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-007#7:1>
According to demographic theory, the ideal replacement level for a
population is two children per family.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-007#8:1>
This level has not been achieved by Singaporeans.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-007#9:1>
The targeted zero population growth was based on the assumption that
people do get married, and that the crude birth rate remained constant, which
is not so in Singapore.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-007#10:1>
The second prong of the problem is Lee's concern with the quality of
the population: that more female graduates are remaining single and thus not
represented in the next generation.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-007#11:1>
This problem is caused by the traditional preference by Asian men,
especially Chinese men, to marry women of lower or equal social and economic
status and Asian women's preference to marry men of equal of(or) higher
social and economic status.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-007#12:1>
It is the perception of the PAP government that if this trend is
allowed to continue, the quality of the population would suffer in the long
run as:

<ICE-SIN:W1A-007#13:1>
" Our economy will falter, the administration will suffer, and the
society will decline.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-007#14:1>
For how can we avoid lowering our standards, when in 25 years' time,
for every 2 graduates there will be one graduate, and for every 2 uneducated
workers there will be 3?"

<ICE-SIN:W1A-007#15:1>
Lee's concern about well-educated women was also highlighted in the
ability of educated women who were married to reproduce themselves above the
replacement level.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-007#16:1>
In 1983, the fertility rate was only 1.65 children for those women
with tertiary education, 2.0 children for those women with an upper secondary
education, 2.7 children for women with a primary education, and 3.5 for those
women without any education.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-007#17:1>
Lee's assumption has been that nature determines 80% of a person's
intelligence.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-007#18:1>
His arguments became a moot point and stirred the so-called great
Marriage debate and the Population Debate.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-007#19:1>
Lee has, however, achieved the result of starting the nation to think
about the population trends of Singapore and their implications for
Singaporeans.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-007#20:1>
The social development policy, which was on most occassions (
occasions) associated with the policy to get educated singles married, can be
said to have been implemented in January 1984 with the establishment of the
Social Development Unit ( SDU).

<ICE-SIN:W1A-007#21:1>
This paper is a case study of how this national policy is being
transplanted into the Ministry of Defence ( MINDEF).

<ICE-SIN:W1A-007#22:1>
The focus of the paper is narrow so as to allow an in-depth study of
the policy issue within MINDEF, and to avoid a general system-level analysis
which have been attempted by former students of this course on at least two
occassions.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-007#23:1>
The narrowed scope of focus will help to keep the project within
manageable length and effort.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-007#24:1>
Another government policy to tackle the population problem is to
embark on an aggressive immigration policy to attract overseas talent to
migrate to Singapore.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-007#25:1>
This policy has been dealt with in another seminar earlier on and is
not within the scope of this paper.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-007#26:1>
It is contended, however, that the net benefits from the inflow of
overseas talent may be small in the long term.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-007#27:1>
The solution to the population problem has to be supplied by
indigenous efforts to the larger extent, by increasing the relative value of
having children and to reduce the push factors that encourage people to
migrate from Singapore.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-007#28:1>
The immigration policy is more a stop-gap measure to Help balance the
so-called 'brain-drain'.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-007#29:1>
<h> Aim and Methodology </h>

<ICE-SIN:W1A-007#30:1>
The aim of the paper is to throw light on how the singles problem and
social development is being tackled in MINDEF.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-007#31:1>
The framework of analysis would be geared to look at the policy
context of the singles problem within MINDEF, the formulative aspects of the
policy, how the policy was implemented, and finally to attempt to evaluate
the policy.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-007#32:1>
<h> Policy Context </h>

<ICE-SIN:W1A-007#33:1>
The national context of the pro-creation problem was set out clearly
in a publication by Ministry of Finance called Sharing a Lifetime.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-007#34:1>
They include cultural and structural factors.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-007#35:1>
The over-riding concern of the government, however, is that tiny
Singapore is without any natural mineral resources, and the quality and
quantity of its population is the only factor that is within the manipulation
capability of the state.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-007#36:1>
Intelligent, skilled and sufficient manpower is also the only
redeeming factor that Singapore can depend on for its future growth and
survival.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-007#37:1>
<h> Cultural Factors </h>

<ICE-SIN:W1A-007#38:1>
Our Asian culture, where the man wants to be the dominant partner in
a marital relationship and thus would feel more comfortable with a less
educated wife.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-007#39:1>
<h> Structural Factors </h>

<ICE-SIN:W1A-007#40:1>
The meritocratic system which stresses on academic qualifications,
and result and achievement oriented attitudes, which leads to few
opportunities for young men and women to meet since they deem it as more
important to concentrate on getting good results in their academic
examinations and work excellence.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-007#41:1>
The problem is especially acute during schooling days, which is the
best period for them to forge a lasting relationship.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-007#42:1>
Also, an average 63% of boys who did well enough at 'O' levels chose
to enter polytechnics instead of college/pre-university classes.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-007#43:1>
These boys are apprehensive of the second language and general paper
requirements for entry into the National University of Singapore, the only
university at the moment.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-007#44:1>
The girls tend to fair better in these subjects.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-007#45:1>
There is thus a drop in the number of men entering the university,
especially in those faculties where language is important.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-007#46:1>
Economic development has led to specialisation in professions
according to sex.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-007#47:1>
Here in Singapore, gender differences tend to be well reflected in
the cross-industry segregation of the sexes.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-007#48:1>
The huge majority in the engineering and technical professions are
men, whereas the teaching, accounting and other service professions tend to
be dominated by women.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-007#49:1>
This industrial segregation tends to reduce the opportunities for men
and women to meet.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-007#50:1>
Where the state has successfully achieved an economic development
programme to provide for basic services.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-007#51:1>
In Singapore, it is argued that the PAP government's ability to
provide amenities and invest in labour quality to facilitate upward social
mobility independent of kinship connections have greatly affected family
lives.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-007#52:1>
This is because the state agencies fulfilled many personal needs that
have traditionally been satisfied via kinship and personal ties.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-007#53:1>
As early as 1969, there were observations that in line with
modernisation and economic development, traditional mechanisms for mate
selection, especially among the Chinese, have broken down.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-007#54:1>
There has been a movement away from parental dominance in marital
choice and young people were beginning to spend more time in pre-marital
relationships with the opposite sex.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-007#55:1>
This increasing contact, independent of parental pressure cultivated
the ideology of personal and free choice as a pre-requisite to conjugal bliss
and contributed to the breaking-down of the institutions of match-making.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-007#56:1>
The value of children appeared to have declined in the post
independence years, particularly after the government adopted rapid
industrialisation as the path to rapid economic growth and development.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-007#57:1>
The institution of the Central Provident Fund helped to guarantee a
financially stable life for the retired even without the help of their
children.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-007#58:1>
In addition, in view of the existence of a huge unemployment problem
in the 1960s, a strongly anti-natalist population policy was adopted to
pronounce the benefits of having two or less children, one of which was the
strengthened ability and better hope of a family ascending socially if it had
less children to divide the family pie.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-007#59:1>
The value of children in providing long term security and immediate
comfort became relatively less, with a resulting impact on fertility desires
and behaviour.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-007#60:1>
In summation, structural and cultural, factors have shaped the
circumstances of the population problem of the 1980s, which is now one of the
main policy priorities of the government.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-007#61:1>
At the level of this case study, MINDEF and the SAF have their policy
context which are unique to the defence organisation.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-007#62:1>
They are mainly structural, cultural and situational factors.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-007#63:1>
Culturally, the business of defence is a demanding job.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-007#64:1>
Without any compromise or alternative, the nature of the business
requires that the majority of the SAF is male.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-007#65:1>
What's more, there is an uneven distribution of men and women in SAF
workplaces, due to the nature of their respective functions which are
distributed according to gender differences.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-007#66:1>
The men are mostly concentrated in the combat and active units and
the women in civilian departments and support units.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-007#67:1>
This lessens the opportunities for the SAF men and women to meet
prospective partners within or without the Force, especially when a tiring
day at the office and units sapped their energies.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-007#68:1>
Also, the defence business requires that there is constant
preparedness and regular training be conducted among men.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-007#69:1>
Tight training schedules, shift work and being put on course
frequently are often the direct contributing factors in reducing the amount
of time for socialising, which soldiers, especially men, have to give up for
the sake of career and country.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-007#70:1>
What's more, the far location of the units makes the process of
disseminating information about social activities difficult and cumbersome,
and information often do not reach the servicemen in time for him to
participate in those activities.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-007#71:1>
Situationally, circumstances like long hours of work during military
exercises, mobilisation exercises, the distance and location of the unit from
the centres of social interaction, and the perhaps unsupportive attitudes of
some superior officers in granting leave or time-off may hamper opportunities
for single servicemen to interact socially.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-007#72:1>
As at 31/12/1987, about 64% of the SAF regulars ( excluding a large
number of single young men in Full-time National Service) remains single.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-007#73:1>
The majority of these singles are below 30 years old, and 65% of them
are below 24.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-007#74:1>
Therefore, although MINDEF is perceived by the SDU as having a large
pool of singles alongside other ministries like Education, National
Development, trade and Industry, Health and Home Affairs, it can be seen that
the age structure of MINDEF's singles render it a problem that is not as
serious as in other cases.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-007#75:1>
Specifically, the SAF single male officers generally should not have
a problem in finding life partners due to the SAF's successful efforts in
recent years to raise the social esteem of the soldiering occupation and of
its officers ranks especially.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-007#76:1>
Due to their reasonable pay and job security, male Force officers are
in fact among the most eligible bachelors.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-007#77:1>
Among the married in the Force, 81% of them have no children, and 51%
of the childless are in the 25-34 age group.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-007#78:1>
This is the more serious aspect of the population problem existing
within MINDEF and the SAF.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-007#79:1>
How then, have MINDEF and the SAF set out to tackle the problem?

<ICE-SIN:W1A-007#80:1>
<h> Policy Formulation </h>

<ICE-SIN:W1A-007#81:1>
Having identified the policy problem, MINDEF set out to formulate a
policy to resolve the problem.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-007#82:1>
Policy formulation, as defined by Anderson, " involves the
development of pertinent and acceptable proposed courses of action for
dealing with public problems." If a necessary course of action in the process
of policy formulation is to identify all alternatives possible within certain
time, space, resource and cultural constraints, then there is no such course
of action taken in MINDEF.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-007#83:1>
Rather, current policies are the result of incremental developments.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-007#84:1>
In early 1987, a Social Development Section ( SDS) was set up as a
branch of the SAF Personnel Services Centre ( SAFPSC) as NINDEF's follow-up
to the establishment of the SDU within the Ministry of Finance.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-007#85:1>
Prior to this, the Officers' Personnel Centre of MINDEF had within
its structure a MINDEF Social Interaction Committee ( MSIC) with only a
part-time staff.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-007#86:1>
In comparison, the SDS in SAFPSC had a full-time staff instead, which
was justified by an expansion of singles development activities to include 'A'
and 'O' level singles in MINDEF.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-007#87:1>
While the duties of the MSIC

<ICE-SIN:W1A-007#88:1>
was only to provide information about an nominate singles to
participate in SDU activities - publicise SDU activities within MINDEF -
participate in policy making at the SDU, the role of the SDS became a)To plan
and assist in the interaction of singles through activities, with its own
budget and manpower support and data base. <X>

<ICE-SIN:W1A-007#X89:1>
b. To monitor the situation and counsel singles.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-007#X90:1>
c. Solicit support from departments within MINDEF.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-007#X91:1>
d. Liaison and cooperate with external social development agencies.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-007#X92:1>
e. Encourage child-bearing as desirable. </X> </I>
