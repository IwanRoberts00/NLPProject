<ICE-SIN:S2A-039#1:1:A>
Well good afternoon to all of you

<ICE-SIN:S2A-039#2:1:A>
I would appreciate if you all of you can come down a little bit so
that we can look eye-to-eye

<ICE-SIN:S2A-039#3:1:A>
We'll see double rather than having you looking down on me

<ICE-SIN:S2A-039#4:1:A>
I'm going to making me feel small

<ICE-SIN:S2A-039#5:1:A>
So quickly just move down a little bit

<ICE-SIN:S2A-039#6:1:A>
Besides I don't have the neck at all I have problem raising up head

<ICE-SIN:S2A-039#7:1:A>
True

<ICE-SIN:S2A-039#8:1:A>
Can you please come down

<ICE-SIN:S2A-039#9:1:A>
The fact that you're here this afternoon I think speaks very well
upon you

<ICE-SIN:S2A-039#10:1:A>
This is a beginning of a very exciting <unclear> word </unclear>
well for tertiary institute for tertiary learning am I right to say you're
first year

<ICE-SIN:S2A-039#11:1:A>
Just by show of hand I would like to know how many of you are doing
first year academic subjects like History Geography English Literature that
kind

<ICE-SIN:S2A-039#12:1:A>
How many

<ICE-SIN:S2A-039#13:1:A>
Okay but I'm speaking to also quite a number of people who are in
Social Sciences who are doing things like Economics Sociology Political
Science am I right

<ICE-SIN:S2A-039#14:1:A>
Okay so I know whom I'm talking to

<ICE-SIN:S2A-039#15:1:A>
Good yes as I've been introduced I am Chen Ai-yen

<ICE-SIN:S2A-039#16:1:A>
Geetha was in NIE four years ago five years ago three well only
three and you can see that she is still as young as ever

<ICE-SIN:S2A-039#17:1:A>
One of the greatest delight of a teacher is to really see your
student grow and bloom

<ICE-SIN:S2A-039#18:1:A>
And she was like that but now there's even more poise

<ICE-SIN:S2A-039#19:1:A>
Do you think that she's very very confident

<ICE-SIN:S2A-039#20:1:A>
Yes she's really happening

<ICE-SIN:S2A-039#21:1:A>
Okay of course it has nothing to do with one fact she was one of my
favourites

<ICE-SIN:S2A-039#22:1:A>
Alright that she was in my tutorial and I know her intimately well

<ICE-SIN:S2A-039#23:1:A>
Well but it's not that because she talked about the challenges and
realities of teaching and one of the realities is that you really know people

<ICE-SIN:S2A-039#24:1:A>
True you people

<ICE-SIN:S2A-039#25:1:A>
She also talked about that teaching is very very different from
other jobs

<ICE-SIN:S2A-039#26:1:A>
Very true

<ICE-SIN:S2A-039#27:1:A>
Sometimes beginning you are skeptical

<ICE-SIN:S2A-039#28:1:A>
How do you know

<ICE-SIN:S2A-039#29:1:A>
You know this from <unclear> word </unclear> the others are just
imagination

<ICE-SIN:S2A-039#30:1:A>
Let me tell you my personal example okay

<ICE-SIN:S2A-039#31:1:A>
I did not join teaching as uhm a first career

<ICE-SIN:S2A-039#32:1:A>
When I graduated from at that time it's called the University of
Malaya and Singapore long time ago I actually join the then Radio and
Television Singapore

<ICE-SIN:S2A-039#33:1:A>
I was a news editor it was exciting jobs

<ICE-SIN:S2A-039#34:1:A>
I was in parliament

<ICE-SIN:S2A-039#35:1:A>
I was chasing facts I'll be all over the place you know and you
write bold stories

<ICE-SIN:S2A-039#36:1:A>
Mine you at that time because there're very few people you do more
things than people nowadays because now usually they're more specilisation

<ICE-SIN:S2A-039#37:1:A>
And I was in the job for five years

<ICE-SIN:S2A-039#38:1:A>
There were times when Dan Buttsworth you know with the oil rig
names people will say you want to go Vietnam you want to go uh Sarawak you
want to go here and there and I always drawback

<ICE-SIN:S2A-039#39:1:A>
And I said I'm only a woman you know I think it'll be too dangerous
to go out to the field in that those ways

<ICE-SIN:S2A-039#40:1:A>
It is true life out there in journalism

<ICE-SIN:S2A-039#41:1:A>
I now it's a very very uh popular subject nowadays very exciting

<ICE-SIN:S2A-039#42:1:A>
It's true you talk to people

<ICE-SIN:S2A-039#43:1:A>
It's true it's people orientated but not quite centred

<ICE-SIN:S2A-039#44:1:A>
In no time in journalism really shapes the lives of people and no
time is journalist really eight hours interacting with students

<ICE-SIN:S2A-039#45:1:A>
Well I may not have eight hours in fact time <unclear> word
</unclear>

<ICE-SIN:S2A-039#46:1:A>
I'm dead because we were in a tertiary hold you know

<ICE-SIN:S2A-039#47:1:A>
I am I'm not with secondary school

<ICE-SIN:S2A-039#48:1:A>
But in secondary school it's true

<ICE-SIN:S2A-039#49:1:A>
When you have a school function sometimes you literally live with
them

<ICE-SIN:S2A-039#50:1:A>
I know of one JC teacher who happen to be single who actually live
in the school during examination time just to be with the students and all
the students no wonder did very well

<ICE-SIN:S2A-039#51:1:A>
Midnight he plays basketball somebody in VJC

<ICE-SIN:S2A-039#52:1:A>
I think some of you may know who this is alright

<ICE-SIN:S2A-039#53:1:A>
So this is what I call a mark of dedication

<ICE-SIN:S2A-039#54:1:A>
Doing so you are a model the person did not set himself out to be a
model but sometimes you became a model who is much talked about and everybody
remembers him

<ICE-SIN:S2A-039#55:1:A>
So it's not just uh imparter of knowledge he's actually a moulder
of dreams a moulder of lives

<ICE-SIN:S2A-039#56:1:A>
And it's no wonder Renuka said that perhaps the reason why you're
here your teachers contributed towards that

<ICE-SIN:S2A-039#57:1:A>
Of course many of you would say it is me who has done a lot of
study okay

<ICE-SIN:S2A-039#58:1:A>
So now what have I got to do when I'm here not just to affirm
whatever Geetha has said

<ICE-SIN:S2A-039#59:1:A>
She said that teaching is truly exciting is truly exciting is truly
challenging

<ICE-SIN:S2A-039#60:1:A>
It's not just that but also to tell you that when you come to
teaching in other profession I'm not exactly sure they truly give you a
professional degree

<ICE-SIN:S2A-039#61:1:A>
But when you become a teacher you are trained professional

<ICE-SIN:S2A-039#62:1:A>
Don't believe you go into engineering course you into accountancy
course which are courses of NTU that I know quite well by now

<ICE-SIN:S2A-039#63:1:A>
You're are given all the subjects to learn you go through practical

<ICE-SIN:S2A-039#64:1:A>
Exactly how to behave like an engineer nobody told them how

<ICE-SIN:S2A-039#65:1:A>
True

<ICE-SIN:S2A-039#66:1:A>
You'll say engineering and accountancy is problem-solving and
keeping records

<ICE-SIN:S2A-039#67:1:A>
What else

<ICE-SIN:S2A-039#68:1:A>
Nothing else

<ICE-SIN:S2A-039#69:1:A>
We can tell you we teacher in <unclear> word </unclear> can tell
you what this profession involves and how does a train look

<ICE-SIN:S2A-039#70:1:A>
And this is what you do

<ICE-SIN:S2A-039#71:1:A>
We have specific goals

<ICE-SIN:S2A-039#72:1:A>
At the end of our training we can be sure that you are
knowledgeable you're competent and you're reflective

<ICE-SIN:S2A-039#73:1:A>
You look at Geetha she's only one of many excellent teachers

<ICE-SIN:S2A-039#74:1:A>
By the time you go through just a one year programme you'll be
knowledgeable in the ways of the child not perfect of course

<ICE-SIN:S2A-039#75:1:A>
Everyday is a journey towards learning

<ICE-SIN:S2A-039#76:1:A>
You'll learn more about should you go into the PGDE Primary
programme more about children their developments

<ICE-SIN:S2A-039#77:1:A>
If you go into PGDE Secondary programme you would know how all
about adolescents

<ICE-SIN:S2A-039#78:1:A>
If you go into PGDE Physical Education programme you will be more
knowledgeable about the way not only people behave but the way the physical
means and built so that you can stretch how your body can really go into uhm
the the the maximum

<ICE-SIN:S2A-039#79:1:A>
You become very competent communicators

<ICE-SIN:S2A-039#80:1:A>
One of the greatest things of professionals is to be able to
communicate well

<ICE-SIN:S2A-039#81:1:A>
I'm quite likely sure that an engineer or an accountant or well
medical doctors usually speak quite well some of the people really speak very
well

<ICE-SIN:S2A-039#82:1:A>
Teachers in general get through because they have specialist speech
training

<ICE-SIN:S2A-039#83:1:A>
They speak well they certainly know what they're talking the only
thing is how to stop them right

<ICE-SIN:S2A-039#84:1:A>
There might be some true that we talk all the time we are
reflective I think we think over what we have done

<ICE-SIN:S2A-039#85:1:A>
You can never find another lecture of mine exactly the same even if
it is said in the afternoon

<ICE-SIN:S2A-039#86:1:A>
You can be sure because you know how to gear our teaching to the
needs of your audience

<ICE-SIN:S2A-039#87:1:A>
You noticed what I did the very time I must know my audience

<ICE-SIN:S2A-039#88:1:A>
I must know who I'm talking to

<ICE-SIN:S2A-039#89:1:A>
I know you're from Arts and Social Science the first year

<ICE-SIN:S2A-039#90:1:A>
I know what exactly what are the subjects you're taking because it
helped me in the way I pitch my conversation

<ICE-SIN:S2A-039#91:1:A>
So reflection is not just to be about lagu <unclear> word
</unclear> and in deep thought and when people talk to you you don't know
answer

<ICE-SIN:S2A-039#92:1:A>
I don't mean that

<ICE-SIN:S2A-039#93:1:A>
I mean that you factually think through and think back on the
things you do

<ICE-SIN:S2A-039#94:1:A>
So that's one way that you can grow a mark of a growing
professional

<ICE-SIN:S2A-039#95:1:A>
So the goals of our teacher education programme are simply three
very simple they get not that easily achievable but you do

<ICE-SIN:S2A-039#96:1:A>
How do we make you do this

<ICE-SIN:S2A-039#97:1:A>
So we have courses in educational studies professional courses

<ICE-SIN:S2A-039#98:1:A>
We have courses in curriculum studies to make you teach in subject
areas

<ICE-SIN:S2A-039#99:1:A>
This is where I come into

<ICE-SIN:S2A-039#100:1:A>
Why did I ask you to raise your hands

<ICE-SIN:S2A-039#101:1:A>
If you are have academic subjects here in NUS you're entering into
the excitement of the discipline in certain discipline alright

<ICE-SIN:S2A-039#102:1:A>
If you have academic discipline like Literature English you know
even Chinese or or some other subject which I subjects which you take well
you become you is very easy for you to become PGDE Secondary teachers

<ICE-SIN:S2A-039#103:1:A>
Because your specialisation subjects and later on I think Rebuka
uh will tell you more about that

<ICE-SIN:S2A-039#104:1:A>
But if you are not but if you have read <unclear> word </unclear>
Economics Social Work or what it is Psychology and that sort of thing well
chance is that you will be doing the teacher course in primary school because
you don't have content knowledge or such a depth as to be able to meet the
challenge of the school

<ICE-SIN:S2A-039#105:1:A>
We have not said that you would not be parting knowledge in terms
of discipline right you will

<ICE-SIN:S2A-039#106:1:A>
But this is not the one thing you do

<ICE-SIN:S2A-039#107:1:A>
It is one of the many things you do but it is a very important
thing so you must have content

<ICE-SIN:S2A-039#108:1:A>
Now that will help you

<ICE-SIN:S2A-039#109:1:A>
I think those of you come here we'll like to complement you and
you to select your courses wisely

<ICE-SIN:S2A-039#110:1:A>
Don't just say Psychology is very important

<ICE-SIN:S2A-039#111:1:A>
Sociologists are also very important

<ICE-SIN:S2A-039#112:1:A>
But actually I want to teach in secondary school

<ICE-SIN:S2A-039#113:1:A>
Well too bad because you do not have <unclear> word </unclear>
academic subject

<ICE-SIN:S2A-039#114:1:A>
Whereas if you are a graduate in any of those disciplines and you
want to do PE the consideration is slightly different

<ICE-SIN:S2A-039#115:1:A>
You will really like to be very robust and strong physique and
good in your physical coordinations before you can be considered you know for
that kind of degree

<ICE-SIN:S2A-039#116:1:A>
So there must be something which is natural in you before we can
nurture you as well <unclear> word </unclear> okay

<ICE-SIN:S2A-039#117:1:A>
And so this is quite true you have to consider teaching curriculum
studies how to teach those subjects

<ICE-SIN:S2A-039#118:1:A>
By the time you come to us we won't be teaching you the content of
Geography or History or Literature but we will teach you how to teach those
subjects

<ICE-SIN:S2A-039#119:1:A>
I hope you can you are with me clear? okay because that helps too
in the shaping uhm selection of your subjects

<ICE-SIN:S2A-039#120:1:A>
And the third part which is very important is the time you really
gain practice in school

<ICE-SIN:S2A-039#121:1:A>
And you will have the cooperation of teachers like Geetha Manee

<ICE-SIN:S2A-039#122:1:A>
I'm sure she has been cooperating teachers to some younger
teachers and pass on her skills

<ICE-SIN:S2A-039#123:1:A>
You work with professionals in a very professional way including

<ICE-SIN:S2A-039#124:1:A>
How to handle mundane routine things like timetable

<ICE-SIN:S2A-039#125:1:A>
Nobody likes it and yet you know how to smile you know and because
well in every sphere of life there are certain things you don't like to do

<ICE-SIN:S2A-039#126:1:A>
But you just have to do okay so timetable is one instance

<ICE-SIN:S2A-039#127:1:A>
So this is what we promise you one year programme and we will give
you a fully trained programme

<ICE-SIN:S2A-039#128:1:A>
For those of you who are in Chinese or uhm uhm general not
Japanese Chinese or Malay you will be recruited into the PGDE special
programme where you would be taking not just uhm uh the the these courses
that I am telling you

<ICE-SIN:S2A-039#129:1:A>
In addition to educational studies and going through the practical
in your curricular area you will be specialising in the languages that you're
specialising and your moral education

<ICE-SIN:S2A-039#130:1:A>
So in brief this is the course that we offer to all the graduates
of GDPE primary secondary and physical education

<ICE-SIN:S2A-039#131:1:A>
Three years time four years time I'm looking forward to welcome
you to with open arms as fellow professionals </I>
