<h> ABSTRACT </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-031#6:1>
This paper was prepared to identify the role of food biotechnology as
a new cornerstone for Singapore food industry.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-031#7:1>
The present status of Singapore food industry was first examined.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-031#8:1>
From the relevant statistics, the importances and shortcomings of the
industry were revealed.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-031#9:1>
This was followed by a brief introduction of what food biotechnology
can offer.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-031#10:1>
The powertul and versatile conversion capability, the high
selectivities and specificities, the production economy and limitations of
food biotechnology were highlighted.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-031#11:1>
The progress and plans of the development of biotechnology in some
advanced countries were next reviewed.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-031#12:1>
The paper concluded by proposing a few important measures that might
serve as guidelines in preparing ourselves to meet this new challenge.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-031#13:1>
These measures included restructuring of the Industry, provision of
appropriate government incentives, establishing a broad-based venture capital
market, setting up a food biotechnology research and information centre as
well as provision of training, education and a set of relevant laws and
regulations.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-031#14:1>
Emphasis had also been placed on the issue of long term implications,
rather than immediate impacts, of food biotechnology on the industry.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-031#15:1>
THE PRESENT STATUS OF FOOD INDUSTRY IN SINGAPORE Food and beverage
industry was probably one of the oldest members of the manufacturing sector
in human history.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-031#16:1>
In Singapore, it could be traced back to the early establishment era.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-031#17:1>
Today, food and beverage industry ranks at the fourth place according
to the value of output in the Republic after machinery and appliances,
petroleum and chemical products.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-031#18:1>
There are over 300 food production establishments which employ ten or
more persons operating in the Island.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-031#19:1>
The workforce engaged is more than 4% of the total employment of the
manufacturing sector ( see Table 1).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-031#20:1>
The training content in the labour force is generally low.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-031#21:1>
So far, about one for every ten food factory workers has received
some form of skilled training as compared to three for every ten workers on
the national average.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-031#22:1>
The productivity of this industry is also below the national average.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-031#23:1>
The value added for the food manufactured products in 1978 and 1988
were S&dollar;207 million and S&dollar;495 million respectively.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-031#24:1>
This represented a growth rate of 9.1%.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-031#25:1>
The value added per worker needs further improvements as well.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-031#26:1>
Nonetheless, the values of domestic export demonstrated remarkable
expansion.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-031#27:1>
For food alone, it grew from S&dollar;48.4 million in 1960, S&dollar;105.4 million
in 1970, S&dollar;600.6 million in 1980 to S&dollar;904.7 million in 1988.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-031#28:1>
These data did not take beverage and animal/vegetable oils into
account ( see Table 2). <X>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-031#34:1>
From the above statistics we can conclude clearly that food and
beverage industry contributes positively and significantly to our national
economy.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-031#35:1>
However.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-031#36:1>
the present status of the food and beverage industry from the
technology and modernisation viewpoint is far from satisfactory.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-031#37:1>
Most of the establishments in this industry still remain at the low
skill and labour intensive stage.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-031#38:1>
The progress on mechanisation and automation though forthcoming is at
a very slow pace.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-031#39:1>
In fact.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-031#40:1>
many are continuing to operate as small family business using
traditional arts and skills.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-031#41:1>
Quality control, attractive packaging design, good manufacturing
practices and other modern management practices and techniques seem to have
been insulated from this sector apart from a handful of concerns.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-031#42:1>
On the whole, food and beverage industry in Singapore is due for
up-grading and restructuring.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-031#43:1>
This is the time to introduce some structural changes and innovations
to the industry so that it will survive through the even more competitive and
challenging environment of the 90's.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-031#44:1>
It needs some new cornerstones in the operation so that it can
maintain or even enhance its contributions to the nations.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-031#45:1>
WHAT BIOTECHNOLOGY CAN OFFER?

<ICE-SIN:W2A-031#46:1>
The impacts of biotechnology on food production ( agriculture),
processing and preservation are enormous and far reaching.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-031#47:1>
Biotechnology is the practical application of biosciences.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-031#48:1>
It utilises bio-organisms, their sub cellular components, associated
or derived enzyme system to perform some desired functions such as formation,
transformation or decomposition in manufacturing and service industries as
well as for environmental and energy management.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-031#49:1>
At least in principle, almost all organic materials can be converted
by biotechnological techniques.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-031#50:1>
As such, the very first offer biotechnology can present is the
powerful and versatile conversion capability which opens up the production of
limitless ranges of new products and new means of making or replacing the
existing products.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-031#51:1>
The production of 'many food flavours, stabilizers, emulsifiers,
texturing agents and colours are good examples.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-031#52:1>
They can be tailor-made according to the demand.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-031#53:1>
The production of monosodium glutamate ( MSG) revolutionises the
taste and palatability of almost all cookings.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-031#54:1>
In Table 3, a forecast has been made for the total market of
biotechnological oriented products by the year 2000 AD.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-031#55:1>
It will nearly be US&dollar;77 billions!

<ICE-SIN:W2A-031#56:1>
About 40% ( ie US&dollar;30 billions) of this market is food-related.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-031#57:1>
The next offer biotechnology can make is its high selectivities and
specificities.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-031#58:1>
These characteristics have led to production of many valuable
products which may or may not be possible to be made by the conventional
technologies.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-031#59:1>
By employing the many useful tools developed in the fields of
genetics, molecular biology and fermentation, such as soma or gameto clonal
variations, tissue culturing, somatic cell hydridisation, protoplast fusion,
seed or clonal propagation, enzyme applications etc, biotechnology can lead
to manufacturing of products which possess the exact properties and
specifications as desired.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-031#60:1>
A number of vegetable oils like low erucic acid rapeseed oil ( or
Canola oil), low linolenic acid soyabean oil, low wax sunflowerseed oil,
gossipol-free cottonseed oil etc fall into this category.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-031#61:1>
High yielding rice and wheat varieties, high amylase or protein
maizes are further examples.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-031#62:1>
The extensive usages of Aspartame as a low-calorie sweetener
especially in the 'diet' soft drink industry further strengthen this feature
of biotechnology in food industry.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-031#63:1>
Biotechnology normally works on relatively inexpensive and abundantly
available raw materials.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-031#64:1>
This virtue renders it readily to be adopted and economically to be
put into practices.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-031#65:1>
It offers good human quality and nutritious food which can be sold at
consistently low price.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-031#66:1>
Long time ago, Indonesians had developed a process to introduce
fungal mycelium into soyabean cotyledons to convert the latter into tempe
kedele.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-031#67:1>
This product has been used as low cost protein rich food.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-031#68:1>
Today, we have little difficulties to find this meat analogue in many
parts of U.S.A.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-031#69:1>
and U.K..

<ICE-SIN:W2A-031#70:1>
Modern researches have also aggressively performed the growth of
various kinds of edible mushrooms on straws, wood shavings, waste paper and
cottons with remarkably short growing time.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-031#71:1>
Biotechnology can help to work on alternative raw materials as well.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-031#72:1>
This flexibility resolves many supply problems arising from seasonal
pattern, price fluctuation and transportation.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-031#73:1>
For instance, high fructose syrup originally from corn starch is also
produced by sago or tapioca starches in the tropical countries where corns
are not readily available.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-031#74:1>
Fructoses which is 30% sweeter than sugar are commonly found in
beverages, frozen confectionery and bread nowadays. <X>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-031#76:1>
Biotechnology can offer competitiveness to production costs
favourably.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-031#77:1>
Once the strains had been identified and improved, mutation can be
applied to increase the production of lipases.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-031#78:1>
As a result, they can overproduce even scarce natural product and
enhance the productivity of the process.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-031#79:1>
The biotechnological reactions usually run at or near ambient
temperature.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-031#80:1>
There is no necessity for expensive repeated heating and cooling.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-031#81:1>
Biotechnology also avoids extreme conditions in terms of acid,
vacuum, pressure etc.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-031#82:1>
Tremendous savings can be achieved from energy conservation and
hardware fabrication.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-031#83:1>
Biotechnology can further affect production costs in a positive
manner by reducing the land or space requirements, increasing the product
resistances and tolerances, improving product yields, eliminating some
process steps hence some expenses and losses.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-031#84:1>
All of these contribute to making cheaper finished products.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-031#85:1>
However, the applications of biotechnology are not without
limitations.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-031#86:1>
A major deterrent to the employment of biotechnological processes
currently may be the cost of enzymes.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-031#87:1>
After the development of immobilised enzyme technology, the expansive
enzyme can be recovered after it has performed its task and be reused again.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-031#88:1>
In this way, the amount of material processed per unit mass of enzyme
can be greatly increased.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-031#89:1>
Biotechnology is restricted by many practical considerations,
environmental factors, current state-of-art in technology, as well as health
and safety regulations.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-031#90:1>
Biotechnological processes are extremely sensitive to contaminations
especially those of microbial nature.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-031#91:1>
Strict sterilisation must be carried out thoroughly for fermenters,
vessels, pipelines, fittings and other plants equipment.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-031#92:1>
Environmental and atmospheric cleanliness must strictly be ensured
and controlled.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-031#93:1>
Due to the specific nature, scaleup is always a tedious and
controversial process.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-031#94:1>
Operating conditions of biotechnological reactions must be exactly
determined and accurately implemented so that repetitive results can be
achieved consistently.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-031#95:1>
The downstream processes such as separation and purification can be
costly to operate as well.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-031#96:1>
Even after the finished products have been produced, it is costly and
time consuming to obtain " fit for human consumption" approval or 'gras' (
generally regard as safe) status.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-031#97:1>
Strict regulations, operating procedure and precautions must also be
documented to ensure the safety of handling personnel, consuming public and
the environment.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-031#98:1>
That is why, for the time being, biotechnology seems to be
successfully applied only to high value added products.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-031#99:1>
<h> WHAT OTHERS ARE DOING? </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-031#100:1>
Currently, the world development of biotechnology is led by the
United States.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-031#101:1>
In America, the federal agencies play the role of providing adequate
manpower training, up-to-date infrastructure, conducive environment and
regulatory control for the progress in biotechnology.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-031#102:1>
The actual industrial and commercial activities are carried out by
the private corporations.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-031#103:1>
A large number of large and small private enterprises have been
established during the last few years to commercialise the know-how derived
from the research and development in the biotechnological field.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-031#104:1>
In Japan, a biotechnological office had been set up by MITI to
promote and co-ordinate biotechnological works in general.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-031#105:1>
Special attention has been given to those research work which cannot
be accommodate under existing facilities and infrastructure.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-031#106:1>
In particular, a systematic programme has been adopted for the
development of enzyme technology.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-031#107:1>
The pace of progress of biotechnology in the EEC countries is not as
swift as their counterparts in USA and Japan.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-031#108:1>
Nonetheless, the French Government has set up an agency known as 'Codis'
to look after the growth of biotechnology.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-031#109:1>
The West Germany Government plays an active role in the funding and
planning of biotechnological research in universities, research centres and
industries.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-031#110:1>
The Chemical Economic Development Committee of UK emphasises the
need for more biotechnological research efforts on selective basis to be
conducted in the manufacturing sector.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-031#111:1>
In Canada, Allelix Inc intends to spend US&dollar;100 million over the next
10 years to focus on commercialisation of their biotechnological based
products and processes.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-031#112:1>
CSIRO, Australia, on the other hand, has given the highest priority
for the continued development of genetic engineering techniques and the
continued research with recombinated DNA strains.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-031#113:1>
She has also established an industrial microbiology unit for
innovative research.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-031#114:1>
Although the above progress is more for biotechnology in general,
the same trend can be said for the food development.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-031#115:1>
In short, practically all the governments and private sectors of the
developed countries have endorsed the powerful and promising role of
biotechnology in the coming technological era and launched the basis and
infrastructure to cultivate and built it up into a new cornerstone for the
food and process industries.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-031#116:1>
<h> WHAT SHOULD WE DO? </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-031#117:1>
If we would like to maintain our existence in the food field in the
90's and beyond and if we would like to enhance our contributions to the
Singapore economic development, we cannot ignore or overlook the effects of
this new cornerstone, food biotechnology.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-031#118:1>
We must keep up with the world in developing it, at company,
industry as well as national levels.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-031#119:1>
The following are some of the measures we may be able to take up in
order to achieve the goal.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-031#120:1>
( a) To pull all resources, facilities, talent and financial
strength in the food and beverage industry together to face the challenge.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-031#121:1>
This is easy in saying then doing.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-031#122:1>
It is not easy to convince the competing food operators to cooperate
and to give up their traditional practices. <X>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-031#X123:1>
Nonetheless, we must endeavour to achieve a critical mass in order
to receive this new technology either through joint venture of technology
transfer.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-031#X124:1>
We must invite some multinational and specialised companies related
to food biotechnology to join our industry and to invest in our development.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-031#X125:1>
( b) To provide good financial, tax and other incentives by
government, at least at this initial stage.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-031#X126:1>
We expect food biotechnological projects will only yield long term
benefits.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-031#X127:1>
Some unusually attractive incentives such as 15-20 years period tax
holidays, total tax exemption on capital gain, generous incentives for
unlisted securities market, ready provisions for tax offsetting on losses etc
must be offered.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-031#X128:1>
Incentives for biotechnological projects must be focussed on both
returns and losses.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-031#X129:1>
Incentives must not only be limited to the production of the
finished products, but also be extended to the concept, the methodology, the
assay, the design, the process, the biomedia and the intermediates.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-031#X130:1>
Research grants must be readily available for the encouraged areas
and areas of general applicability such as screening, culture collection and
identification, separation, purification and some common expensive equipment
and facilities.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-031#X131:1>
Grants should also be made available for all activities that
initiate and promote food biotechnology.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-031#X132:1>
( c) To make available venture capital and long term high risk
financial funding.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-031#X133:1>
As mentioned earlier, food biotechnological projects are high-risk
by nature.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-031#X134:1>
The traditional financiers may not understand and appreciate this
nature and prepare to accept the consequences.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-031#X135:1>
As such, there is a strong need to have a broad-based venture
capital market here.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-031#X136:1>
Food biotechnological ventures tend to offer future promises with
little immediate returns.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-031#X137:1>
( d) To set up food biotechnology pilot plant and information
centre.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-031#X138:1>
It is an important step to establish a centralised food biocentre
to provide relevant data base, up-to-date information and adequate facilities
to carry out bench scale research, pilot plant trials, optimisation and scale
up studies, modelling and simulations etc.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-031#X139:1>
We must prepare an organised and systematic programme for the
applied R&D work on selective basis.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-031#X140:1>
A priority list must be drawn out according to our needs and
capability.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-031#X141:1>
This is to prevent any disconnected, duplicated and redundant
efforts which may lead to wastages and delay.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-031#X142:1>
A good starting point may be to look at regionally available
materials or locally demanded products.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-031#X143:1>
Some forms of linkages must be established between this centre and
her counterpart in the developed countries such as NSF ( USA), BRI ( Canada),
TNO ( Holland), INRA ( France), NPC ( New Zealand), CSIRO ( Australia).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-031#X144:1>
If possible, these linkages must be extended to the Universities
and some private laboratories as well.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-031#X145:1>
( e) To provide training and education.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-031#X146:1>
These are at least three set of training and educational programme
to be set up.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-031#X147:1>
The first group of people needed to be kept abreast with the latest
development of food biotechnology are the decision makers of both public and
private sectors including financial institutions.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-031#X148:1>
Unlike other high-tech industries, such as electronic and computer,
food biotechnological research is mostly presented in the form of ideas and
techniques.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-031#X149:1>
More often than not, there may be no proto-type manufacturing or
product until the very later stage of the project.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-031#X150:1>
The next group of people we would like to train are the
biotechnologists.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-031#X151:1>
These include professionals, specialists and technicians of many
disciplines.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-031#X152:1>
The tertiary academic institutions like the Universities and
Polytechnics, including the food biocentre mentioned above, will inevitably
play an active role for such education.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-031#X153:1>
Of course, we must supplement the formal training with close
interaction with the industry and extensive exchanges with the oversea
counterparts.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-031#X154:1>
Last but not least, we should not overlook the importance of common
awareness among the general public and consumers on food biotechnology.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-031#X155:1>
If we can bring home the message that food biotechnology will
inevitably become part and parcel of our lives for well being in not too
distant future, we shall not only lessen their psychological fears on the
subject, but also increase their level of willingness and confidence to
accept food biotechnological products.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-031#X156:1>
Giving due recognition of food biotechnology in the primary and
secondary school curricula with some general publicities via public media,
campaigns, exhibitions, seminars etc should assist us to achieve the
necessary awareness.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-031#X157:1>
( f) To establish a set of laws and regulations: There are at least
two aspects of the laws and regulations we have to consider.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-031#X158:1>
Firstly, for human and environment safety.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-031#X159:1>
Although bioorganisms cultured and/or modified in biotechnological
works are unlikely to possess sufficiently strong surviving capability
outside the controlled environment, we cannot afford to take this assumption
in total confidence.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-031#X160:1>
We must have a set of appropriate laws and regulations which
details the guidelines of handling bioorganisms, bioproducts and
apparatus/equipment used in the biosystems.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-031#X161:1>
Another aspect of the laws that we need to review is the
proprietary rights on intellectural properties such as patent protections,
copyrights, etc.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-031#X162:1>
If we wish to encourage our researchers and entrepreneurs to
venture into new and unexplored areas, easy and fast access to patent
protection including inexpensive legal expenses, simple application
procedures etc are the essential incentives.

For food biotechnology, we should give weights to the patent rights
of ideas, concepts, bioorganisms, methodology, assays, techniques etc as well
as to that of the products, design, equipment and processes.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-031#X164:1>
Some forms of regional and international co-operation in the
enforcement of these laws must also be looked into.

<h> CONCLUDING REMARKS </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-031#X166:1>
From the current status of development, we do not expect food
biotechnology to cause drastic changes of our industrial base in the nearby
terms.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-031#X167:1>
We are still at the germinating stage.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-031#X168:1>
There are many legal, financial, technical and technological
obstacles to be removed.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-031#X169:1>
There are also many human and environment problems to be resolved.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-031#X170:1>
But this does not mean we can overlook or hold the 'wait and see'
attitude for this trend.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-031#X171:1>
With the present sophistication on information and
telecommunication, we can anticipate the cycle time of any industrial
revolution will be shortened.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-031#X172:1>
We must assess carefully the long terms impact and implications of
food biotechnology as a new cornerstone to the food development of mankind in
general and Singapore food industry in particular. </X> </I>
