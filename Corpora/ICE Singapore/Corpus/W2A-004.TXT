<ICE-SIN:W2A-004#3:1>
Contemporary Kantian and Utilitarian attempts to convict someone of
irrationality, in willfully ignoring the interests of others, constitute, at
the same time, an attempt to give an account of the reason or reasons which
anyone necessarily has, as a rational being, to be responsive to the
interests and needs of others.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-004#4:1>
These are reasons which, though not manifestly present in all cases,
are said to form the underlying basis of any concern which we may show
towards our fellow beings.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-004#5:1>
Seen from another perspective, the universalisability criterion is not
merely a tool to be used in moral argument, but defines moral reason - any
moral reason - as being grounded on rational and universal principle.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-004#6:1>
For reasons which shall become clearer, I shall label this description
of the moral point of view 'impersonalism'.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-004#7:1>
It implies as just said, that any moral reason, properly called, is
always based, implicitly if not explicitly, on a principle or principles, or
that the reason must at least be subsumable under a universal principle.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-004#8:1>
Even if one claims that one's reason for action is not appropriately
described as being based on a universal principle, the claim of impersonalism
is that one is committed, by virtue of one's reason being called a moral
reason, to universalising the reason.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-004#9:1>
I argue, through a description of the moral development of Dorothea,
in Middlemarch, that there is a kind of concern which one is never under any
obligation to show, and such that one could never be committed to say, 'Anyone
( similarly placed) ought to act under it ( or that it would be wrong not
to)'.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-004#10:1>
It would not only be inappropriate, but mistaken, to try to justify
such concern with a principle which universalizes one's reason for action,
expressing the kind of concern described.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-004#11:1>
The contrasting example of Rosamond shows how the structure of her (
Rosamond's) egoistic action is impersonally based.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-004#12:1>
A reason which is impersonally grounded, as being based on principle,
whether egoistic or non-egoistic, if applied in certain contexts of personal
relationship, offends against the sense of what is morally good, in these
contexts of personal relationship.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-004#13:1>
The key to an understanding of egoism lies in asking the question,
what area of human sensitivity it offends against.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-004#14:1>
Impersonalism, far from detecting what is morally offensive about
egoism, instead provides the grounds for legitimizing it.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-004#15:1>
Central to what I mean to say is a distinction which can be made, in
certain contexts of human relationship, between the personal and impersonal
points of view.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-004#16:1>
In the first section of this paper, I shall consider some
hypothetical examples to bring out the distinction and also the significance
of making it.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-004#17:1>
This stands in contrast to other contexts where no such distinction
can be made.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-004#18:1>
The resulting analysis will serve to illuminate the contrast which I
shall draw later, between an example of egoism ( Rosamond) an example
indicative of moral concern ( Dorothea).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-004#19:1>
<h> 1) Personal and Impersonal Points of View </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-004#20:1>
Suppose D is C's wife, and C sees his relationship with D in terms of
the duty which he has towards her and that what she does for him should be
viewed similarly as a fulfillment of the duty which she has towards him, as a
wife.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-004#21:1>
That means he sees D as occupying a role in relation to him which
entitles both of them to certain rights, and binds them to certain
responsibilities, vis-a-vis one another.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-004#22:1>
This impersonal conception of his relationship with D may well be in
order, from a third person perspective.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-004#23:1>
It is generally agreed, for example, that if a wife needs emotional
support, it is the husband's duty to provide it.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-004#24:1>
This may be subsumed under the universal principle, 'All husbands
ought to give their wives emotional support ( at such times when they need
it)'.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-004#25:1>
it is of course rather peculiar to describe the case like this, for
it is not as if the wife needs such support in the way she needs, say, goods
of some kind, nor is it the case that she needs support or comfort from
someone fitting the appellation of a husband.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-004#26:1>
For the nature of such support can only be manifested through, and be
expressive of, an intimately personal relationship between two individuals,
in this case, C and D.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-004#27:1>
But this observation itself serves to emphasise the following point.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-004#28:1>
If C, in response to his wife's emotional needs, at the same time
does or says anything to indicate that his action is determined by the
thought of 'what is to be expected of a husband', or 'what is due to a wife',
chances are that D would be hurt.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-004#29:1>
What would soothe her is not the thought that he is responding
because he is acting out his role as a husband, but the thought that his
action in comforting her is a response to her need for him.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-004#30:1>
C's response and general conception of his relation to D, on the
other hand, as the bearer of certain rights in respect of holding a certain
position, or as manifesting certain characteristics which call for treatment
of a certain sort, implies that he would treat D just as he would treat any
other person in D's position, who so happens to have that same relation to
him.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-004#31:1>
But such an impersonal conception of the relationship, held by a
participant in that relationship, does not presuppose that there is an
existing personal relationship in which there is care and concern, and
neither is it conducive towards establishing one.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-004#32:1>
We may better appreciate why this is so, when we consider the
characteristics of cases in which no essential difference of meaning exists
between the personal and the impersonal points of view.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-004#33:1>
( 1) A group of surgeons decide to operate on a patient who is
stricken with cancer.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-004#34:1>
His estimated chances of recovery after the surgery are good, and
there are no major difficulties anticipated for the operation itself.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-004#35:1>
The surgeons have performed the same kind of operation before, and
this particular case presents no relevant difference to make them feel overly
concerned.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-004#36:1>
There are certain standard technical procedures to follow, the broad
aim being of course, the patient's recovery.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-004#37:1>
This is more immediately and specifically described as to trace the
cancer, and to stop its growth.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-004#38:1>
This aim dictates the means to be taken, as given by the latest
medical knowledge.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-004#39:1>
The patient however, fails to get through the operation.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-004#40:1>
According to an independent assessor, the surgeons were competent and
technically speaking, the operation was a success, except that the patient's
heart failed to function at a critical stage of the operation.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-004#41:1>
This unforeseen event is classified under the category of 'technical
risks', and the surgeons therefore, are free from blame.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-004#42:1>
According to the standards and procedures set by the aim, they had
done their best.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-004#43:1>
This judgment is arrived at through an analysis of the steps taken to
secure the aim.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-004#44:1>
The impersonal judgment that they had done their best is no different
from their own belief that this was the case.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-004#45:1>
Should they have committed an error on the other hand, their judgment
( should they make it) that 'We did our best,' would be converted by the
analysis made on an impersonal basis, that 'They did not do their best'.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-004#46:1>
But although these two statements are contradictory, they belong
essentially to the same process of determination.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-004#47:1>
That is, the truth of the judgment may be determined according to the
requirements set by the aim.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-004#48:1>
The specific aim of stopping the disease gives a certain direction to
the means, and the notions of mistake and correctness may be determined
according to whether these directions were followed, and to what degree.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-004#49:1>
Note the contrast with what it is possible to say about the
wife-husband relationship.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-004#50:1>
If the husband, say, rushes home to comfort his wife because he
thinks, 'she needs me', instead of conceiving it as 'what is expected of a
husband', he is not contradicting this latter conception.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-004#51:1>
Not because they mean the same, nor does he deny that he has such a
duty.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-004#52:1>
Rather, his action is not determined by, or grounded upon, any such
conception and requirement, and there can be no contradiction where the
levels of determination are not the same.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-004#53:1>
To see this, suppose that through no fault of his, he arrives too
late and something has happened to his wife.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-004#54:1>
Let's say he feels utterly distraught and blames himself for this.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-004#55:1>
This is contradicted by others, for objectively speaking, he had
performed his duty by doing the best he could in coming.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-004#56:1>
His statement, 'I am to blame', however, is not to be seen from this
perspective of the failure to take the proper means towards fulfilling a
goal, because first of all, as we have just seen, there is no such failure.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-004#57:1>
Secondly, and more important, his statement of blame expresses the
significance of the relationship which he has with the individual who is his
wife.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-004#58:1>
It is, among other things, an expression of the commitment which he
has towards her.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-004#59:1>
Thus, even though from the impersonal point of view, he is not to
blame, his feeling that he is to blame indicates something about the meaning
and significance of the relationship, and there is no contradiction here.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-004#60:1>
Where there is no possibility of contradiction, neither is there a
possibility of concurrence.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-004#61:1>
The notion of 'blame' in this context, does not take its cue from
some external requirement or standard which would make it possible for
someone, as a spectator, to agree with him that he is personally to blame.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-004#62:1>
For, given the personal dimension in which he utters it, to so agree
would be a most callous thing to say.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-004#63:1>
( 2) The personal and impersonal distinction also has no essential
role to play, in an institutional context, as will be seen in the following
hypothetical example.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-004#64:1>
An accused, A, comes before a judge, to be tried for a crime.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-004#65:1>
The judge, after listening to the evidence, which makes it plain that
A is guilty of the crime, finds also that he is remorseful.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-004#66:1>
Formally speaking, remorse is not a criterion for passing a more
lenient sentence.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-004#67:1>
A's case is, in all relevant respects, similar to others involving
the same offence.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-004#68:1>
The rules governing the judge's decisions are institutional ones, and
his role is itself an institutional role.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-004#69:1>
Seeing himself as an impartial guardian of the law, he may rightly
feel that he ought not allow himself to be swayed by considerations which are
formally deemed irrelevant to the institutional aim of maintaining law and
order.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-004#70:1>
Thus, although he may personally think that justice would not really
be done, considering the fact that A is remorseful about his past action, he
may be forced, on institutional considerations, to sentence A, consistently
with other cases of a similar kind.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-004#71:1>
Some of these considerations may be for instance, the possibility
that should he pass a more lenient sentence on A, it may not help to deter
others from committing crimes of a similar nature, and the fact that should
he allow A's remorse to be considered relevant in passing sentence, it would
be difficult not to allow remorse to count in many other cases, bringing with
it the problem of deciding whether the remorse shown is spurious or not.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-004#72:1>
Or A's crime may be of such a serious nature that should he allow
remorse to influence his judgment, there will be censure both from the public
and his colleagues.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-004#73:1>
As in our example of the surgeons above, the ( institutional) aim of
maintaining law and order, in this context, directs that certain
considerations are relevant, and others irrelevant, in making a judgment.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-004#74:1>
No doubt in reality, judges are known to vary somewhat in the
judgments they make, perhaps because eof personal idiosyncrasies, but also
because the law does allow for personal discretion ( including the
consideration of remorse), in certain cases and within limits, in judgment.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-004#75:1>
nevertheless, the whole point of calling the aim institutional, and
the judge's role institutional, is that the form of his relationship to the
defendant and other members of the court, is guided by formalities set in
accordance with the law. <X>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-004#X76:1>
Thus, in passing judgment, it is not the judge personally as such,
who passes the judgment, but the judge, qua judge.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-004#X77:1>
Similarly, it is not A personally that he is passing judgment on,
but A as 'someone; who committed a certain crime and who merits being dealt
with in a certain way.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-004#X78:1>
No room exists therefore, in this context, for the kind of
distinction we have made in the wife-husband relationship.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-004#X79:1>
But once again, it points significantly to the need for such a
distinction, in the latter kind of context.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-004#X80:1>
It is said for instance of Casaubon, in Middlemarch, that for him, 'Marriage,
like erudition, nay, like authorship itself, was fated to become an outward
requirement, and Edward Casuabon was bent on fulfilling unimpeachably all
requirements.' In conceiving of his marriage, like everything else, as
imposing certain external requirements, Casaubon sees it as an institution
which he has joined, and whose membership requires that certain conditions be
fulfilled.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-004#X81:1>
If he does not fulfil them, then he is liable to reproach.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-004#X82:1>
On the other hand, if he does his part and plays his role as a
member by doing what is required of him, he would be blameless and
irreproachable.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-004#X83:1>
Just as the standards set up by the institution make one liable to
censure, these very same standards also protect one from censure.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-004#X84:1>
Casaubon's actions in this regard however, are the very expression
of insensitivity, and this is what forms a barrier between him and his wife,
Dorothea. </X> </I>
