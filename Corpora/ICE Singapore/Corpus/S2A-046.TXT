<I>

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-046#1:1:A>
First of all let me introduce myself and uh what we are here
for today

<ICE-SIN:S2A-046#2:1:A>
We are we will have a talk uhm

<ICE-SIN:S2A-046#3:1:A>
We will have a talk uhm with you and then this will this will be
followed by a video uh uh after the talk

<ICE-SIN:S2A-046#4:1:A>
And then I'll go through a couple of uh uh more detail on this
career talk

<ICE-SIN:S2A-046#5:1:A>
Uhm but first of all I'm Norman Lee

<ICE-SIN:S2A-046#6:1:A>
Uhm I'm a process manager in charge of one of the operating sections
in the Pulau Bukom refinery

<ICE-SIN:S2A-046#7:1:A>
Uhm uh what's the this talk will be all about I was uh told by my
Personnel Department a couple of days ago

<ICE-SIN:S2A-046#8:1:A>
Uhm and they actually ask for a couple of uh people a couple of
speakers uh indicating some senior people and some young people

<ICE-SIN:S2A-046#9:1:A>
I thought they were asking me as a a young person

<ICE-SIN:S2A-046#10:1:A>
But actually I was corrected very quickly on that especially now
notice all of you in front of me here is uh rather refreshing uh sight

<ICE-SIN:S2A-046#11:1:A>
Okay now uhm what the talk would uh consist of as I had mentioned
uh just now would be a a video uh presentation to start with in a couple of
seconds

<ICE-SIN:S2A-046#12:1:A>
Uh and then we will have a a bit of a a overhead slides after that

<ICE-SIN:S2A-046#13:1:A>
Und then we will have another young speaker a true young speaker to
come up and uh welcome question and answer questions

<ICE-SIN:S2A-046#14:1:A>
So if we can have the lights off please and then uh we can show the
video

<ICE-SIN:S2A-046#15:1:A>
That was the uh uh short introduction uhm

<ICE-SIN:S2A-046#16:1:A>
What I will try and do now is just to run through a couple of
<unclear> word </unclear> with all of you uhm to bring some details to uh
what was talked about during the video

<ICE-SIN:S2A-046#17:1:A>
Let me first introduce you to Shell Singapore

<ICE-SIN:S2A-046#18:1:A>
The Shell companies in Singapore is uh by any standards uh fairly
large uh companies

<ICE-SIN:S2A-046#19:1:A>
It has got uh six hundred uh senior staff

<ICE-SIN:S2A-046#20:1:A>
Uh this will be mainly uh graduate uh uh staff and a total of uh a
thou just under two thousand staff altogether

<ICE-SIN:S2A-046#21:1:A>
Uh in functional division uh in the Shell companies in Singapore
are made up of uh quite a number of uh diff different parts

<ICE-SIN:S2A-046#22:1:A>
In manufacturing the main facilities are all concentrated in the
Pulau Bukom refinery

<ICE-SIN:S2A-046#23:1:A>
What was said on the video uh just now is already a little bit out
of date in the sense that the Pulau Bukom refinery is the largest uh in the
whole Shell Group uh with the recent investment which some of you may have
seen in the news newspapers

<ICE-SIN:S2A-046#24:1:A>
Crude oil comes in from from all over from the Middle East from
Indonesia from East Malaysia and uh basically is refined in in a distillation
unit in a secondary conversion unit

<ICE-SIN:S2A-046#25:1:A>
A lot of it is very state of the art technology

<ICE-SIN:S2A-046#26:1:A>
Uh they are also state of the art technology when it comes to the
computer control

<ICE-SIN:S2A-046#27:1:A>
And uh the uh all the sophisticated uh data information systems
that we have got on on the refinery

<ICE-SIN:S2A-046#28:1:A>
Uh to support all of this manufacturing facility in on on the Pulau
Bukom vicinity are three main divisions

<ICE-SIN:S2A-046#29:1:A>
The engineering division the operational division and technology
division

<ICE-SIN:S2A-046#30:1:A>
Now as graduates uh you come in uh if you are in the uh civil
electrical mechanical uh discipline

<ICE-SIN:S2A-046#31:1:A>
Uhm then you will basically come in to work in one of the
engineering divisions

<ICE-SIN:S2A-046#32:1:A>
As chemical enigineers you will come in to work as technologists
who will be uh basically uh looking at uh improving efficiencies and so on

<ICE-SIN:S2A-046#33:1:A>
So the whole team you know these three main divisions on Pulau
Bukom serves to run the refinery in an efficient way to maintain the refinery

<ICE-SIN:S2A-046#34:1:A>
And also to look at all all sorts of new projects and new major
investments and so on

<ICE-SIN:S2A-046#35:1:A>
Then we come to chemicals

<ICE-SIN:S2A-046#36:1:A>
The uh chemicals team in uh in Singapore consist of uh selling and
manufacturing uh <unclear> word </unclear> intermediate <unclear> word
</unclear> for petrols for detergents and so on

<ICE-SIN:S2A-046#37:1:A>
Uhm we are in a state of uhm Asia Pacific expansion and uh the
chemical team is actually on a part of the growth uh market as a <unclear>
word </unclear>

<ICE-SIN:S2A-046#38:1:A>
The graduates uh joining chemicals in Shell would basically be put
very quickly into frontline uh development of uh <unclear> word </unclear>
market opportunities not only within Singapore but also in the region

<ICE-SIN:S2A-046#39:1:A>
So people will have to be travelling to our London factory to
develop markets and to look for opportunities <unclear> word </unclear> and
so on

<ICE-SIN:S2A-046#40:1:A>
Now uhm on marketing uh the marketing function uh in Shell
Singapore basically I mean all of you see the Shell petrol stations uh along
along the roads and so on

<ICE-SIN:S2A-046#41:1:A>
That is a large part of the uh marketing uh functions because
everything to do got to do with uh to go from petrol to diesel to uh L P G
and so on

<ICE-SIN:S2A-046#42:1:A>
And of course uh even uh detergents uhm and graduates who join us
in the marketing department

<ICE-SIN:S2A-046#43:1:A>
You will be basically running uh will be basically running to
portfolio customers industrial customers to give them support for their usage
of products

<ICE-SIN:S2A-046#44:1:A>
And also to develop new areas of uh trading and so on

<ICE-SIN:S2A-046#45:1:A>
Then we come to uh supply planning

<ICE-SIN:S2A-046#46:1:A>
Now supply planning is one of those uh activities that we have to
have which is mainly stages in the central offices in uh the uh the uh head
office in Shell Towers Raffles Place

<ICE-SIN:S2A-046#47:1:A>
Supply supply planning is very essential for ensuring the whole of
uh that whole of Bukom refinery is used to its optimum

<ICE-SIN:S2A-046#48:1:A>
So all sorts of uh <unclear> word </unclear> deals and products
deals are made in supply planning

<ICE-SIN:S2A-046#49:1:A>
And the the uh people there are also looking at how to optimise the
refinery

<ICE-SIN:S2A-046#50:1:A>
Now from the supply planning uh part one could actually jump into
the highly uh uh affective uh oil-trading uh uh area

<ICE-SIN:S2A-046#51:1:A>
Where you know after one has acted as uh market analyst in supply
planning you one can actually go into the tiny uh round-the-clock uh and and
very exciting world of oil-trading

<ICE-SIN:S2A-046#52:1:A>
Then we come to the personnel function

<ICE-SIN:S2A-046#53:1:A>
Shell places a lot of importance on in the human resources

<ICE-SIN:S2A-046#54:1:A>
So basically I mean the attention that we've given to making the
best out of the people that Shell has is given to the task

<ICE-SIN:S2A-046#55:1:A>
I mean it's given to the uh uh opportunity of the line managers

<ICE-SIN:S2A-046#56:1:A>
But to gauge and to help line managers in uh taking uh to
facilitate their functions the the personnel function comes in

<ICE-SIN:S2A-046#57:1:A>
Personnel function for those of us who are who are who have a a
inclination to actually to go into human relation

<ICE-SIN:S2A-046#58:1:A>
Uh and uh and and who would be very interactive with people the
personnel function also ex <unclear> word </unclear> extreme amount of
flexibility

<ICE-SIN:S2A-046#59:1:A>
Graduates joining us in the personnel function will actually go
into uh looking into compensation and job evaluations and and all those
little things behind the scene

<ICE-SIN:S2A-046#60:1:A>
We come to the finance functions

<ICE-SIN:S2A-046#61:1:A>
Of course I mean Shell uh being big the money is also big

<ICE-SIN:S2A-046#62:1:A>
And the money money money all over the place you have got to have a
whole bunch of accountants to look after the money to look after the oil to
look after the stock

<ICE-SIN:S2A-046#63:1:A>
So we have got management accounting we have got uh financial
accounting and so on so forth <unclear> word </unclear>

<ICE-SIN:S2A-046#64:1:A>
So that is the financial uh area and of course uh last and not
least in tune with the Singapore scene of information technology

<ICE-SIN:S2A-046#65:1:A>
Uh Shell is also having all the state-of-art system within its
within its uh environment

<ICE-SIN:S2A-046#66:1:A>
Uhm basically data-processing telecoms uh corporate system
everything becoming integrated <unclear> word </unclear> team and

<ICE-SIN:S2A-046#67:1:A>
A team refinery scheduling the oil-trading world would just run uh
with uh data at everyone's finger tips

<ICE-SIN:S2A-046#68:1:A>
So it is a big challenge in the realm of the information technology
area

<ICE-SIN:S2A-046#69:1:A>
I would like now like to touch uh to give you a first of all a
summary on the what a career in Shell will actually mean

<ICE-SIN:S2A-046#70:1:A>
I've given you a little bit of uhm uhm meat which you can take uh
your teeth on as far as the actual job content in the various part of the
company

<ICE-SIN:S2A-046#71:1:A>
But which ever job the person actually goes into uh in the company
there there there is a whole uh system of career planning uh within Shell

<ICE-SIN:S2A-046#72:1:A>
The opportunities in Shell as you may see from the size and the
expense of the company

<ICE-SIN:S2A-046#73:1:A>
I mean it being an international company opportunities for
personnel growth is uh tremendous

<ICE-SIN:S2A-046#74:1:A>
Uhm not only growth uh within uh Shell in Singapore but uh you know
to for assignments abroad the ability to travel

<ICE-SIN:S2A-046#75:1:A>
And opportunities to uh to actually get in touch with our
colleagues our foreign colleagues

<ICE-SIN:S2A-046#76:1:A>
The uh people who join Shell are given early responsibility

<ICE-SIN:S2A-046#77:1:A>
And and this we believe very we believe to be very important for
people to feel useful in their job right from the very start

<ICE-SIN:S2A-046#78:1:A>
Training we believe in training

<ICE-SIN:S2A-046#79:1:A>
We have a regional training uh facilities and we have also got uhm
overseas uh courses which we we send our graduates and also uh uh staff who
have got a certainly number of years to go on all these courses for personal
uh development

<ICE-SIN:S2A-046#80:1:A>
We have a a part of our regular uhm appraisal in order to let
people know how well they are doing

<ICE-SIN:S2A-046#81:1:A>
Uhm how how what should they be doing different in order to be
perform better in the company

<ICE-SIN:S2A-046#82:1:A>
Our whole our whole appraisal system is in place which uh gives
people feedback

<ICE-SIN:S2A-046#83:1:A>
Uh to tell the individual you know they could be from the line
management and they could be from personnel uhm what exactly you know they
can do to be improving themselves

<ICE-SIN:S2A-046#84:1:A>
I'll touch on this uh uh subject a little bit later and of course
the last subject which I'm sure I mean everybody is uh uh has part of their
priority the salary progression in Shell

<ICE-SIN:S2A-046#85:1:A>
Uh how would I say how would I put out put it <unclear> word
</unclear>

<ICE-SIN:S2A-046#86:1:A>
I mean the uh it is the <unclear> word </unclear> it the
performance related uh and potential related pay scale which I hope to touch
on a little bit after one or two slide

<ICE-SIN:S2A-046#87:1:A>
Now I've mentioned about uh career development uhm quite
specifically we talk about a graduate's progrssion uh development programme

<ICE-SIN:S2A-046#88:1:A>
And this is something that we find is extremely valuable for us
pushing uh graduates along the way when they're in the first couple years
with the company

<ICE-SIN:S2A-046#89:1:A>
We have uh we have the belief that it is important to spot talent
so that people who are coming in we like to know their of capabilities and as
early as possible

<ICE-SIN:S2A-046#90:1:A>
And in doing so we are then in a position to help the uh graduates
along their way

<ICE-SIN:S2A-046#91:1:A>
Their strengths will be emphasised and their weaknesses will be
addressed

<ICE-SIN:S2A-046#92:1:A>
And this whole uh uh scheme is basically set up to make use of
their potential uh and abilities

<ICE-SIN:S2A-046#93:1:A>
Now the uh features of this graduate development programme is that
every quarter every three months people will get assessed uh initially and
feedback will be given to the people

<ICE-SIN:S2A-046#94:1:A>
Uh and the and then training would actually be also falling in
place together with this uh assessment

<ICE-SIN:S2A-046#95:1:A>
Uh later on of course I mean the training would continue right
through the whole uh career

<ICE-SIN:S2A-046#96:1:A>
I talked about growth and development

<ICE-SIN:S2A-046#97:1:A>
We emphasise the exposure we like people to be actually exposed to
all sorts of different environments

<ICE-SIN:S2A-046#98:1:A>
We like people to have we like people to have changing jobs

<ICE-SIN:S2A-046#99:1:A>
So we are talking about people who actually go from job to job uh
within uh two to three years and we like people uh to have a broad outlook

<ICE-SIN:S2A-046#100:1:A>
Now all these beliefs are basically uh driving us to to expose
people by sending people around in the region by sending people overseas <X>

<ICE-SIN:S2A-046#X101:1:A>
And and this broad is broadens uh we call it broadening
development for people will basically put them in in uh positions for future
senior management Now I come to the uh perhaps the more meaty issue ah Before
the pause gets too long let me continue Uhm for the for graduates joining
Shell we talk about a a monthly salar salary of between two to two thousand
five hundred dollars That range would be decided upon uh you know various
circumstances like whether you've done N S or whether you are uhm uh whether
you are whether you are a trained in a certain way or another </X> </I>
