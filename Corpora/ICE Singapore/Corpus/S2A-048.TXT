<ICE-SIN:S2A-048#1:1:A>
Thank you uh Annie

<ICE-SIN:S2A-048#2:1:A>
Uhm I'm sure you'll all agree with me that uh Doctor Annie Koh has
prepared us so well

<ICE-SIN:S2A-048#3:1:A>
Uh in her presentation that the task for the uh resource persons
were made very much easier

<ICE-SIN:S2A-048#4:1:A>
When I started discussing with my group I used the handout which uh
Doctor Annie Koh uh circulated

<ICE-SIN:S2A-048#5:1:A>
We started with uh question one

<ICE-SIN:S2A-048#6:1:A>
I uh asked the group to consider question one and from which we said
we will then go on to the other questions

<ICE-SIN:S2A-048#7:1:A>
As we started on question one we went along and then gradually we
found that uh we were moving into so many areas and I lost track of time

<ICE-SIN:S2A-048#8:1:A>
Which which means that uhm I have not been quite uh uh uh a very
good facilitator in that way uh

<ICE-SIN:S2A-048#9:1:A>
I lost track of time and before we knew we had only fifteen minutes
for tea

<ICE-SIN:S2A-048#10:1:A>
So I'll just uh uh summarise a little bit of uh the just the key
points that uh my faculty uh has raised they have raised in our discussions

<ICE-SIN:S2A-048#11:1:A>
A lot of the use of small groups I think uh will there'll be a lot
of overlaps uh amongst faculties

<ICE-SIN:S2A-048#12:1:A>
So what I will uh concentrate upon is uh the use of small groups in
clinical teaching in the Faculty of Medicine

<ICE-SIN:S2A-048#13:1:A>
Essentially uh four there are four areas uh in which small groups
uh can be used

<ICE-SIN:S2A-048#14:1:A>
One is in the to try and develop practice practical skills in uh
the examination of patients uh not in the at this stage in the first stage
not actually examining the patient as such

<ICE-SIN:S2A-048#15:1:A>
But uh being taught by the tutor how the procedure can take place
and so forth

<ICE-SIN:S2A-048#16:1:A>
Uh here a group of size of about six uh is considered uh to be
about optimum

<ICE-SIN:S2A-048#17:1:A>
The other area in which small groups are used uhm will be in taking
the history of patients analysing the history and so forth

<ICE-SIN:S2A-048#18:1:A>
Uh what they call uh clucking <unclear> word </unclear> skills you
cluck your patients and this is where again uh small groups would be very
useful uh to carry on this educational exercise

<ICE-SIN:S2A-048#19:1:A>
And then the other the next area is one of the uh clinical case
studies where you look at actual uh not actual you you you're presented with
a a problem uh say asthma or high blood pressure and so forth and you then
discuss with your groups

<ICE-SIN:S2A-048#20:1:A>
Now of course uh this first three that which I've mentioned they
are they cover more or less the the same uh requirements that one would want
for small groups in I think other areas of teaching as well

<ICE-SIN:S2A-048#21:1:A>
And the last area which I'm going to mention is in the actual
examination of patients

<ICE-SIN:S2A-048#22:1:A>
This is where we had a lot of discussion and some were very
entertaining

<ICE-SIN:S2A-048#23:1:A>
Uhm here in the case of actual examination of patients uh it was
brought out very clearly that very important is that small group here means
really very small groups uh where it boils down to only one or two students
uh to the patient

<ICE-SIN:S2A-048#24:1:A>
The problems of course uh as I mention it I'm sure it'll become
obvious to you uh patients cannot be inconvenienced too much with too many uh
students looking down at them

<ICE-SIN:S2A-048#25:1:A>
And a particular our colleague in Obstetrics and Gynecology brought
out a particular problem in that when you are examining uh <unclear> word
</unclear> it becomes very very difficult for particularly male students
examining female students

<ICE-SIN:S2A-048#26:1:A>
So this is an area where uh small group really means very small
group

<ICE-SIN:S2A-048#27:1:A>
Uh you can afford to have twenty uhm students uh looking uh uh at
patients and uh looking at the same patient over and over again

<ICE-SIN:S2A-048#28:1:A>
Uh here this applies equally well to Dentistry because you're
looking at the other <unclear> word </unclear> which is uh not very big you
know uh

<ICE-SIN:S2A-048#29:1:A>
So you can't have uh too many patients uh uh students uh looking in
that small little area

<ICE-SIN:S2A-048#30:1:A>
So our colleagues in Dentistry uh also reflected that they have the
same problem and there in uh lies the uh use of very small groups

<ICE-SIN:S2A-048#31:1:A>
Uh in addition to what I've said uh there are there were some
suggestions as to how we could try and reduce this the use of patients to a
minimum

<ICE-SIN:S2A-048#32:1:A>
Uhm one of which is uh to try and use close circuit T V of various
procedures

<ICE-SIN:S2A-048#33:1:A>
And our colleague in Optomology uh uh mention two uh uh uh uhm ways
that they go about this

<ICE-SIN:S2A-048#34:1:A>
One is they use audio-visual aids

<ICE-SIN:S2A-048#35:1:A>
They use actual slides of eye conditions actual slides of pa taken
from patients

<ICE-SIN:S2A-048#36:1:A>
They also of course have a problem because very often in an eye
examination there is a a a a small light source uh you know into the eye of
the patient

<ICE-SIN:S2A-048#37:1:A>
You cannot have too many students looking around like that

<ICE-SIN:S2A-048#38:1:A>
So they try to overcome uh uh as best as they can while it is not a
replacement for actual patient examination it becomes uh uh uh it complements

<ICE-SIN:S2A-048#39:1:A>
And it hopefully you can then reduce the need to expose the student
uh to uh to too many patient examinations

<ICE-SIN:S2A-048#40:1:A>
So they use audio-visual aids either slides of actual condition eye
conditions

<ICE-SIN:S2A-048#41:1:A>
Or they also have uh close circuit T V whereby the surgeon is
actually operating uh the students are watching the operation on T V and the
surgeon is in communication

<ICE-SIN:S2A-048#42:1:A>
So there is possibility of crosstalk even while the operation is
going on

<ICE-SIN:S2A-048#43:1:A>
Now the other point that emerged from our discussions is that here
unlike the use of small groups in uh uh other situations

<ICE-SIN:S2A-048#44:1:A>
This is actually an a real situation where the teacher is himself
uh being observed by the student every moment of his how he relates to the
patient how he communicates with the patient is now in fact being observed by
his students

<ICE-SIN:S2A-048#45:1:A>
And this is where our colleagues felt that this is a situation
where teachers can provide that inspiration and provide or or make himself
the role model

<ICE-SIN:S2A-048#46:1:A>
We also have heard of uh failures towards this direction

<ICE-SIN:S2A-048#47:1:A>
We have heard of cases where teachers have excel as role models

<ICE-SIN:S2A-048#48:1:A>
So these are some our problems and uh uh uh the users of uh small
groups in the clinical setting

<ICE-SIN:S2A-048#49:1:A>
We concluded by uh drawing attention to one point and that is that
if we are talking about small groups then we should totally avoid using it as
a mini lecture

<ICE-SIN:S2A-048#50:1:A>
We consider it a sin uh to use small groups and then making it into
a mini lecture

<ICE-SIN:S2A-048#51:1:A>
And uh we think that you shouldn't earn your salary if that's the
case

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-048#52:1:B>
Thank you Prof Gwee

<ICE-SIN:S2A-048#53:1:B>
Oh dear I think my salary have been halved already

<ICE-SIN:S2A-048#54:1:B>
Okay uh Prof Yong will now address us

<ICE-SIN:S2A-048#55:1:B>
I'm going to keep the questions till after all the panelists have
the chance to voice their opinions first

<ICE-SIN:S2A-048#56:1:B>
Prof

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-048#57:1:C>
Right thank you

<ICE-SIN:S2A-048#58:1:C>
Uh good morning ladies and gentlemen

<ICE-SIN:S2A-048#59:1:C>
Uh first uh what I learn from this morning uh is that uh have to
provide a road map before you start something

<ICE-SIN:S2A-048#60:1:C>
So within the five minutes that I'm allocated I'll spend the first
minute on telling what is the scope of our discussion

<ICE-SIN:S2A-048#61:1:C>
Three minutes on what we actually discussed and one minute to wind
it up

<ICE-SIN:S2A-048#62:1:C>
Now uh actually originally uh at least from the resource person
point of view I plan to actually focus on a few topics that uh Annie has so
kindly drafted up in in in in a short write up

<ICE-SIN:S2A-048#63:1:C>
But later on the participant felt that uh we should just
concentrate on the essence of what small group teaching really is

<ICE-SIN:S2A-048#64:1:C>
And uh what we have is that it's remarkable that we have a
consensus of opinion within the different departments on actually the
problems that we are facing in the Engineering Faculty

<ICE-SIN:S2A-048#65:1:C>
Uh originally the definition for small group teaching we thought we
could actually expand it to include uh uh uh lectures with a small numbers of
students as well as tutorial

<ICE-SIN:S2A-048#66:1:C>
But uh again we somehow converge to tutorials so really when we now
think about small group teaching somehow uh we we are thinking more of
tutorials

<ICE-SIN:S2A-048#67:1:C>
Now the consensus is that uh we have uh unfortunately an unhealthy
practice in the Engine Faculty in the sense that the our our tutorial perhaps
are slightly different from the way tutorials are conducted perhaps in the
other faculties like Arts and Social

<ICE-SIN:S2A-048#68:1:C>
Uh the reason is being technical

<ICE-SIN:S2A-048#69:1:C>
The a lot of cases involves problem-solving and uh somehow the
comments from most of the participants is that the because they are
problem-solving uh tutors tend to set deterministic problem

<ICE-SIN:S2A-048#70:1:C>
In other words these are basically closed end solutions

<ICE-SIN:S2A-048#71:1:C>
And as a result the what the students does is that uh they'll just
probably go up to the board write out the solutions and if the solutions are
okay no comment

<ICE-SIN:S2A-048#72:1:C>
If the solution is not okay the tutor will then start to ask
questions

<ICE-SIN:S2A-048#73:1:C>
Perhaps his uh his uh own colleagues or students will also ask
questions

<ICE-SIN:S2A-048#74:1:C>
But we felt that that is not a healthy practice

<ICE-SIN:S2A-048#75:1:C>
Uh the real world outside basically is not so deterministic uh it
is more on tackling open-ended issues which involves a lot of disciplines

<ICE-SIN:S2A-048#76:1:C>
But we felt that we are hampered by the by the fact that uh seems
to be in the system and partly the teachers ourselves are responsible for
this system in the sense that from the day year one we give them sets out of
uh problems with set answers

<ICE-SIN:S2A-048#77:1:C>
Occasionally with uh solutions given and these are more or less
targeted towards an examinated an examination oriented system

<ICE-SIN:S2A-048#78:1:C>
In other words we provide tutorials to the examination as an end

<ICE-SIN:S2A-048#79:1:C>
And we thought that again that is an unhealthy practice

<ICE-SIN:S2A-048#80:1:C>
And the problem also compounded by the fact that we have teaching
evaluation at Engineering Faculty

<ICE-SIN:S2A-048#81:1:C>
And that if the tutor are not do not give the exam give model
answers or solutions or to give lecture notes to supplement he'll get a poor
grading in his in an evaluation

<ICE-SIN:S2A-048#82:1:C>
Uh so the practice in the first year is such that the uh lecture
notes are given to students

<ICE-SIN:S2A-048#83:1:C>
Uh tutorial solutions are given to the extent certain cases model
answers are also given

<ICE-SIN:S2A-048#84:1:C>
And the net result is that these text compounded year after year
even when they reach final-year students who are about to graduate

<ICE-SIN:S2A-048#85:1:C>
They are still un answering for lecture notes model answers and
this is what we find uh something unhealthy

<ICE-SIN:S2A-048#86:1:C>
Now we have uh come up with the problems but uh by the time we have
discussed the problems we don't we the time was up we we didn't have much
time to look in the solution

<ICE-SIN:S2A-048#87:1:C>
But uh what they generally agreed is that this has to be brought up
the the philosophy of the the system of conducting tutorial in the faculty
has to change

<ICE-SIN:S2A-048#88:1:C>
So at this point I can only reassure the participants that the
matter we'll bring it up to the our own faculty teaching methodology
committee and also to the faculty administration and we'll what can be done

<ICE-SIN:S2A-048#89:1:C>
So on hindsight at least uh this seminar has brought out some some
note uh significant problem uh that we face in the faculty

<ICE-SIN:S2A-048#90:1:C>
Now we have another minor problem was brought up towards the end
and that was the how do we uh allow how do we prevent students from choosing
their tutorial groups

<ICE-SIN:S2A-048#91:1:C>
In other words again the Engineering Faculty we assign our students
to certain tutorial groups so they may be something like uh ten tutorial
groups with ten different lecturers

<ICE-SIN:S2A-048#92:1:C>
And we notice that some students they just move around tutorial
groups in preference of certain lecturers

<ICE-SIN:S2A-048#93:1:C>
And of course again this is an unhealthy uh <X>

<ICE-SIN:S2A-048#X94:1:C>
In certain departments we take attendance to make sure that the
students stay within the group in certain departments they do not follow
Again this is a practice that perhaps we we we need probably more time or or
maybe some other workshops to resolve this itself Uh that didn't leave much
time to to talk anything further It was still general we we however are
fortunate we focus on something that the that the rest of the departments
actually have the same problem and as I said this uh so in summary basically
the problem is one on on the conduct of the tutorial itself and of the
expectation of students to expect model answers and handout and the most
important is that we'll like to change our tutorial from a deterministic kind
of problemsolving to a more open-ended thinking and this is uh I presume that
is the theme of of what Annie Koh has tried to say in in the very first
lecture </X> </I>
