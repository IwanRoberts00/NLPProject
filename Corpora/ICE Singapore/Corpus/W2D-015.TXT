<h> Starting an orchid collection </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2D-015#6:1>
Before starting to grow orchids, it would be useful to talk to people
who have experience in orchid growing.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-015#7:1>
Some orchids are easier to grow than others and they flower more
freely.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-015#8:1>
Dendrobiums, for example, are rather robust and less susceptible to
bacterial attacks than Phalaenopsises.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-015#9:1>
The Arandas and Ascocendas are free-flowering.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-015#10:1>
Care must be taken to choose plants which fit your home environment.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-015#11:1>
The conditions in HDB flats or condominiums will be drier and shadier
than those in gardens or nurseries.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-015#12:1>
The duration and direction of sunshine are important considerations
for home orchid growing.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-015#13:1>
According to many orchid growers, there are four basic rules to
observe for growing orchids well:

<ICE-SIN:W2D-015#14:1>
1) Purchase only good healthy plants.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-015#15:1>
2) House them adequately.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-015#16:1>
3) Water and feed them correctly.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-015#17:1>
4) Protect them from pests and diseases.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-015#18:1>
<h> Growing orchids in pots </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2D-015#19:1>
Orchids can be grown in orchid pots and wooden baskets.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-015#20:1>
Orchid pots have holes in the bottom as well as at the sides.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-015#21:1>
Wooden baskets are commonly used for growing strap-leaved Vandas and
Ascocendas.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-015#22:1>
Special pots are used for the cultivation of Phalaenopsises .

<ICE-SIN:W2D-015#23:1>
Well-built, hard and symmetrical charcoal and/ or red brick are the
main potting media for epi phytic orchids.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-015#24:1>
These are broken up with a hammer into chips.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-015#25:1>
The size of the charcoal or brick chip depends on the size of the
plant and pot.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-015#26:1>
Plants with finer roots ( Oncidiums and Dendrobiums) grow better in
pieces of charcoal or brick ( 1-2 cm across) which provide better retention
of water and nutrients.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-015#27:1>
However with time, this may result in poorer aeration.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-015#28:1>
To ensure better aeration, place larger pieces of bricks or charcoal
at the bottom of the pot.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-015#29:1>
When charcoal is used, it is useful to place a few pieces of red
brick on top of the charcoal when plants are grown under full sunlight.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-015#30:1>
Charcoal absorbs light readily and the surface temperature of
charcoal may rise above 40C by noon.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-015#31:1>
The red colour of the brick chips tends to reflect away the infrared
rays, the source of the heat.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-015#32:1>
( This is why traditionally, roofing tiles are reddish).

<ICE-SIN:W2D-015#33:1>
All potted orchids require a dry environment around the roots between
watering so the medium must be well-drained.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-015#34:1>
For potting monopodial orchids ( Arandas, Arachnises, Arantheras,
Holttumaras, Mokaras and Vandas), the cutting is first placed at the centre
of the pot.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-015#35:1>
Plants with at least two aerial roots are used for planting.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-015#36:1>
The bricks and/ or charcoal chips are then filled in around the
cutting, the larger chips at the bottom with progressively smaller ones at
the top of the pot.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-015#37:1>
If the cutting is heavy, then use more bricks which can anchor it
better.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-015#38:1>
Charcoal is less dense.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-015#39:1>
Sympodial orchids such as Dendrobiums and Oncidiums are planted with
the oldest pseudo bulb close to the side of the pot and the newest pseudobulb
facing the centre of the pot.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-015#40:1>
This will provide ample space for the new pseudobulb to grow.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-015#41:1>
When planting sympodial orchids, use plants with at least two
backbulbs.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-015#42:1>
The more psuedobulbs, the more food reserves available to the clump
for new growth and recovery is faster.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-015#43:1>
Generally, orchids are repotted every three years or when the roots
have overgrown their pots.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-015#44:1>
Freshly repotted plants are kept away from rain and strong sunlight.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-015#45:1>
Orchids, like other plants, require sunlight to manufacture their own
food.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-015#46:1>
Generally, orchids can be divided into three major groups according
to their light requirements - shade, ( 50% full sunlight),partial shade (
70-80% full sunglight) and full sunlight ( 100%) Arachnises Arandas,
Arantheras Holttumaras, Mokaras and terete and semi-terete Vandas grow well
under full sunlight; strapped leaved Vandas and Phalawnopsises are more
shade-loving; endrobriums and Oncidiums grow well under partial shade.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-015#47:1>
<h> Watering </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2D-015#48:1>
Watering can be too little, too much or the right amount.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-015#49:1>
Orchids are often killed by excessive watering rather than by too
little watering.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-015#50:1>
If the leaves are dull looking and the bottom leaves drying and
dropping off, these are signs that the plants have been receiving too little
water.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-015#51:1>
Excessive watering encourages fungal and bacterial infection.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-015#52:1>
Also, leaves become yellowish and weak, showing signs of starvation
because the roots are not growing well.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-015#53:1>
New growth of roots is a good sign to note whether your orchids are
growing well.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-015#54:1>
In Singapore, water the plant at least once a day.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-015#55:1>
<h> Fertilizers </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2D-015#56:1>
Orchids, like all other green plants, require both the trace and
major elements.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-015#57:1>
An adequate supply of these elements in the form of fertilizers is
essential for the healthy growth of orchid plants.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-015#58:1>
Fertilizers such as Gaviota 63 or 67, Welgrow, Hyponex and
Nitrophoska are commonly used.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-015#59:1>
Most of these fertilizers contain the three major elements nitrogen (
N), phosphorus ( P) and potassium ( K) in different proportions and some
trace elements.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-015#60:1>
Gaviota 63 has an NPK ratio of 21: 21: 21 whereas Gaviota 67 has a
ratio of 14: 27: 27.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-015#61:1>
In general, a high nitrogen content favours vegetative growth and
large quantities of potassium and phosphorous encourage flowering.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-015#62:1>
It is a good practice to supply the orchids with lower dosage of
fertilizers at more frequent intervals.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-015#63:1>
This will avoid excessive accumulation of nutrients in the potting
media and wastage of fertilizer.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-015#64:1>
One should never exceed the recommended dosage.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-015#65:1>
Extra fertilizers will not make plants grow faster but may kill them
Instead!

<ICE-SIN:W2D-015#66:1>
When using chemical fertilizers, it is important to dissolve the
fertilizer completely before use.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-015#67:1>
If not, the crystals may be deposited on the leaves or roots and
cause burn and injury to the plant.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-015#68:1>
The solution can then be sprayed on the leaves and roots.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-015#69:1>
It is a common practice to apply fertilizers in the late afternoon
when the sun has gone down.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-015#70:1>
The droplets of fertilizers on the leaves can act as small lenses to
concentrate the light and the heat of the sun's rays and cause burn if one
sprays during the late morning or noon.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-015#71:1>
Organic fertilizers may also be applied to a plant.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-015#72:1>
These are usually derived from chicken dung or bat and bird guano (
droppings) and applied at the rate of a teaspoonful per pot every few months.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-015#73:1>
Needless to say, follow the recommendations given in the
instructions.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-015#74:1>
This has the advantage of breaking down slowly and providing a
sustained supply of nutrients over a period of time.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-015#75:1>
Initially growth is vigorous after application.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-015#76:1>
However, organic fertilizers tend to have an odour and ultimately
break down to close up the potting medium leading to poor drainage and root
rot.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-015#77:1>
<h> Pests and diseases </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2D-015#78:1>
In this section, we have only provided brief descriptions.

No 1. <h> Diseases of orchids in Singapore </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2D-015#88:1>
Orchids like other plants are attacked by various kinds of pests and
diseases.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-015#89:1>
The attacks occur when plants are grown under the best cultural
conditions.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-015#90:1>
Common pests in orchid cultivation include the insects ( scale,
mealy-bugs, yellow beetle, caterpillars, thrips) and the non-insects ( red
spider mite, snails and slugs).

<ICE-SIN:W2D-015#91:1>
Orchids can be infected by bacteria, fungi and viruses.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-015#92:1>
The most common orchid fungal disease anthracnose ( caused by
Colletotrichum species or Cloeosporium species) and flower blight ( Fusarium
moniliforme), crown rot ( Phytophthora palmivora) and basal rot ( Sclerotium
rolfsii).

<ICE-SIN:W2D-015#93:1>
Leaf spot caused by Cercospora species appears to be confined to
Dendrobiums.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-015#94:1>
The first symptom of an anthracnose infection is the presence of one
or more yellowish brown lesions ( well-defined or circumscribed abnormal
region) in the leaf.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-015#95:1>
The lesions enlarge with time and turn dark brown.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-015#96:1>
Crown rot ( black rot) first appears as a small watery brown spot on
the lower leaf surface.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-015#97:1>
It spreads and attacks the growing tip, causing a tip die back.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-015#98:1>
Root rot ( basal rot) follows after infection of the roots or basal
part of the stem.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-015#99:1>
Oncidiums are highly susceptible to basal rot.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-015#100:1>
Bacterial rot is common in Phalaenopsises, particularly during the
rainy season.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-015#101:1>
A high percentage of orchids are infected with diseases such as
Cymbidium mosaic virus and Odontoglossom ringspot virus disease.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-015#102:1>
Virus diseases are incurable at this time.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-015#103:1>
To destroy the virus one has to destroy the plant by burning or auto
claving ( pressure cook at a pressure of I kg cm2 for 15 minutes).

<ICE-SIN:W2D-015#104:1>
Even purchasing certified virus-free will not ensure that they stay
virus-free forever.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-015#105:1>
The only hope is in the long term when plant breeders and
pathologists develop virus-resistant plants.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-015#106:1>
If the virus-infected plants do not show adverse symptoms or
weakening, then one can still cultivate the plant, especially if the flowers
are not affected.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-015#107:1>
Pests and diseases in orchids except virus disease, can be
controlled by the use of appropriate insecticides, bactericides or
fungicides.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-015#108:1>
It is beyond the scope of this book to describe in detail the
various pests and diseases that attack the orchids and the control measures.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-015#109:1>
In management of pests and diseases, prevention is always better
than cure.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-015#110:1>
It is a good practice to keep the place well ventilated and clean.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-015#111:1>
Remove all dead leaves or infected plant parts.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-015#112:1>
Keep a constant watch for pests and diseases and speedy eradication
certainly helps.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-015#113:1>
When spraying with pesticides ( acaricides, insecticides,
bactericides or fungicides), take care not to get any spray onto flowers and
buds but make sure both sides of leaves are sprayed.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-015#114:1>
It is unwise to mix the various pesticides unless they are known for
certain to be compatible.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-015#115:1>
They may react to produce compounds that are very poisonous and kill
or injure the plants.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-015#116:1>
Needless to say, extreme care should be exercised in using any
pesticide, particularly acaricides or insecticides in flats and homes,
because they are mostly nerve-poisons.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-015#117:1>
Nerve-poisons can kill anything with nerves and this includes pet
dogs, Cats, rabbits, hamsters, birds, fish and ourselves!

<ICE-SIN:W2D-015#118:1>
<h> INCREASING THE VASE-LIFE OF CUT-FLOWERS </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2D-015#119:1>
A flower, be it rose, carnation or orchid will fade faster when it
is removed from the parent plant.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-015#120:1>
This is natural because upon excision, the supply of water and food
to the flower is severed.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-015#121:1>
The hormonal balance is also affected.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-015#122:1>
All these will accelerate the processes of senescence ( aging) of
the flower leading its death.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-015#123:1>
The keeping quality of a cut-flower depends on the growth
conditions of the plant ( preharvest factor) as well as the handling of the
flower after harvest ( postharvest factor).

<ICE-SIN:W2D-015#124:1>
As we have no idea of the preharvest condition of the flower when we
buy the flowers from the florist, we will only look into some of the
postharvest handling procedures which will help us to improve the keeping
quality of the cut-flower.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-015#125:1>
Adequate water uptake through the cut inf]orescence stalk Wilting of
flowers in an infloresence occurs when the water loss exceeds uptake.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-015#126:1>
Under normal conditions, water is supplied to the flower
continuously through the xylem.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-015#127:1>
Transport of water through the water-conducting vascular tissues (
xylem) in the inflorescence stalk is reduced as a result of vascular blockage
( xylem blockage).

<ICE-SIN:W2D-015#128:1>
Vascular blockage can be physical or physiological and or caused by
bacterial growth.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-015#129:1>
To prevent vascular blockage by air, it is advisable to recut the
florescence stalk under water after the inflorescence is brought back home.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-015#130:1>
If one cuts the stalk in the air, air bubbles might get into the
tissues and block further flow of water up the stalk.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-015#131:1>
Incluslon of chemicals or bactericides in the water of the vase will
prevent microbial growth.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-015#132:1>
Asprin, in small quantities, for example, has been reported to
extend the vase-life of cut-flowers.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-015#133:1>
Alternatively, one can recut the flower stalk every 2-3 days to
remove any possible vascular blockage from dying tissue or bacterial growth.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-015#134:1>
To increase the absorptive surface, cut the stem at a slant.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-015#135:1>
Do not immerse the infloresence stalk fully to ensure an adequate
oxygen supply to the cut stalk as water contains less oxygen than air. <X>

<ICE-SIN:W2D-015#X136:1>
If one does so, the stalk dies and rots quickly.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-015#X137:1>
<h> Adequate food supply for the cut-flower </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2D-015#X138:1>
Sugars serve as a major food and energy source for flowers.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-015#X139:1>
Therefore, the supply of sugar in the vase solution is critical for
the extension of the vase-life of the flowers.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-015#X140:1>
Generally, sugar is supplied in 1-2 % of the solution ( 1-2 gm in
100 ml of tap water).

<ICE-SIN:W2D-015#X141:1>
However, the addition of sugar to the vase solution without
bactericides may invite bacterial growth, and sometimes ants.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-015#X142:1>
Frequent changing of the solution in the vase is thus, desirable.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-015#X143:1>
Minimize the exposure of cut-flowers to ethylene. </X> </I>
