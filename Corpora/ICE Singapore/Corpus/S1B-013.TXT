<ICE-SIN:S1B-013#1:1:A>
Uhm you can collect them

<ICE-SIN:S1B-013#2:1:A>
Settle down okay and let's begin

<ICE-SIN:S1B-013#3:1:A>
Tay Seow Ming shocked at your marks is it

<ICE-SIN:S1B-013#4:1:A>
Okay let's begin

<ICE-SIN:S1B-013#5:1:A>
Good morn uh good afternoon class

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-013#6:1:B>
<O> greetings </O>

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-013#7:1:A>
Sit down alright

<ICE-SIN:S1B-013#8:1:A>
Now what we will do today for the first half hour or so is I want to
uhm go through the answers alright for the assignment questions that are
given to you okay

<ICE-SIN:S1B-013#9:1:A>
You all settle down please

<ICE-SIN:S1B-013#10:1:A>
Alright the first assignment question was question five c

<ICE-SIN:S1B-013#11:1:A>
Okay I think most of you manage to do this question but some of you
well I don't know what to say here ah but anyway this is the answer right

<ICE-SIN:S1B-013#12:1:A>
Now in the question five c you were asked whether a precipitate
will form when the pH of a point 01 mole per dm cube solution of magnesium
chloride is adjusted to ten

<ICE-SIN:S1B-013#13:1:A>
Now in the previous tutorial I gave you this hint right

<ICE-SIN:S1B-013#14:1:A>
The hint the key word is supposed to be pH ten

<ICE-SIN:S1B-013#15:1:A>
That means your solution is alkaline

<ICE-SIN:S1B-013#16:1:A>
Alkaline meaning that there is an excess of OH minus for hydroxide
ion so you have to calculate your concentration of hydroxide ion alright and
you do this using your POH value okay

<ICE-SIN:S1B-013#17:1:A>
So your concentration for hydroxide will be ten to the power minus
four mole per dm cube

<ICE-SIN:S1B-013#18:1:A>
Now why are you interested in this hydroxide ion concentration
because there's a possibility that your NG two plus that comes from your
magnesium chloride and your hydroxide can come together to form your white
solid magnesium hydroxide as a precipitate okay

<ICE-SIN:S1B-013#19:1:A>
Right so you are not concerned about magnesium chloride your
concentration of chloride ions

<ICE-SIN:S1B-013#20:1:A>
You're more concerned about these two okay

<ICE-SIN:S1B-013#21:1:A>
So you have a concentration of hydroxide

<ICE-SIN:S1B-013#22:1:A>
You have a concentration of <unclear> word </unclear>

<ICE-SIN:S1B-013#23:1:A>
So what you do is you calculate the ionic product okay

<ICE-SIN:S1B-013#24:1:A>
Uhm some mistakes are you forgot to raise your OH minus expression
to the power of two okay

<ICE-SIN:S1B-013#25:1:A>
Now anyway your ionic product will be this value which far exceeds
your solubility product of magnesium hydroxide

<ICE-SIN:S1B-013#26:1:A>
Therefore you can compute that uh precipitate <unclear> word
</unclear> four okay

<ICE-SIN:S1B-013#27:1:A>
So for question five c right you cannot say that since magnesium
chloride is a soluble salt no precipitate formed

<ICE-SIN:S1B-013#28:1:A>
You have to bear uhm bear in mind that it is an alkaline solution
alright

<ICE-SIN:S1B-013#29:1:A>
Any questions

<ICE-SIN:S1B-013#30:1:A>
No

<ICE-SIN:S1B-013#31:1:A>
Okay question six question six right uhm for this one what you have
is a saturated solution of hydrogen sulphide alright

<ICE-SIN:S1B-013#32:1:A>
Now you are given a specific concentration of metal ion and a
specific concentration of hydrochloric acid okay

<ICE-SIN:S1B-013#33:1:A>
So your metal ion it's concentration equals to one mole per dm cube
alright

<ICE-SIN:S1B-013#34:1:A>
Now your concentration of hydrochloric acid because this is a
strong acid it will completely dissociate

<ICE-SIN:S1B-013#35:1:A>
So this will be equivalent to the amount of H plus that is present
in solution which is zero point two five mole per dm cube okay

<ICE-SIN:S1B-013#36:1:A>
Right

<ICE-SIN:S1B-013#37:1:A>
Now what we have to do then is to calculate the sulphide ion
concentration

<ICE-SIN:S1B-013#38:1:A>
You don't know how much of it there is

<ICE-SIN:S1B-013#39:1:A>
So what you have to do is you write up the expression okay that has
been given to you you can copy this from your tutorial alright

<ICE-SIN:S1B-013#40:1:A>
Now some of you make careless mistakes here you forgot to square
your expression

<ICE-SIN:S1B-013#41:1:A>
Right it's been given to you that it's H plus whole thing squared
but you didn't do that right

<ICE-SIN:S1B-013#42:1:A>
Now what value do you substitute inside since the majority of your
H plus comes from your HCL you use point two five mole per dm cube okay

<ICE-SIN:S1B-013#43:1:A>
Right

<ICE-SIN:S1B-013#44:1:A>
Now from this you can solve for your sulphide ion concentration

<ICE-SIN:S1B-013#45:1:A>
Right the value is one point seven six plus ten to the power of
minus twenty-two mole per dm cube alright

<ICE-SIN:S1B-013#46:1:A>
Now the next thing that is of concern to you will the ionic product
alright exceed the Ksp for your metal sulphide or will it be less than okay

<ICE-SIN:S1B-013#47:1:A>
Because if it is less than there will be no precipitation okay

<ICE-SIN:S1B-013#48:1:A>
If it is greater than then a precipitate will form

<ICE-SIN:S1B-013#49:1:A>
Now it's necessary that you put these two statements down whether
it's greater than or it's less than alright

<ICE-SIN:S1B-013#50:1:A>
You cannot straight-away cons uh uhm conclude oh the ionic product
is equal to a particular value that's all therefore such and such will
precipitate out and such and such will not precipitate out

<ICE-SIN:S1B-013#51:1:A>
Okay you must give me the inequality signs here so that at least I
know you understand what you're working out and that you did not copy from
somebody else alright

<ICE-SIN:S1B-013#52:1:A>
Some of you had very obvious copying uh Okay next time try to copy
more intelligently modify your answers slightly

<ICE-SIN:S1B-013#53:1:A>
Now what's your ionic product

<ICE-SIN:S1B-013#54:1:A>
Okay your ionic product might be this multiplied by this okay

<ICE-SIN:S1B-013#55:1:A>
Right and all you have to do is see whether this value exceed or is
less than the Ksp for that particular salt uhm sulphide whether it's cadmium
manganese iron or nickel okay

<ICE-SIN:S1B-013#56:1:A>
Now in this case you probably should get uhm which one uh

<ICE-SIN:S1B-013#57:1:A>
Calcium sulphide and nickel sulphide being precipitated whereas
manganese and uh iron is not precipitated out as a sulphide okay

<ICE-SIN:S1B-013#58:1:A>
Right in question seven a you're dealing with silver chromate

<ICE-SIN:S1B-013#59:1:A>
Now silver chromate uhm what you want to do is you want to form a
saturated solution without any of the salt precipitating out okay

<ICE-SIN:S1B-013#60:1:A>
So what is the maximum concentration of AG plus that you can have
right

<ICE-SIN:S1B-013#61:1:A>
Now how do you calculate this This means that your ionic product
for silver chromate must be exactly equal to Ksp

<ICE-SIN:S1B-013#62:1:A>
Okay because when your ionic product is exactly equals to Ksp the
solution is saturated but there is no precipitate being formed alright

<ICE-SIN:S1B-013#63:1:A>
So what happens to that uhm if you write out the equilibrium you
know that for every one mole of silver chromate that dissociates two moles of
H plus and one mole of chromate ion are formed alright

<ICE-SIN:S1B-013#64:1:A>
So if your solubility of sil uh silver chromate is s alright the
amount of uh AG plus formed will be two s and the amount of chromate formed
will be s moles per dm cube

<ICE-SIN:S1B-013#65:1:A>
So you equate the two concentrations to your Ksp you calculate for
s you should get six point three times ten to the power minus five

<ICE-SIN:S1B-013#66:1:A>
Yes

<ICE-SIN:S1B-013#67:1:A>
Pardon

<ICE-SIN:S1B-013#68:1:A>
Thank you

<ICE-SIN:S1B-013#69:1:A>
Alright now you go on to the next part it's not just enough to
calculate solubility what you want is silver ion concentration alright which
is twice the solubility of silver chromate

<ICE-SIN:S1B-013#70:1:A>
Oh yes another thing uh most of you always forget to put the unit
so I deduct half a mark each time you do that alright

<ICE-SIN:S1B-013#71:1:A>
So your silver plus concentration is that you want to express that
in terms of grams per dm cube you multiply by the correct atomic mass okay

<ICE-SIN:S1B-013#72:1:A>
You should get zero point zero one three six gram per dm cube Again
watch your unit

<ICE-SIN:S1B-013#73:1:A>
Now for seven b there was some confusion alright

<ICE-SIN:S1B-013#74:1:A>
What you want to do is in this system that contains silver plus ion
and chromate ion you want to dissolve HCL alright but you want to dissolve
the HCL in such a way that you have a saturated solution but no precipitate
will form

<ICE-SIN:S1B-013#75:1:A>
Now what is this precipitate that will form

<ICE-SIN:S1B-013#76:1:A>
The precipitate will be silver chloride

<ICE-SIN:S1B-013#77:1:A>
Okay because HCL will dissociate in solution to give you the ions
alright

<ICE-SIN:S1B-013#78:1:A>
So what you have again like I always say it's soup of ion

<ICE-SIN:S1B-013#79:1:A>
Okay these two will not precipitate out just saturated

<ICE-SIN:S1B-013#80:1:A>
Now what you want to know is how much of this hydrochloric acid can
I add such that these two can be present in solution and will not come up as
a solid precipitate okay

<ICE-SIN:S1B-013#81:1:A>
Right

<ICE-SIN:S1B-013#82:1:A>
So most of you misunderstood the question you thought that oh it's
a completely new system I'm using a new solution that contains just silver
chloride

<ICE-SIN:S1B-013#83:1:A>
No

<ICE-SIN:S1B-013#84:1:A>
Alright you're using the same solution as in part seven a with a
new twist now your bubbly HCL into it alright

<ICE-SIN:S1B-013#85:1:A>
Okay so how do you calculate this part the maximum amount of HCL
that can be added

<ICE-SIN:S1B-013#86:1:A>
First you need to calculate the maximum chloride concentration that
can be dissolved alright and the only way you can do this is to equate this
with Ksp for a saturated solution of silver chloride

<ICE-SIN:S1B-013#87:1:A>
Now where did you get this silver plus from Right silver plus from

<ICE-SIN:S1B-013#88:1:A>
Your original solution containing silver and chromate and ion right

<ICE-SIN:S1B-013#89:1:A>
Therefore your silver plus concentration is actually your answer to
seven a okay

<ICE-SIN:S1B-013#90:1:A>
Right

<ICE-SIN:S1B-013#91:1:A>
Most of you equate oh silver plus equals chloride so you just put s
and s so it's s square equals to Ksp and you square it your whole expression
you get your chloride concentration

<ICE-SIN:S1B-013#92:1:A>
No

<ICE-SIN:S1B-013#93:1:A>
Alright

<ICE-SIN:S1B-013#94:1:A>
That is actually misreading the question okay

<ICE-SIN:S1B-013#95:1:A>
So your silver plus concentration you get from part seven a and
from this you can calculate your chloride concentration which is a very small
value uh

<ICE-SIN:S1B-013#96:1:A>
Right seven point nine four times ten to the power of minus seven
mole over dm cube Can you all see this

<ICE-SIN:S1B-013#97:1:A>
You all are speaking the answer is it Okay now for the next part
alright uhm expressing your chloride in terms of concentration is not enough
because the question asks you for the mass you know mass of HCL that can be
dissolved in two hundred and fifty cm cube of the solution okay

<ICE-SIN:S1B-013#98:1:A>
So what you have to do is actually calculate the number of moles
HCL that can be dissolved in two hundred and fifty cm cube alright

<ICE-SIN:S1B-013#99:1:A>
Now you know that your chloride concentration is equivalent to your
hydrochloric acid concentration

<ICE-SIN:S1B-013#100:1:A>
This is because hydrochloric acid will completely dissociate into
ions okay

<ICE-SIN:S1B-013#101:1:A>
So therefore your HCL concentration will also be the same value
right

<ICE-SIN:S1B-013#102:1:A>
And from there you use proportion to calculate the maximum mass of
HCL in two hundred and fifty cm cube

<ICE-SIN:S1B-013#103:1:A>
Right you just divide the answer by four and multiply by the
molecular mass of HCL you get a very small value okay

<ICE-SIN:S1B-013#104:1:A>
Okay seven point two seven times ten to the power minus six square
alright

<ICE-SIN:S1B-013#105:1:A>
Any of you all have any questions

<ICE-SIN:S1B-013#106:1:A>
Yes

<ICE-SIN:S1B-013#107:1:A>
Yes

<ICE-SIN:S1B-013#108:1:A>
No what you're talking about is ah you're confusing number of
moles and concentration

<ICE-SIN:S1B-013#109:1:A>
Now whether I have two hundred and fifty cm cube or or one
thousand cm cube solution alright a saturated solution of silver chromate
will always have the same concentration of silver ion but the number of moles
present in two hundred and fifty cm cube and present in one thousand cm cube
will be different okay

<ICE-SIN:S1B-013#110:1:A>
Alright uhm now if you see in seven a okay what is the mass of AG
plus in one dm cube of a saturate solution of silver chromate

<ICE-SIN:S1B-013#111:1:A>
Alright now that means your answer will be gram for every one dm
cube correct

<ICE-SIN:S1B-013#112:1:A>
Isn't that another way of expressing concentration gram per dm
cube okay

<ICE-SIN:S1B-013#113:1:A>
Or rather you can say concentration is actually how many moles of
silver plus in one dm cube

<ICE-SIN:S1B-013#114:1:A>
Isn't that mole per dm cube

<ICE-SIN:S1B-013#115:1:A>
That's also AG plus concentration alright

<ICE-SIN:S1B-013#116:1:A>
So it's the number of moles in one dm cube

<ICE-SIN:S1B-013#117:1:A>
Yes yes

<ICE-SIN:S1B-013#118:1:A>
Ya oh no no no no if you read seven b ah what is the maximum mass
of hydrogen chloride that can dissolve in two hundred and fifty cm cube of a
saturated solution of silver chromate saturated solution of silver chromate
and uh for seven b and seven a also saturated solution of silver chromate

<ICE-SIN:S1B-013#119:1:A>
So in both cases seven a and seven b one is one dm cube the other
one is two hundred and fifty cm cube However both are saturated solution and
therefore no matter what the volume you have for solution your concentration
of silver plus is still is still the same because both solutions are the same
it's just that you have different volumes of them <X>

<ICE-SIN:S1B-013#X120:1:A>
However your number of moles of silver plus will be different
There'll be more in the one thousand cm cube than in two hundred and fifty cm
Concentration is different What No there is no dilution You don't transfer or
what you just use the same solution and you just bubble in HCL that's all
okay Alright Any other questions None </X> </I>
