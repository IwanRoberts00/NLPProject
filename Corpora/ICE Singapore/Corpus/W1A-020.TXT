Q1 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-020#2:1>
Clausewitz has been
considered by many as a master strategist and foremost writer on war because
of his wide understanding of the overall perspective of war.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-020#3:1>
He had been known as the philosopher of war.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-020#4:1>
Not only did he view war in terms of operational
tactics on the battleground, Clausewitz also encompassed the relevance of
national policy and the state in his writings. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-020#5:1>
Therefore, he was able to link the relevance of politics and war together.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-020#6:1>
Indeed, Clausewitz could be considered the master
strategist because some of his insights can be applied to modern war context.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-020#7:1>
To assess if Clausewitz's reputation is justified, I
will look at the major contributions of Clausewitz, the relevance of his
theories in today's context, and also compare him with other military
strategic thinkers. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-020#8:1>
The most striking feature of
Clausewitz's contribution, I feel, is his emphasis on total or absolute war.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-020#9:1>
In this, he mentioned that war can be viewed in 2
different ways. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-020#10:1>
The nature of war could be seen in
terms of a total absolute war or a limited war. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-020#11:1>
A
total war would require devotion of massive resources by the state.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-020#12:1>
This would require the commitment of mass population,
industrial strength and resources. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-020#13:1>
He advocated the
use of total war because this would give a decisive impact on the procedures
of war-making. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-020#14:1>
A limited war would, on the other hand,
require the commitment of resources sufficient just to achieve the main
military-political objective. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-020#15:1>
As such, this would not
exhaust the total economy of the state. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-020#16:1>
In viewing
Clausewitz's idea, the use of absolute total war could be linked to the
politics-war relationship. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-020#17:1>
This means that Clausewitz
realized the importance of having full state control in deciding on a war.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-020#18:1>
The military, as expounded by Clausewitz, is
subordinated to the civilian state command. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-020#19:1>
Because
the military objective is part of the entire national objective, the military
will have to be subjected to state control. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-020#20:1>
As
Clausewitz understood, war is merely an extension of the state.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-020#21:1>
Therefore, respect should be given to Clausewitz for
catalysing this understanding. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-020#22:1>
Although Niccolo
Machiavelli also propounded that war and state are inseparable, one must give
due recognition to Clausewitz for having related the close connection between
state national objective and military objective. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-020#23:1>
Another of Clausewitz's contributions would be his understanding of a certain
degree of friction when conducting a total war. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-020#24:1>
He
mentioned that war is usually faced with a few inevitable frictional forces.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-020#25:1>
For instance, the physical exhaustion of the army
forces would be a big hindrance to smooth war actions. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-020#26:1>
Besides, there is the uncertainty and chance that one has to face in war-
making. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-020#27:1>
This is kept very much to an unexpected turn
of events because no one can ensure a smooth implementation of war actions.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-020#28:1>
In war, there is also a certain degree of the fear of
danger in troops. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-020#29:1>
This is a human factor not to be
discounted with. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-020#30:1>
Also, the morale of the troops is a
significant factor which can either make or break a successful war.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-020#31:1>
In pointing these factors of friction, Clausewitz had
been effective in revealing the uncertainty of war. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-020#32:1>
He
was indeed a foremost writer on the actual apprehension of war.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-020#33:1>
In a way, he prepared the future generations in
expecting the worst that could emanate from a war. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-020#34:1>
The
next important idea of Clausewitz was the centre of gravity.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-020#35:1>
In this, Clausewitz mentioned that the most decisive
and devastating act of a military force should be directed at the core of the
enemy. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-020#36:1>
This nerve centre was considered by Clausewitz
as the centre of gravity. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-020#37:1>
To him, this core was the
most important of the enemy's survival. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-020#38:1>
It could
constitute any form, for instance, the enemy' industrial center, the enemy's
military forces, or the enemy's communication lines. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-020#39:1>
As such, the centre of gravity would differ from state to state.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-020#40:1>
But, ultimately, this was the most vital enemy point
for attack. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-020#41:1>
If a successful blow was rendered on this
core, the enemy would sustain much casualties, and hence would crumble in a
short period of time. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-020#42:1>
This theory, I feel, is one of
Clausewitz's strongest contributions. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-020#43:1>
He was right in
identifying such an important point for attack. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-020#44:1>
This
factor can be seen as relevant and practical in modern context.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-020#45:1>
For instance, the Gulf War, 1991 had demonstrated that
the U.S.-led allied forces had been attacking Iraq's nerve centre - the oil
plants, the installation and ammunition centres. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-020#46:1>
The
main strategy of the Allied forces was to attack Iraq's vital survival
points. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-020#47:1>
True enough, the devastation created by such
an attack was decisive and overpowering, bringing Iraq to the negotiation
table. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-020#48:1>
Hence, Clausewitz's contribution of this 'centre
of gravity' idea can still be practised today. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-020#49:1>
Another
of his ideas relevant today is the relationship between war and politics.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-020#50:1>
Instead of resolving to war straightaway, the United
States decided to use diplomacy first. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-020#51:1>
As such,
various rounds of diplomatic negotiations were held between Iraq and the
major Western powers like the United States, and even the United Nations as a
representative body of the international realm. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-020#52:1>
As
such, one can say that Clausewitz's ideas had been practical for his days,
and even relevant for today. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-020#53:1>
Indeed, he was a profound
master strategist that propounded very realistic and practical theories.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-020#54:1>
However, one misgiving about Clausewitz's theory is
the use of absolute war. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-020#55:1>
In today's world, not all
countries practise this theory. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-020#56:1>
Instead of using the
military force as the backbone of supremacy and power, countries like Japan
and Germany are using the economic tool to attain world status.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-020#57:1>
Therefore, Clausewitz's idea of having a total war to
gain superiority would be considered obsolete today. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-020#58:1>
Regardless of this impractical theory found in the use of absolute war today,
Clausewitz's contributions are still considered impressive and significant.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-020#59:1>
The fact that the idea of the centre of gravity exists
till today, shows that Clausewitz was able to view war-making in an overall
perspective. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-020#60:1>
His ideas showed his capacity in linking
the military/war effort with the wider scope of national state objective.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-020#61:1>
In this way, Clausewitz's perception was not confined
to mainly a limited war zone or the tactical operations on the battleground.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-020#62:1>
Hence, I would consider Clausewitz's reputation as
based on firm foundation, and not that of being blown out of proportion.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-020#63:1>
In comparing with Jomini's narrow perspective,
Clausewitz appeared more efficient in encompassing the state into the arena
of war-making decision. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-020#64:1>
Jomini mainly elaborated and
emphasised on the lines of operation in the actual theatre of war.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-020#65:1>
His idea was concentrated on just the battlefield.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-020#66:1>
The zones of operations were seen as the most vital
maneuvering platform. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-020#67:1>
In a way, Jomini had viewed war
in a limited and narrow scope. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-020#68:1>
Clausewitz, however,
transcended Jomini's perspective to include a wider scenario.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-020#69:1>
In comparing with Sun Tzu, the age-old Chinese
strategic thinker, Clausewitz was similar in raising the issue of war being
closely connected with politics. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-020#70:1>
Indeed, there was a
profound importance in this because both of them had shown that war is not
only a military concern, but also a political commitment.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-020#71:1>
This political/military perspective was to later
influence Mao Tsetung's revolutionary course in China. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-020#72:1>
Hence, Clausewitz's idea of politics and war could be said to have a
revolutionary character. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-020#73:1>
As such, his contributions
could be considered as a vital and significant one for the study of military
history and strategic thought. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-020#74:1>
In conclusion, I feel
that Clausewitz deserves to be called a master strategist and foremost writer
on war. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-020#75:1>
He made unique contribution which were an
eye-opener to most military historians. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-020#76:1>
Indeed, his
reputation as a philosopher of war and a strategist is seen to be qualified.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-020#77:1>
The relevance of his theories also enhanced his
reputation since it is based on firm conclusion that his theories are still
being practised today by many military strategists. </I>

<ICE-SIN:W1A-020#78:2>
Q2 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-020#79:2>
Sun Tzu's writings are
most impressive in " The Art of War" which was written during the 4th century
B.C. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-020#80:2>
His theories have been practised by contemporary
revolutionaries like Mao Tse-tung. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-020#81:2>
Hence, Sun Tzu's
writings are considered to be relevant even in today's context.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-020#82:2>
His understanding of the requirements of making a
non-violent war must be said to be the most impressive and significant.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-020#83:2>
As such, the merits of Sun Tzu's writings must be
elaborated. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-020#84:2>
First, although Sun Tzu's " The Art of
War" was written long time ago, he displayed profound understanding of the
close relationship between war and politics. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-020#85:2>
For
instance, Sun Tzu advocated that the art of war is actually to have no war.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-020#86:2>
If there is to be war ultimately, it should be
conducted with little or no violence. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-020#87:2>
Therefore, this
preference for minimum violence can be said to have a lasting impact even up
till today. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-020#88:2>
In Mao Tse-tung's fight against the
Nationalists in China, he employed the strategy of relating political
struggle with military operations. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-020#89:2>
Therefore, his
revolutionary war succeeded in gaining widespread popular support from the
peasants with little or no violence at all. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-020#90:2>
It was
truly a practise of Sun Tzu's theory of conducting a war with not much
violence. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-020#91:2>
Another illustration of contemporary
practise of Sun Tzu's teachings is the diplomatic and economic measures
adopted by the Western powers against Iraq when it invaded Kuwait on August
2, 1990. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-020#92:2>
Instead of resorting to immediate war action
to drive out the Iraqis, the Western Allied Powers decided to employ
non-violent means to oust the Iraqis. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-020#93:2>
Thus, economic
blockades, economic sanctions and diplomatic negotiations were practised
first. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-020#94:2>
This again paralleled Sun Tzu's idea of having
a war conducted with no war. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-020#95:2>
The relevance of Sun
Tzu's writings is therefore, certainly a great boost to Sun Tzu's reputation
as having " eternal freshness". 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-020#96:2>
Another of Sun Tzu's
theories explains the element of flexibility. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-020#97:2>
Sun
Tzu's understands that war is full of uncertainties. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-020#98:2>
Therefore, the military operations and strategy adopted by any commander
should be flexible and adaptable to the changing conditions.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-020#99:2>
To elaborate further, Sun Tzu says that war is like
water. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-020#100:2>
It takes no fixed form, and therefore, has no
constant feature. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-020#101:2>
This is indeed a practical
approach, especially if we scrutinize Mao Tse-tung's revolutionary war.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-020#102:2>
Instead of adopting a fixed stand, or a fixed
strategy, Mao was flexible with his tactical operations against Chiang
Kai-shek's Nationalist Army. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-020#103:2>
When losses seemed
imminent, Mao would withdraw. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-020#104:2>
This enabled him to
recuperate at his base areas and to rebuild his army's strength again.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-020#105:2>
Hence, Sun Tzu's theory of flexibility and
adaptability had inspired Mao to propound this exercise: <X>

<ICE-SIN:W1A-020#X106:2>
<quote> " When the enemy advances, we retreat When
the enemy camps, we harass When the enemy tires, we advance When the enemy
retreat, we pursue." </quote> </X> 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-020#107:2>
This definitely,
had been influenced by Sun Tzu's ideas. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-020#108:2>
Being
adaptable and flexible is still a relevant practise in today's war.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-020#109:2>
Sun Tzu also explained the importance of using
intelligence, deception and secret agents. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-020#110:2>
To qualify
this, he mentioned that to win a war with minimal or no violence, one should
understand the enemy's strengths and weaknesses. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-020#111:2>
To
do this, one must employ intelligence and secret agents.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-020#112:2>
This had been relevant in Mao's revolutionary course
in China, when he utilised the peasant masses as part-time soldiers in the
Red Guards. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-020#113:2>
These armed citizens would report to Mao
and the Red Army ( full-time communist revolutionary fighters) about the
tactics and operations of the Nationalist Army. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-020#114:2>
Sometimes, these Red Guards would also make minor ambushes and small-scale
battles on the Nationalists. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-020#115:2>
Hence, Mao enjoyed the
supply of information and knowledge by these easily accessible intelligence
sources. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-020#116:2>
In a way, Mao's operations and strategy were
greatly influenced by Sun Tzu who believed that " All warfare is based on
deception". 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-020#117:2>
He also would use decoy plans to " offer
the enemy a bait to lure him". 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-020#118:2>
In Mao's writings, he
showed similar attitude when he said that " War demands deception".

<ICE-SIN:W1A-020#119:2>
Therefore, Sun Tzu's writings showed a depth of
understanding for the actual conduct of war, but deception can be a useful
and effective tool to attain success. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-020#120:2>
Indeed, Sun
Tzu's writings had shown great profundity and relevance in today's war. <X>

<ICE-SIN:W1A-020#X121:2>
Sun Tzu also advocated the emphasis on human factor.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-020#X122:2>
He realized that the government should be a
people-oriented one; committed to the welfare of the masses.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-020#X123:2>
This was clearly adopted by Mao who understood that
to gain the people's sympathy and support, the main tool or plan would be to
redistribute land to the people and reduce land rent.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-020#X124:2>
After gaining the people's support, Mao would then
be able to fight a " People's war" since China's population consisted of
mainly agrarian peasants. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-020#X125:2>
True enough, this strategy
worked for Mao, and he ultimately defeated the Nationalists in 1949.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-020#X126:2>
Sun Tzu's writings therefore, revealed deep
comprehensiveness and understanding. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-020#X127:2>
He seemed to be
able to weave socio-political means into the conduct of war.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-020#X128:2>
This capability of Sun Tzu therefore rendered him a
thinker with profound insight and clearer vision. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-020#X129:2>
Besides these theories, Sun Tzu also denounced prolonged or protracted war.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-020#X130:2>
He felt that to conduct a prolonged war would
indicate that the strategy was not properly executed.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-020#X131:2>
This would mean a failed mission.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-020#X132:2>
Also, a prolonged war would cause one's own
financial and resource base to be exhausted. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-020#X133:2>
This
would ultimately affect one's own supply of resource and material.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-020#X134:2>
It would also make better sense to adopt, imbibe a
still intact enemy territory than to take in a devastated one.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-020#X135:2>
Therefore, Sun Tzu's theory was clear in explaining
the relationship between the duration of a war and the economy of a state.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-020#X136:2>
This idea can be seen as relevant in today's context
because the American war in Vietnam demonstrated that a prolonged war would
kill American public interest and finally affect public opinion about the
war. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-020#X137:2>
Also, the financial drain suffered by the
Americans during and after the Vietnam War showed that Sun Tzu's theory is
still very much relevant today. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-020#X138:2>
" The Art of War" by
Sun Tzu, therefore, has very practical implications for today's context.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-020#X139:2>
Sun Tzu's writings demonstrated deep understanding
of the human mind, and clear comprehension of the relationship between
politics and war. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-020#X140:2>
Indeed, much of Sun Tzu's writings
are relevant today. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-020#X141:2>
His writings can be valued as
the most profound strategic thoughts, widely-read and practised today.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-020#X142:2>
Although written four thousand years ago, Sun Tzu's "
The Art of War" should not be dismissed as obsolete. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-020#X143:2>
On the contrary, it showed great understanding for the very essence of the
conduct of war. </X> </I>
