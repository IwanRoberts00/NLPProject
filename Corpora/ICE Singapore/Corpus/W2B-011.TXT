<ICE-SIN:W2B-011#1:1>
<h> Delilah </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-011#2:1>
Oooooh.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-011#3:1>
I love men!

<ICE-SIN:W2B-011#4:1>
Particularly Caucasians.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-011#5:1>
They're so strong, tall, and all that blonde hair ...particularly on
their broad chests.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-011#6:1>
Only Caucasians live up to the ideal of being tall, dark - that is,
tanned - and handsome.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-011#7:1>
And I don't go for the Singaporean male.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-011#8:1>
Singaporean men are absolutely feeble compared to Caucasians.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-011#9:1>
They've got no style, no charisma, no muscles or deep-set eyes.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-011#10:1>
I think Singaporean men are disgusting - don't you think so?

<ICE-SIN:W2B-011#11:1>
They just turn me on, the very instant I catch sight of them.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-011#12:1>
The Caucasians, that is.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-011#13:1>
They are so attractive

<ICE-SIN:W2B-011#14:1>
I practically felt I need them.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-011#15:1>
I would die without them.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-011#16:1>
Particularly the one I saw at Marina Centre this morning.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-011#17:1>
He had the cutest little bum.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-011#18:1>
Naturally I cat-walked past him and gave him my Kathleen Turner look,
eyes half-closed, lips smooching.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-011#19:1>
He didn't take the bait.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-011#20:1>
A bitchy red-head came up and steered him off by the arm.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-011#21:1>
She called him " Michael, dear" and gave me a funny look.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-011#22:1>
I suppose she was his girlfriend, so I threw her my bitchy Jaclyn
Smith smile.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-011#23:1>
I hope she realises I've got assets that can beat hers anytime.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-011#24:1>
It was, however, a pity about that cute bum.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-011#25:1>
No worries, in any case.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-011#26:1>
Men are never too scarce for me, Delilah.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-011#27:1>
Yes, I chose the name because it is so me.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-011#28:1>
I go wandering around picking up gorgeous Samsons like influenza
viruses from the air.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-011#29:1>
Only too easy.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-011#30:1>
My favourite pick-up point is at B------- Lounge.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-011#31:1>
It's this place at S------ Shopping Centre that has such ambience.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-011#32:1>
The cool, casual jazz will play and people just hang about looking -
in the way one inspects goods, I suppose.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-011#33:1>
I order my drink like anybody else - my usual is the impeccable
Virgin Chi Chi - and slowly sip it, eyes taking in the night's crop, scouting
for a good catch.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-011#34:1>
The whole room will be full of hungry, licentious bachelors, all with
eyes drifting like my own.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-011#35:1>
Then accidentally, your eyes meets with this good-looking stranger's.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-011#36:1>
You smile; he smiles.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-011#37:1>
The rest follows.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-011#38:1>
It is ever so easy to find someone when you're lonely.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-011#39:1>
The snitch is that sometimes you're unlucky and your eyes meet with
the wrong person's: meaning some obese monster with a belly circumference of
at least fifty inches.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-011#40:1>
Then he starts leering at you and you feel your goose pimples
prickling frightfully.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-011#41:1>
And you involuntarily shiver.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-011#42:1>
Then you start playing hide-and-seek with him in the lounge, escaping
to the ladies so that he can't trail you, or flitting to any corner he walks
away from, and when he starts walking towards you again, you scramble over
again to the other side.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-011#43:1>
Thankfully, the more intelligent ones get the hint and go back to
looking depressed.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-011#44:1>
If some idiot just proves to be persistent, I ordinarily put on my
vixen-act.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-011#45:1>
I splash my Virgin Chi Chi at him and smack him in the face.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-011#46:1>
I scream, " Oh, how dare you!"

<ICE-SIN:W2B-011#47:1>
They are usually too bewildered to do anything about it afterwards,
and I walk off scot-free.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-011#48:1>
This also usually means the lounge manager will frown upon me as a
trouble-maker.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-011#49:1>
They don't appreciate anyone who makes a scene at their place,
whatever the reason.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-011#50:1>
I switch to streetwise tours, in that case.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-011#51:1>
These are located around R------- Road and thereabouts.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-011#52:1>
I put on my Shiseido make-up, my big-bust Dolly Parton dress with
hardly any front and French fancy stockings and, bombs away, off I go to
conquer my lusty males.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-011#53:1>
In the words of Nelson: I come, I see, I conquer!

<ICE-SIN:W2B-011#54:1>
Or rather, I see, I conquer, then come - if you know what I mean.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-011#55:1>
I usually have to take bus number 1- there, unless the day before
some guy gives a big tip and I can afford my occasional taxi.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-011#56:1>
You look more high-class stepping out of a taxi, you see.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-011#57:1>
Next you glance around and estimate your competition, which believe
me, will make you laugh.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-011#58:1>
Some of them are so obviously manly.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-011#59:1>
Yet they try to pretend they are Michelle Pfeiffer or Bo Derek:
perfectly shameless!

<ICE-SIN:W2B-011#60:1>
I will throw them a Tanya Roberts look of bitchiness and make my way
through to the inner alleys where it is slightly darker.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-011#61:1>
I assure you, that's where you find the best customers - and the most
exciting activities.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-011#62:1>
Then: you just stand there and wait.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-011#63:1>
And watch.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-011#64:1>
Sometimes there are a few very-green boys who come in and take a few
scared peeks and then walk out again.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-011#65:1>
They make me giggle, and I usually raise my eyebrow suggestively at
them and watch them blush.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-011#66:1>
If they're cute, they get my sexy smile too.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-011#67:1>
I won't mind doing it with them for free.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-011#68:1>
If they're ugly, well, too bad, sonny: you're just not my kind.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-011#69:1>
I will divert my eyes and imagine they're invisible.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-011#70:1>
Unless I feel very bitchy that night and feel like leading them on.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-011#71:1>
Then I usually make all sorts of randy moves at them until they get
hooked: I stroll into the darkness and make them follow; then ooops, I
disappear from sight and they find themselves alone in the alley.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-011#72:1>
Ha ha!

<ICE-SIN:W2B-011#73:1>
Serves than right for thinking they're Casanova material!

<ICE-SIN:W2B-011#74:1>
But the usual bunch along R-------- Road consists mostly of American
and European sailors.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-011#75:1>
They always come in a group and oh, they're soooooo gorgeous!

<ICE-SIN:W2B-011#76:1>
They're always young, they're always cheerful, they never wear
spectacles.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-011#77:1>
They take it all so casually and do it so skillfully.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-011#78:1>
Local guys have nothing to compare.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-011#79:1>
Like there was that one time this Yugoslavian beefcake came up to me
with his smaller friend and started gesturing three fingers at me.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-011#80:1>
I didn't understand at first, but got it later.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-011#81:1>
We were a marvellous threesome.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-011#82:1>
I guarantee you, they know the most fascinating tricks and are so
much fun.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-011#83:1>
And that is apart from the fact that they pay well!

<ICE-SIN:W2B-011#84:1>
Therefore everybody in the alley always gets excited when these
sailors arrive.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-011#85:1>
Some start to make irritating sounds like they've got excessive
saliva dripping from their big mouths.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-011#86:1>
Some begin to groan as if they've been happily knocked down by an oil
tanker.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-011#87:1>
Others act like they are cats, or their ulcers are so painful they
cannot keep their tongues from sticking out.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-011#88:1>
I choose to be more spectacular.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-011#89:1>
I give them my irresistible Janet Jackson walk right past my
earmarked sailor and fling my hair piquantly back.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-011#90:1>
I never fail to get my man: which shows you how effective my
technique is.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-011#91:1>
In fact, they are often the best catch of the lot.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-011#92:1>
And soooooo satisfying, I don't want them to pay after the whole
thing.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-011#93:1>
They have already given me satisfaction.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-011#94:1>
My most fulfilling beau, however, is this teacher I picked up
sometime in March last year.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-011#95:1>
Now this was at the Botanical Gardens, about ten plus at night.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-011#96:1>
I was sitting seductively on the grass, pretending to mind my own
business, when suddenly out of the bushes a dark shadow emerged.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-011#97:1>
At first I thought it was some over-active couple accidentally
tumbling out.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-011#98:1>
They might have been carried away with what they were doing or
something.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-011#99:1>
Then I noticed it was just one person, who stood quite still there
for a while.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-011#100:1>
It was dark; I couldn't see his face very well.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-011#101:1>
But it was obvious he was tall and not badly built.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-011#102:1>
He whispered to me.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-011#103:1>
I could hear he had a foreign accent.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-011#104:1>
That did it.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-011#105:1>
I whispered back to him and immediately went with him to his place,
which was somewhere near M------- S--------- Walk.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-011#106:1>
We had a heavenly time.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-011#107:1>
This fantastic beau of mine, whom I later nicknamed 'Dick', had
darling blue eyes and soft golden blonde hair and was once an American
football player.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-011#108:1>
He was so strong we did it three times that night and next morning
he was ready for more.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-011#109:1>
I never had anyone equal to him in performance.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-011#110:1>
He was absolutely perfect; and no one will ever beat him.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-011#111:1>
Naturally I didn't collect his money.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-011#112:1>
Instead, I took the next day off and stayed in bed.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-011#113:1>
With Dick, that is.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-011#114:1>
I practically fainted when he suggested we live together for a
while.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-011#115:1>
He said he liked me very much; and I gave him my Brigitte Bardot
kiss.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-011#116:1>
Voulez-vous?

<ICE-SIN:W2B-011#117:1>
Things continued incredibly smoothly.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-011#118:1>
We actually managed to stick together for three months.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-011#119:1>
Imagine that!

<ICE-SIN:W2B-011#120:1>
That was the longest I had ever remained attached to any single man.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-011#121:1>
But reality per normal stepped in and snatched my adorable Dick away
into another's arms.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-011#122:1>
The loves and passions of my kind are merely fetishes which bring
pleasure for the present, you see.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-011#123:1>
They never last long.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-011#124:1>
It is a pity, isn't it?

<ICE-SIN:W2B-011#125:1>
Dick seemed quite the ideal partner!

<ICE-SIN:W2B-011#126:1>
But they are like cabbages.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-011#127:1>
If you keep them in the fridge too long, they grow stale and turn
rotten.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-011#128:1>
Knowing this only too well, I had let my Dick go, and I went back to
my spinsterhood again.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-011#129:1>
I still keep his photographs in my memo book, in which he signed " I
shall always love you" before he left.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-011#130:1>
When I get nostalgic, I would occasionally take it out to fondle and
masturbate with - ooops, but don't let me get bitchy ...

<ICE-SIN:W2B-011#131:1>
So things returned to normal for me.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-011#132:1>
I get over things like Dick pretty comfortably, and new things, new
hopes, new men come into my life.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-011#133:1>
I am doing extremely well.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-011#134:1>
That is, compared to others still standing around that alley in
R------- Road.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-011#135:1>
What with AIDS and give-birth-to-more-children campaigns spreading
like fire through Singapore, people like me get less opportunities with every
passing moment.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-011#136:1>
People think it is strange not having babies, let alone fall for
girls like me.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-011#137:1>
So less men become interested.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-011#138:1>
Furthermore, I am getting old.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-011#139:1>
A friend of mine recently told me l had appeared as if I was getting
quite desperate.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-011#140:1>
At the time I suppose I was.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-011#141:1>
Goods were scarce that evening, you see, and the most you could try
for were one-night stands, which were really much less satisfying.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-011#142:1>
Perhaps, I had hoped, I could settle on a permanent basis with
someone.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-011#143:1>
But alas, I am getting wrinkles on my face.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-011#144:1>
It is getting more difficult because everybody goes for younger,
fresher meat.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-011#145:1>
I am beginning to look haggard.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-011#146:1>
Even my friend agreed.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-011#147:1>
It is no longer me choosing them, but them choosing me.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-011#148:1>
It is why I've been going to more aerobics lessons lately.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-011#149:1>
I want to keep a trim waist and a supple anatomy.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-011#150:1>
I am also beginning to plant aloe veras on my veranda because the
sap in the leaves is supposed to be capable of healing wounds, cleaning hair,
and most important, keep my complexion succulent and tender.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-011#151:1>
It is because I do not want to spend the rest of my life alone.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-011#152:1>
I do not want to die uncared for: I need a lover-boy.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-011#153:1>
So I continue to ramble around and distribute my inviting Marilyn
Monroe looks.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-011#154:1>
They are going well, and so have my recent cosmetics sales - I sell
cosmetics, you see.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-011#155:1>
I target to find a permanent hubby in the next five years and also
to earn at least five thousand dollars a month and be really rich when I
retire.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-011#156:1>
I don't want to feel lonely when I grow old.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-011#157:1>
But then - who would?

<ICE-SIN:W2B-011#158:1>
Juliet

<ICE-SIN:W2B-011#159:1>
She never thought it would lead to this.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-011#160:1>
In her schooldays, she used to play truant and watch those tapes.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-011#161:1>
Father's tapes.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-011#162:1>
He kept them in a locked box underneath his bed and thought nobody
else in the family knew.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-011#163:1>
But Juliet knew.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-011#164:1>
She knew how he hid the key in the jar on a high ledge.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-011#165:1>
She knew how he would take the tapes out and watch them silently at
midnight, when everybody else was asleep.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-011#166:1>
She had a wary eye.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-011#167:1>
Consequently, without him knowing, Juliet, as a young boy, took
those tapes out to watch. <X>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-011#X168:1>
She would take the tapes out of the metal box, lock the house door,
sit in front of the TV-cum-video-machine and watch.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-011#X169:1>
It was the strangest programme. </X> </I>
