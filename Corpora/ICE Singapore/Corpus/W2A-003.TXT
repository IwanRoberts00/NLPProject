<h> INTRODUCTION </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-003#6:1>
The level of communications likely to be adopted by different
operating units within the construction procurement system can be looked at
through the linkages that exist between different operating units for any one
project.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-003#7:1>
These linkages, which also determine the relationship between units,
appear to be dependent on the contractual arrangements adopted.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-003#8:1>
The evolution of different contractual arrangements have been
noticeable in recent years in the construction industry.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-003#9:1>
Numerous works pertaining to alternative modes of procurement have
been published, drawing attention to the wide range of possible tendering
procedures and contractual arrangements which can be adopted in the industry.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-003#10:1>
The traditional mode of procurement was believed to be appropriate
only for the relatively simple construction of the past.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-003#11:1>
With the advent of new technologies, new requirements, increasingly
sophisticated organisational structures and growing magnitude and size of
projects, the traditional mode is now considered lacking to cope with the
multiplicity of problems inherent of such a scenario.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-003#12:1>
This has given rise to other alternative arrangements.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-003#13:1>
From both the contractual and technical point of view, conventional
risks in construction are implicitly linked to the criteria of time, cost and
quality when agreed and specified requirements are not fulfilled.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-003#14:1>
These, in effect, sum up succinctly the background for articulating
who and what is at risk.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-003#15:1>
Because this paradigm has been dealt with frequently and extolled by
others elsewhere, it is not the intention here to partake in this debate
further from this familiar perspective.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-003#16:1>
This paper essentially seeks to examine the communication risks
between different types of contractual arrangements in construction and, in
the process, hypothesize the various scenarios which may occur.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-003#17:1>
Communication risks in the context of this paper refer to the
probability of a breakdown in communication between parties to a contractual
arrangement.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-003#18:1>
It would appear that the more communication channels which a party to
a contractual arrangement is subject to, then correspondingly, the associated
communication risks will also become higher.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-003#19:1>
<h> CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-003#20:1>
It is, however, not the objective of this paper to discuss in details
the different types of contractual arrangements adopted by the construction
industry suffice to say that these have seemed to develop as a result of
increasing clients' demands.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-003#21:1>
Friedman ( 1984), for example, appears to suggest that the evolution
of different contract strategies are fundamentally modifications made in the
marketing direction to suit the clients' requirements.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-003#22:1>
In contrast, from a more conventional perspective, Smith ( 1984) has
expounded on the time, cost and performance requirements of the client where
considerable emphasis was placed on the quality, flexibility, adaptability
and functional aspects of the structure under consideration.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-003#23:1>
The development of alternative contract strategies, which seems to
have led to a consequential erosion of the traditional mode of procurement,
revolves around a desire to both integrate thedesign and construction
processes and to shorten the duration required for actual construction.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-003#24:1>
Because of the division between design and construction, critics have
dismissed the traditional mode for its lack of efficiency.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-003#25:1>
Contractors, it has frequently been argued, should have a more active
role to play during the design phase of a project.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-003#26:1>
Inputs of construction expertise to the designers' proposals at this
stage would serve to avoid or reduce any unorthodox practices which do not
match the clients' objectives in achieving value for money.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-003#27:1>
The separation of design from construction would mean that the
designers are not avail of the opportunity to benefit from the contractors'
expertise.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-003#28:1>
Without such a knowledge, it would be more difficult to synchronise
appropriate design schemes with the contractors' abilities and available
resources.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-003#29:1>
Contemporary contractual arrangements therefore seek to bridge the
gap between design and construction.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-003#30:1>
Contractual arrangements which are commonly adopted in the
construction industry are depicted in Figures 1 to 5.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-003#31:1>
The construction system is now disaggregated into five different
modes of procurement, each of which will be considered shortly.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-003#32:1>
These are:

<ICE-SIN:W2A-003#33:1>
1) The traditional contract arrangement.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-003#34:1>
2) Design and build contract.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-003#35:1>
3) Construction management approach.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-003#36:1>
4) Project management approach, and

<ICE-SIN:W2A-003#37:1>
5) Management contracting.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-003#38:1>
To achieve hypothetical simplicity for examining communication risks,
other procurement methods suggested by Masterman ( 1988) such as the Design
and management contract, Package deal, Turnkey contract and the British
Property Federation ( BPF) system will not be considered in this paper.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-003#39:1>
An attempt will be made in each of these five strategic types to show
the conceptual relationships between the different operating units in
communication terms.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-003#40:1>
Operating units are used here to denote the individuals or
organizations who participate in any one contractual arrangement.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-003#41:1>
For clarity, the operating units in Figures 1 to 5 is hierarchically
structured to show the flow of communication.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-003#42:1>
The number of operating units is only indicative of what may actually
be encountered in real life.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-003#43:1>
Hence, while the label " consultant" includes the various independent
professions within the construction industry, other operating units such as
nominated and domestic suppliers will be annotated under the heading of "
supplier".

<ICE-SIN:W2A-003#44:1>
Likewise, nominated, domestic and labouronly subcontractors as well
as plant hiring firms were generally included under the heading of "
subcontractor".

<ICE-SIN:W2A-003#45:1>
Regulatory and other government agencies acting on behalf of the
authorities are not included in this hypothetical treatise.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-003#46:1>
Several other assumptions are also made in this hypothetical approach
to conceptualising communication flows for the construction industry.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-003#47:1>
Firstly, for the reason of clarity mentioned above, each operating
unit is considered within the context of only one individual contract.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-003#48:1>
This may not always be the case in practice as parties frequently
find themselves operating spontaneously in several projects all at the same
time.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-003#49:1>
Secondly, the client is explored in this paper as a single entity
without any supporting specialisms from within.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-003#50:1>
Clients are therefore assumed to be less than knowledgeable and have
to rely on outside consultants for advice to safeguard their interests.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-003#51:1>
A growing number of well-informed clients, particularly the larger
ones and most public sector organizations, however, do have their own
in-house professional employees with comparable, if not better, expertise
than the external consultants.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-003#52:1>
Clients' in-house staff are therefore not considered here as well.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-003#53:1>
Lastly, by referring strictly only to operating units within each
contractual arrangement, organisations outside of the contract proper in each
hierarchical framework shown in Figures 1 to 5 are also excluded.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-003#54:1>
The client, especially one in the private sector, is assumed to have
the requisite financial resources to fund a project.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-003#55:1>
This may not always be the case in practice because there are always
instances where funds are engineered from some other sources such as banks
and in the case of construction in the less developed countries,
international lending agencies such as the Asian Development Bank and the
World Bank.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-003#56:1>
The client's position in each mode of procurement may not therefore
be absolute in that sense.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-003#57:1>
Some situations will always remain where the clients, consultants and
contractors alike need to market the feasibility and viability of their
respective undertakings to yet other organisations outside the institutional
frameworks considered in this paper.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-003#58:1>
<h> INTERPRETATIONS </h> The structural relationships of each of the
procurement modes shown in Figures 1 to 5 are quantified in Tables 1 to 5
respectively.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-003#59:1>
This crude quantification process is carried out simply by physically
counting the number of communication flows directed towards ( ie inflows) and
away ( ie outflows) from each operating unit.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-003#60:1>
The primary and secondary communication flows are indicated in
Figures 1 to 5 using normal arrowed lines and broken arrowed lines
respectively.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-003#61:1>
The orgnisational hierarchy between various operating units, as
determined by their economic and occupational orders, is also shown.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-003#62:1>
In the context of this paper, primary communication flows are defined
as first-order priority activities directed by one operating unit towards
another to achieve set marketing objectives.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-003#63:1>
Secondary communication flows, on the other hand, are defined as
second-order priority activities directed by one operating unit towards
another to achieve set marketing objectives.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-003#64:1>
First-order priority activities are marketing activities which are
more concentrated, rigorous and intense than second-order priority
activities.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-003#65:1>
The former is therefore aimed at prospective clients who have direct
and substantial influence over purchasing decisions.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-003#66:1>
As a result, it would not be unreasonable to expect the flow of
marketing efforts to be primarily from vendors to buyers, the intensity of
which is dependent on the authority a prospective buyer commands and exerts
in making purchasing decisions.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-003#67:1>
Marketing intensities therefore describe the spectrum of activities
that lies between the first-order and second-order priorities.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-003#68:1>
Nevertheless, it should be noted that a high degree of subjectivity
will inevitably be invoked if marketing intensities were to be determined and
measured.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-003#69:1>
<h> THE TRADITIONAL ARRANGEMENT </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-003#70:1>
The client, consultant, main contractor, subcontractor and supplier
are the operating units considered in this arrangement.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-003#71:1>
As noted above, the communication flows were directed expectedly from
sellers to buyers of products and services as shown in figure 1.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-003#72:1>
Because the supplier is predominately concerned with marketing his
products to the consultant, main contractor and subcontractor, there is an
intense flow of primary communication in this direction.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-003#73:1>
On the other hand, secondary marketing efforts are also directed from
the supplier to the client who nevertheless retains an influence over the
selection and purchase of the supplier's product offerings.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-003#74:1>
The more pertinent observations which can be derived from this
hypothetical scenario include the following: It may be unrealistic to assume
that marketing efforts flow only from sellers to buyers.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-003#75:1>
Circumstances could arise where the reverse may also be true.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-003#76:1>
This would appear to be the case for both the main contractor and
subcontractor where secondary marketing efforts are channelled towards the
supplier for the purpose of securing extended credit terms.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-003#77:1>
This would, however, be unnecessary if the supplier operates in a
competitive environment where attractive credit terms are adopted as a
marketing tool in a buyer's market.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-003#78:1>
Marketing efforts may, therefore, follow a two-way flow.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-003#79:1>
These can either be inflows directed towards an operating unit or
outflows directed away from an operating unit.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-003#80:1>
The higher an operating unit is within the contractual hierarchy, the
more marketing efforts are likely to be directed towards it.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-003#81:1>
The client, as the supreme paymaster, will inevitably receive more
primary and secondary inflows of marketing efforts than other operating
units.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-003#82:1>
Table 1 is an attempt to quantify the intensities of marketing flow
efforts for the traditional contract arrangement.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-003#83:1>
As can be seen in Table 1, a systemic balance has been maintained for
both the inflows and outflows of both primary and secondary marketing
efforts.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-003#84:1>
A total of 24 communication flows was generated.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-003#85:1>
Hypothetically, these represent the communication channels through
which products and services are marketed.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-003#86:1>
It would generally appear that the more channels there are, the
higher will be the risks of communication barriers or breakdowns and the
greater the influence these will have on the marketing of one's products and
services.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-003#87:1>
These general observations are also applicable for the other four
approaches to project procurement.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-003#88:1>
<h> DESIGN AND BUILD CONTRACT </h> The operating units involved in
this approach are the client, main contractor, consultant, subcontractor and
supplier as shown in Figure 2, which is similar in many aspects to Figure 1
except that the hierarchical roles of both the consultant and main contractor
have now been reversed to account for the integration of both design and
construction.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-003#89:1>
The number of communication flows generated remain at 24 ( see Table
2).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-003#90:1>
<h> CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT APPROACH </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-003#91:1>
The client, consultant, construction manager, main contractor,
subcontractor and supplier are the operating units involved in this approach
in Figure 3.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-003#92:1>
The marketing flows are now less refined than the two previous
arrangements.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-003#93:1>
This may be attributed to the additional role of the construction
manager who now coordinates construction and design activities.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-003#94:1>
A reciprocal flow of secondary marketing efforts between the
construction manager and the consultant is therefore inevitable.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-003#95:1>
The number of marketing flow activities has now increased to 36 ( see
Table 3), an increase of 50% over the preceding two contractual arrangements.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-003#96:1>
An increase in the number of operating units within any procurement
systems would therefore lead to a spontaneous increase in the overall level
of marketing activities and communication flows. <X>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-003#X97:1>
<h> PROJECT MANAGEMENT APPROACH </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-003#X98:1>
The project management approach comprises of the client, project
manager, consultant, main contractor, subcontractor and supplier.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-003#X99:1>
The number of operating units involved is similar to the
construction management approach and remains at 6 ( see Figure 4).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-003#X100:1>
Similarly, the number of marketing flow activities remains
unchanged at 36 ( see Table 4), again an increase of 50% over both the
traditional as well as design and build arrangements.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-003#X101:1>
The reciprocal flow of secondary marketing efforts now prevails
between the consultant and the main contractor.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-003#X102:1>
<h> MANAGEMENT CONTRACTING </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-003#X103:1>
This procurement mode involves the client, consultant, management
contractor, subcontractor and supplier ( see Figure 5).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-003#X104:1>
The management contractor, in contrast to the main contractor under
the traditional arrangement, now coordinates construction works with design
activities.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-003#X105:1>
In their respective roles, there is now a reciprocal flow of
secondary marketing efforts between the management contractor and the
consultant.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-003#X106:1>
As indicated in table 5, the number of communication flows is now
26.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-003#X107:1>
This represents an increase of about 8% over both the traditional
and design and build arrangements, but yields a reduction of nearly 40% over
both the construction management and project management approaches.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-003#X108:1>
Based on these hypothetical measurements, management contracting
which generates 26 marketing flow activities appears to strike a balance
between the two extremes which display a low scale of 24 and a high scale of
36 respectively. </X> </I>
