<I>

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-004#1:1:A>
For a goal kick then to uh Trengganu in this the twenty-six
minutes of this second-half

<ICE-SIN:S2A-004#2:1:A>
No scores

<ICE-SIN:S2A-004#3:1:A>
Then Singapore nil and Trengganu nil but we witnessed at least three
golden opportunities to have scored

<ICE-SIN:S2A-004#4:1:A>
Singapore at least with one clear shot by Trengganu

<ICE-SIN:S2A-004#5:1:A>
That even that that didn't materialise

<ICE-SIN:S2A-004#6:1:A>
Certainly been a night of misses

<ICE-SIN:S2A-004#7:1:A>
So Trengganu going for that uh one point against Singapore here
happily in a second position up there right on top uh second only to Johor
then Trengganu then Sabah and Selangor

<ICE-SIN:S2A-004#8:1:A>
Singapore fighting very very hard to get into the uh quarter finals
and of course not to be uh relegated even

<ICE-SIN:S2A-004#9:1:A>
In the penalty area one uh is Leah trying

<ICE-SIN:S2A-004#10:1:A>
One went over the goal line

<ICE-SIN:S2A-004#11:1:A>
David Lee asking for the ball to be brought back and as the minutes
tick away

<ICE-SIN:S2A-004#12:1:A>
The fifty thousand here getting a little impatience

<ICE-SIN:S2A-004#13:1:A>
We've seen a good match an extremely good match but nothing to uh
to count for

<ICE-SIN:S2A-004#14:1:A>
Sudiah Dali on the left getting way pass the Randasander

<ICE-SIN:S2A-004#15:1:A>
Still with it

<ICE-SIN:S2A-004#16:1:A>
Now Singapore's uh uh Haslim a lovely ball there effectively right
across the field down to Zukifli

<ICE-SIN:S2A-004#17:1:A>
Now Singapore for triads with uh Jocky John falling down getting
himself up again but Trengganu now ledging themselves to this ball and
crossing it into the Singapore half

<ICE-SIN:S2A-004#18:1:A>
Singapore rushing down to defend

<ICE-SIN:S2A-004#19:1:A>
Still with the ball a long try

<ICE-SIN:S2A-004#20:1:A>
This must come from this man uh Zabric I think it is

<ICE-SIN:S2A-004#21:1:A>
Now the near side number fifteen Rosli Ishak

<ICE-SIN:S2A-004#22:1:A>
The man we saw coming in just now Nodi <unclear> word </unclear> of
Singapore managing to swat that attack down to Haskin Harun

<ICE-SIN:S2A-004#23:1:A>
Haslim from the centre

<ICE-SIN:S2A-004#24:1:A>
He streams <unclear> word </unclear> off the ball extremely well
down to Wing Onn on that very far side

<ICE-SIN:S2A-004#25:1:A>
Wing Onn trying to beat one man that man is Hasnan Ahmad

<ICE-SIN:S2A-004#26:1:A>
He doesn't quite get way pass that man and so Trengganu now
retaliate from their own half trying to get away

<ICE-SIN:S2A-004#27:1:A>
Referee saw that bit of pushing there uh by uh let's see now it was
uh Zukifli and he has awarded a free kick for Trengganu uh in their own half
just just about centre of their own half

<ICE-SIN:S2A-004#28:1:A>
Ball quickly taken

<ICE-SIN:S2A-004#29:1:A>
Ball goes down to Tusma Hosmak and Hosmak uh due to <unclear> word
</unclear> sends it back to his skipper Zubit Ibrahim

<ICE-SIN:S2A-004#30:1:A>
With great force uh challenging him in the process

<ICE-SIN:S2A-004#31:1:A>
Zubit drops tracks and drops gets off the head of uh Eusoff now
it's Saishuno and Shuko in a clash there with uh Trengganu boy

<ICE-SIN:S2A-004#32:1:A>
Tempers flaring and my goodness gracious me that was a bit
<unclear> word </unclear> going around

<ICE-SIN:S2A-004#33:1:A>
Here we have Malin Randa and there seem to be a little fight here
Roklin with Steven Daivd Lee coming in the thick of it all

<ICE-SIN:S2A-004#34:1:A>
Malin Vandasanda getting a little bit hot behind the collar growing
in the <unclear> word </unclear> there

<ICE-SIN:S2A-004#35:1:A>
But I think the referee has got the situation well in control

<ICE-SIN:S2A-004#36:1:A>
The police are coming and bar them on the track

<ICE-SIN:S2A-004#37:1:A>
The referee will certainly have to give the red card at least to at
least one or two one Singaporean I think also

<ICE-SIN:S2A-004#38:1:A>
But uh well let's see how the referee handle this situation

<ICE-SIN:S2A-004#39:1:A>
He's got Malin Vandasanda pulled into the side and he's also got
Said Shuko now Said Shuko was also instrumental in that little bit of flare
up

<ICE-SIN:S2A-004#40:1:A>
Said Shuko was brought down and now they've got their names taken
in the infamous book of the referee let's see the colour of the card that
comes off

<ICE-SIN:S2A-004#41:1:A>
Well you know looking from that angle they're now shifting my eyes
to the left we see drinks coming in and both the teams sharing a cup or two

<ICE-SIN:S2A-004#42:1:A>
We have Temas Hosmak

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-004#43:1:A>


<ICE-SIN:S2A-004#44:1:A>
A yellow card uh awarded to both Malin Vandasanda and Sye Said
Shuko

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-004#45:1:B>
That's pretty mild I would say because uh it was uh almost
bordering on uh a fist fights here at the National Stadium and I think a
yellow card to uh Malin Vandasanda and Singapore's Said Shuko I guess is a
fair a fair decision

<ICE-SIN:S2A-004#46:1:B>
But nevertheless having said that we still have that man in
Trengganu still on the ground

<ICE-SIN:S2A-004#47:1:B>
He's been there for the past three or four minutes

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-004#48:1:A>
and he is uh Rosli Ishak

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-004#49:1:B>
Right the man we saw coming in just will <unclear> word
</unclear> replacing Arifin Osman he was a man uh uh well I wouldn't say
instrumental but at least he was in the thick of it all the cause of little
uh fracas here at the National Stadium

<ICE-SIN:S2A-004#50:1:B>
Now he's been uh uh place on a stretcher and uh carried off by four

<ICE-SIN:S2A-004#51:1:B>
I think they must be from Saint Saint John's ambulance

<ICE-SIN:S2A-004#52:1:B>
Brian

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-004#53:1:A>
Uh one of the reasons uh Malin Vandasanda lost his uh cool for
a moment was because uh Said Shoko the man who uh inflicted that uh injury on
Rosli Ishak and hadn't scratched it out but oh but he's up and he's back into
the field of play once again so it makes you wonder whether that was serious
enough to warrant that incident

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-004#54:1:B>
You know Brian that is the epitome of play acting

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-004#55:1:A>
As I was saying uh Malin Vandasanda is very very frustrated
because Said Shuko has been doing an extremely good job of shackling him and
uh this of course uh gave him the opportunity of uh pushing Said Shuko and
trying to take the law into his own hands

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-004#56:1:B>
You know uh it is very very humourous because there was Rosli
Ishak in the thick of it all

<ICE-SIN:S2A-004#57:1:B>
He was trying to gain the sympathy of the referee

<ICE-SIN:S2A-004#58:1:B>
He was lying motionless on the field of play for about three
minutes

<ICE-SIN:S2A-004#59:1:B>
He even had the stretcher transported from the field of play out of
the field of play and when he looked around he had found that everyone a
yellow card

<ICE-SIN:S2A-004#60:1:B>
He bounced back got himself off the stretcher and ran back and took
up position

<ICE-SIN:S2A-004#61:1:B>
Now that is I think uh warrants a contract a contract probably with
SBC

<ICE-SIN:S2A-004#62:1:B>
I've seen a lot of things in these past years Brian but that I
think I must really take my hat off to him

<ICE-SIN:S2A-004#63:1:B>
On the you you gonna say something are you

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-004#64:1:A>
Well anyway well he didn't want to see his team down uh to ten
men and uh in fact he sees a replacement for Arifin Osmund so he had to get
back into the thick of action

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-004#65:1:B>
Well now it's Trengganu then one uh is uh well have ball is
got the ball shot right across the head of uh Zulkifi

<ICE-SIN:S2A-004#66:1:B>
It still uh uh little bit of dangerous situation for Singapore
because the action was dated back

<ICE-SIN:S2A-004#67:1:B>
Now Greg Foster Greg Foster for letting a true ball on the far side
of the field

<ICE-SIN:S2A-004#68:1:B>
Can Jocky John get himself to the ball

<ICE-SIN:S2A-004#69:1:B>
No he can't

<ICE-SIN:S2A-004#70:1:B>
Greg was in for the for second attempt then

<ICE-SIN:S2A-004#71:1:B>
He gets himself to the ball then a very side

<ICE-SIN:S2A-004#72:1:B>
Is that uh uh Ushami Lock Wing Onn

<ICE-SIN:S2A-004#73:1:B>
Now on the near side here this is <unclear> word </unclear>

<ICE-SIN:S2A-004#74:1:B>
The long ball coming to the sidelines here grim slightly uh uh
Trengganu half

<ICE-SIN:S2A-004#75:1:B>
Hasni trying to get it back into play again a push out to touch

<ICE-SIN:S2A-004#76:1:B>
And Hasim will just have to content with just a throw in

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-004#77:1:A>
Well the pace of this uh match is really fast and furious as
both teams go for one another

<ICE-SIN:S2A-004#78:1:A>
Singapore desperately needing to win Trengganu trying to hold on to
at least a goal as draw and come away with a point

<ICE-SIN:S2A-004#79:1:A>
Share points here with Singapore in Singapore's home tie in this
semi-pro cup tie against Trengganu and there's still no score at the moment

<ICE-SIN:S2A-004#80:1:A>
Trengganu in attack a long ball <unclear> word </unclear> the top
of the Singapore penalty area to the head of Malin Vandasandan who knocks it
down to Wan Izila keeps it in play and he sends it to Rosli Ishak back to Wan
Izila

<ICE-SIN:S2A-004#81:1:A>
Izila's his ball across the ball to Malin Vandasandan and it's the
boys Sulia Dali into the middle of the pitch it goes

<ICE-SIN:S2A-004#82:1:A>
It's anybody ball as the ball uh keeps on <unclear> word </unclear>
and leaving and Haslim Harun picks it up and he went straight into the
Trengganu defence defeats one two three but not the third man

<ICE-SIN:S2A-004#83:1:A>
He was beaten there by the Trengganu defender Zabri Mohammud Nor
doing very well

<ICE-SIN:S2A-004#84:1:A>
Rosli Ishak picks it up in mid-field right now but he couldn't keep
control of the ball it goes to touch

<ICE-SIN:S2A-004#85:1:A>
Corner throw in to Singapore to be taken by Singapore's left
quarter-back Sudia Dali

<ICE-SIN:S2A-004#86:1:A>
Dali very quickly down to Foster

<ICE-SIN:S2A-004#87:1:A>
Foster juggling the ball looking for a teammate

<ICE-SIN:S2A-004#88:1:A>
He finds Zulkifli

<ICE-SIN:S2A-004#89:1:A>
Zulkifli sending it back to Foster

<ICE-SIN:S2A-004#90:1:A>
The goal-keeper was out of position

<ICE-SIN:S2A-004#91:1:A>
That's the reason why the crowd <unclear> word </unclear>

<ICE-SIN:S2A-004#92:1:A>
Foster to get on with the game and uh apparently the defender who
stopped Haslim from uh going through on his own was Zabri Mohammud Nor

<ICE-SIN:S2A-004#93:1:A>
He's flat on the ground and the goal-keeper Zubir Ibrahim wanted to
bring the referee's attention to this injured player Zabri Mohammud Nor and
he was completely out of position whereas the referee allowed play to
continue and he was in a situation where he would have been out of position
had uh Foster crossed the ball earlier and Singapore would have scored and he
was very very upset

<ICE-SIN:S2A-004#94:1:A>
He wanted to go for the referee but one of his defenders stopped
him from doing so and attention now that play has been halted

<ICE-SIN:S2A-004#95:1:A>
ttention has been given to this injured player Zabri Mohammud Nor
and he's been taken care of

<ICE-SIN:S2A-004#96:1:A>
Right now the stretcher boys are on the pitcher play and they've
got him on a stretcher and he's got to go to the far side of the field

<ICE-SIN:S2A-004#97:1:A>
In the meantime uh I think a goal kick is gonna be given to
Trengganu

<ICE-SIN:S2A-004#98:1:A>
We've got something like uh thirty-five thirty-six minutes of play
gone by thirty-six minutes of play gone by in this second-half

<ICE-SIN:S2A-004#99:1:A>
Trengganu nil Singapore nil

<ICE-SIN:S2A-004#100:1:A>
Goal kick taken by their keepers Zabir Ibrahim right into the
middle of the pitch it goes

<ICE-SIN:S2A-004#101:1:A>
Singapore picking it up

<ICE-SIN:S2A-004#102:1:A>
Haslim Harun with the ball relays it to Foster

<ICE-SIN:S2A-004#103:1:A>
Foster down to Wing Onn yes and a shot here

<ICE-SIN:S2A-004#104:1:A>
A golden opportunity for Singapore to score and Wing Onn turned
around very quickly with his left leg he putted towards his Trengganu goal

<ICE-SIN:S2A-004#105:1:A>
The goal-keeper was out of position but uh fortunately for
Trengganu the ball went high and wide for a goal kick

<ICE-SIN:S2A-004#106:1:A>
So they live again to fight and they intend to do just that as
they match Singapore in pace and determination keeping their score lying
clean

<ICE-SIN:S2A-004#107:1:A>
No score at the moment

<ICE-SIN:S2A-004#108:1:A>
Singapore desperately needing to win as Trengganu come back right
now

<ICE-SIN:S2A-004#109:1:A>
Malin Vandasanda with the ball

<ICE-SIN:S2A-004#110:1:A>
In the Singapore half he comes at the top of the bucks

<ICE-SIN:S2A-004#111:1:A>
He crosses only for Boran Ahdusamad to clear

<ICE-SIN:S2A-004#112:1:A>
Over to Haslim

<ICE-SIN:S2A-004#113:1:A>
Haslim bringing the ball forward

<ICE-SIN:S2A-004#114:1:A>
Playing the fetch and carry role

<ICE-SIN:S2A-004#115:1:A>
He crosses the ball to the far side over to Wing Onn

<ICE-SIN:S2A-004#116:1:A>
Wing Onn is free

<ICE-SIN:S2A-004#117:1:A>
He's got one man to beat now

<ICE-SIN:S2A-004#118:1:A>
He beats the man crosses the ball yes and it's clear the way by
Zagariah Musah

<ICE-SIN:S2A-004#119:1:A>
And he's clearing to touch for a touch in to Singapore

<ICE-SIN:S2A-004#120:1:A>
What exciting moments here in the National Stadium as the fifty
thousand fans rise and cheer

<ICE-SIN:S2A-004#121:1:A>
All these exciting moments

<ICE-SIN:S2A-004#122:1:A>
They're enjoying it but what they really want is a goal from the
home team

<ICE-SIN:S2A-004#123:1:A>
Are they gonna get it

<ICE-SIN:S2A-004#124:1:A>
And we don't have very much time left

<ICE-SIN:S2A-004#125:1:A>
Trengganu I'm sure will be very very happy very pleased with
themselves if they can come away with a draw

<ICE-SIN:S2A-004#126:1:A>
Singapore in the mean time putting the pressure on Trengganu as
they get another corner

<ICE-SIN:S2A-004#127:1:A>
Haslim swings the ball in

<ICE-SIN:S2A-004#128:1:A>
Zubir got his uh hands behind that ball

<ICE-SIN:S2A-004#129:1:A>
There was a bit of a push on Zubir Ibrahim and the referee's
awarded the free kick to Trengganu Zubri </I>
