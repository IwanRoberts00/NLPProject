Q5 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-018#2:1>
The structural approach to
language development empahsises on the analysis of the produced forms or
linguistic items as opposed to the functional/interactional approach which
sees language as a means of communication, the interact, that is, a more
social perspective as opposed to the former which more linguistic in
perspective. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-018#3:1>
One of the structural approaches to
language development is the Behaviourist Model which believes that language
is a result of habit-forming. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-018#4:1>
The most famous model was
that proposed by Skinner with Stimulus-Response Hypothesis which he likened
language acquisition to that of reacting to the environment.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-018#5:1>
The stimulus, like the classic example of Pavlov's
dog-experiment, who salivated at the sound of a bell. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-018#6:1>
Skinner thought that this was the best example of what conditioning does to
language. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-018#7:1>
In terms of the child, his arms are
outstretched when the mother or caregiver carries. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-018#8:1>
Therefore, this is a form of stimulus where he will stretch his arms whenever
he wants to be carried, therefore language operates it in the same way.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-018#9:1>
However, the biggest weakness of this approach is that
it does not take into consideration utterances that are not a direct or
indirect result of stimulus. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-018#10:1>
For Skinner, only the
presence of a stimulus will bring about a response. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-018#11:1>
Although children talk to gain attention or convey their needs, they also
engage in egocentric talk where it has no apparent purpose or is a direct
result of any stimulus from his environment. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-018#12:1>
For
Chomsky, although his Innateness Hypothesis can to a great extent explain the
rule-forming and rule-testing, his denial of the influence or necessity of
caregivers for language development does not help to account for children who
do not learn to speak when they were cut off from human contact.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-018#13:1>
Examples of wolf-boys or children shut up in attics
that do not learn language seem to indicate that interaction is important for
the child to acquire language. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-018#14:1>
Chomsky sees linguistic
input as degenerated and they enter a " black box" known as : Language
Acquisition Device" ( LAD where the child is able to internalise those forms
and produces them in his linguistic output. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-018#15:1>
The child
forms his theory or rules about the language in the LAD and tests them.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-018#16:1>
This is true about children who are impervious to
correction and do not imitate forms as the behaviourists suggest but rather
form their own theories and rules about the language and stick on to them
until they have found others to replace them. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-018#17:1>
The
behaviourists believe that children learn through imitation and therefore
dismiss the replacement rule. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-018#18:1>
This is erroneous as can
be seen from children's acquisition of limited forms of the past tense but
discarding them when he overgeneralises or overapplies the rule and refuses
to be corrected regardless of correction, explicit or implicit.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-018#19:1>
Functionalists and interactionsists on the other hand
view interaction and socialisation as a more important aspect of language.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-018#20:1>
For Wells, he sees language acquisition as a
collaborative affair which requires the co-operation between the child and
the care giver. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-018#21:1>
The child is able to learn language
only through interaction with others, it is able then to test his hypothesis
or rules about the language with his caregiver. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-018#22:1>
For MC
Tear, he used the " conversation structure" to account for the rule
confirmation or whether the utterance is acceptable to the hearer.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-018#23:1>
In fact, for interactionsts, it seems to be that
experience is an important factor in shaping language for the child acquires
language as a direct result of interacting with adults.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-018#24:1>
This seems to be plausible as exemplified by the
tendency of children to talk incessantly once they have acquired speech and
indicate their solidarity and camaraderie with people whom they are most
willing to talk to or talk the most to. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-018#25:1>
Speech acts is
a more important consideration to interactionists where the child learns
acceptable rules of the appropriate time and place to say certain things
rather than producing the correct forms. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-018#26:1>
This is
indicated by a response to the former expression or initiation of a new topic
of the other party. </I>

<ICE-SIN:W1A-018#27:2>
Q8 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-018#28:2>
Krashen's Comprehensible
Input Hypothesis assumes that all data has to be comprehensible to the child
before he is able to Acura it. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-018#29:2>
Otherwise, the child
would be unable to internalise it and will not become part of his system.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-018#30:2>
In fact, Krashen is against the pure linguistic
classes as he sees it as utterly useless to the child's understanding and
acquisition of language. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-018#31:2>
Krashen prefers a lesson
whose content and main objective is not aimed at target linguistic items but
rather that of a science or geography class which does not highlight a
particular characteristic of the language. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-018#32:2>
This is
because Krashen believes that in order for a child to pick up a certain item,
the teacher must provide a wider " net" that consists of rough-tuned items
such that the child will be able to pick up the intended.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-018#33:2>
Krashen used I+i to stand for " coveted" item and
I+ii, I+iii and etc to stand for other available items which are not the "
targeted" item or what Singaporeans would in Singapore's terms call " beyond
the syllabus" or " not in the syllabus". 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-018#34:2>
By spreading
such a net, the child is then able to pick up the item concerned.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-018#35:2>
This can be seen as a form of challenge to the child
who is exposed to more difficult forms than he has thought to be capable of
producing. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-018#36:2>
In certain cases, the child might even be
able to pick up the forms that were not meant for him. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-018#37:2>
The Comprehensible Input Hypothesis seems to promote a more functional
approach to language in that language is use in the transmission of
information other than linguistic knowledge. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-018#38:2>
It seems
to endorse Macnamara's suggestion for a more authentic classroom situation
where children learn language while engaged in play such as baking or cooking
lessons. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-018#39:2>
If a child is able to learn more effectively
when engaged in interaction and in a stress-free environment, then the
comprehensible input Hypothesis does seem to be more helpful in the planning
of the syllabus for children in Singapore schools. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-018#40:2>
In
Singapore schools, the main objective of education seems to be in preparing
the children for examinations. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-018#41:2>
Therefore, the teacher
has to cover the whole syllabus regardless whether the students are able to
understand or absorb the data. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-018#42:2>
This is in opposition
to Krashen's hypothesis in that the language has to be comprehensible before
the child is able to acquire or learn it. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-018#43:2>
The system
in Singapore does not take into consideration the differences in the
abilities of the children as the data may be comprehensible to some but not
others. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-018#44:2>
Such a situation is worst for children in
lower primary who are not yet streamed according to their abilities.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-018#45:2>
The difference in understanding between the best pupil
and the poorest is so great that the teacher cannot do enough to challenge
the bright and yet take care of the weak. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-018#46:2>
Therefore,
the " net" that the teacher has to spread is constrained by such conditions.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-018#47:2>
The size of the classes also prevents the teachers
from catering to the individual need of the children. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-018#48:2>
In any form of play, the children have to take turns and the lesson or time
allotted is too short for them to actually engage in what is other than the
highlighting of characteristic features of the language and learning by rote
and drilling which is the most orderly and viable means to the teacher.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-018#49:2>
Unless the classes can be reduced to half or a third
of its present size, very little can be adapted from our understanding of
Krashen's hypothesis to help or improve the language development in Singapore
schools. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-018#50:2>
However, Krashen's hypothesis also presents
certain problems in that we do not know how the teacher is supposed to grade
I+i, I+ii in terms of its difficulty. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-018#51:2>
Difficulty is
subjective to different learners. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-018#52:2>
In Singapore, as the
main objective of education seems to be passing examinations, topics or items
that are not acquired by the child will result in his failure in the
examinations. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-018#53:2>
Therefore, Krashen's hypothesis does not
appear to be too valid in Singapore's context. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-018#54:2>
Unless
Singapore is able to move away from its stress on examination to the quality
of learning or language development in this case, Krashen's Hypothesis can
only be applied with very limited results as can be seen from the lower
primary education which have activities-based lessons like REAP but the
mainstream education would still be highly dependent upon drills and learning
by rote. </I>

Q4 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-018#56:3>
The difficulty in
learning the second school language could be the effect of lack of authentic
situations or the need in using the language. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-018#57:3>
In the
case of Macnamara's study, where children were able to communicate
effectively or acquire the language more efficiently from peers and friends
because of the need to identify with them. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-018#58:3>
In the case
of difficulty in the second school language, the child may not be able to see
the actual use or necessity of learning it. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-018#59:3>
Another
difficulty may be presented in the lack of understanding the distance between
the two languages as proposed by the Contrastive Analysis Hypothesis ( CA).

<ICE-SIN:W1A-018#60:3>
Certain linguistic rules may be more difficult to
acquire because they are not present in the first language.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-018#61:3>
The case given was the use of relative clauses in
Arabic and Chinese. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-018#62:3>
However, for children whose home
or first language is English, the difficulty may arise in the use of
quantifiers where different quantifiers are used for countable nouns and
uncountable nouns in Chinese. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-018#63:3>
English only has a class
of quantifiers for countable and another for uncountable nouns.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-018#64:3>
Chinese has different quantifiers within countable
nouns and uncountable nouns. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-018#65:3>
Therefore, one such
difficulty may be present. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-018#66:3>
According to the CA, by
knowing the difficulties, the teacher may then emphasize or have more time
allotted for the teaching for these items. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-018#67:3>
However,
there has been no mention of such a consideration in the compilation of
syllabuses for the second languages. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-018#68:3>
The child's
attitude towards the language may be another barrier to the child's learning
as according to Krashen's Affective Filter Hypothesis, it may form as a block
to the child's learning. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-018#69:3>
The child may also lack a
hypothesis testing ground as his family members may only communicate in
English and not the second language. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-018#70:3>
If the
interactionist approach to language is correct, then the child may be
deprived of an environment of people to interact with apart from his language
teachers. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-018#71:3>
This second language is also learnt rather
than acquired naturally because it is done in a classroom environment and may
thus put off the child. </I>

<I> 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-018#72:4>
Q3 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-018#73:4>
In the home environment,
the linguistic input for the child comes from the caregiver.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-018#74:4>
It also makes use of authentic situations and language
is used as a means of communication rather than to develop the child
cognitively or linguistically. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-018#75:4>
The caregiver is
usually less concerned with the form that is produced but with the truth
value. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-018#76:4>
rather, the child is able to acquire the forms
at his own pace and is not punished for the " incorrect" or deviant forms
that he produces. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-018#77:4>
The context of the home is also
informal. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-018#78:4>
In comparison, the setting of the school or
classroom is formal. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-018#79:4>
The teacher also has a planned
syllabus as to what linguistic items are to be taught for the week.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-018#80:4>
In Singapore, teachers enter all the linguistic items,
such as spelling lists, use of past tense or the Perfect tense into their
record books. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-018#81:4>
The lessons are then structured in a way
whereby all the linguistic input for the child comes in the form of the use
of past tense, be it in story-telling, by rote or drills.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-018#82:4>
This is in opposition to the learner's syllabus that
every child has. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-018#83:4>
All the activities conducted in the
class will be towards the teacher's syllabus. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-018#84:4>
Instead
of an environment of love and acceptance, the child is subject to overt
correction of his " mistakes", deviations from the norm.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-018#85:4>
In certain cases, the child may even be punished for
such forms, such as not getting a " star" on his book. <X>

<ICE-SIN:W1A-018#X86:4>
The child is rarely praised if he produces the
correct form yet punished if he does the opposite. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-018#X87:4>
The learning that takes place is also not authentic as the child is required
to give the correct form rather than the correct communicative act which is
what the child is exposed to in the home environment. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-018#X88:4>
School also places a heavier emphasis on the written form than the spoken
form. 

<ICE-SIN:W1A-018#X89:4>
At the age of 5 to 6, the child is merely at
the stage of concrete operations, according to Piaget, therefore, it may be
difficult for him to visualise any connection between the spoken and written
as the latter is more abstract. </X> </I>
