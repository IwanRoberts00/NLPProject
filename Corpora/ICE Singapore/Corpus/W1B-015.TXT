Dearest Regina,

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#2:1>
27th November 1994.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#3:1>
A tab is a bill, you dope.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#4:1>
It means I will owe you til I can pay you back.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#5:1>
Thank you for the cream.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#6:1>
I really appreciate it.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#7:1>
You are such a nice sister.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#8:1>
Call Kalthom at 4534106 and pass it to her.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#9:1>
Ask Jo not to send the hair oil, if she hasn't sent it yet, I'll make
do with VO5 hair oil, which isn't very good but it'll do for 3 months.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#10:1>
Ask her to pass it to Kalthom to bring it back next year.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#11:1>
Merci Beaucoup!

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#12:1>
Life on this floor is now very different, as you can see I now have a
computer.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#13:1>
It's not mine actually, it belongs to Stuart.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#14:1>
But I get to use it anytime I like.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#15:1>
I play games on it everyday.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#16:1>
I am hooked on tetris and taipei and minesweeper.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#17:1>
I also have got a TV in my room as well as a shelf for it thanks top
Matt.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#18:1>
Matt is my neighbour and he has gone back to Wellington.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#19:1>
He is Andrea's boyfriend and Andrea has gone back to Singapore.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#20:1>
In fact, most of my friends have gone back to their homelands.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#21:1>
On this floor, I still have Stuart, room 356, Ronald, room 349,
Scott, room 317.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#22:1>
The rest of the floor is taken up by new people, some of them kiddies
that I can't stand.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#23:1>
The lady who took over Matt's room is Ana, a Portuguese lady.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#24:1>
She reminds me of Aunty Connie.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#25:1>
Thomas ( my German friend) & his girlfriend Barbel ( last name
Oswald) have gone on their 4 week trip to South Island, so almost all the old
gang have left.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#26:1>
It like living on a kid's floor, thanks to Geshan our warden, who has
stacked this floor with people he likes, and there not many of those people
around.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#27:1>
Ronald was telling us that a lot of people are going to send in some
letters of complaint to the accommodation office.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#28:1>
I am suppose to send in my letter of complaint as well.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#29:1>
I want to add my two bits about how he threatened my accommodation
reference letter when he alleged that I said something bad about him.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#30:1>
He got so personal and as warden he should not.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#31:1>
I got mad because I didn't say anything about him and got blamed for
it.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#32:1>
He refused to listen to me at all as he had already made up his
stubborn mind.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#33:1>
When Stuart, his good friend, talked to him about the whole matter,
he realised his mistake but was too pig-headed to apologies.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#34:1>
After the matter blew over, he was very nice to me.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#35:1>
I think it is because of Stuart hate people who abuse their power, as
Geshan has done.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#36:1>
Stuart took me to Dennys for dinner on Monday, that was the day his
little brother ( by the way, he is over 6 feet and 3 feet wide) flew to
England.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#37:1>
His friends bought him 10 beers before he flew on United Airline (
plane was delayed due to mechanical failure), so we wished him luck.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#38:1>
I know Craig personally as Stuart introduced my to him earlier in the
year.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#39:1>
Work is getting mundane although my colleagues are very nice.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#40:1>
I get to meet a lot of student, some of whom I met again when I went
to see 'The Specialist'.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#41:1>
Stu and I had steamboat with Ferdy from the 2nd floor and this girl,
Angeline, whom he has the hots for.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#42:1>
Angeline said I look familiar and I told her I work at Student Job
Search.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#43:1>
She then said, " oh, yah, that's right, you registered me!" It was
quite funny.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#44:1>
I also met Angeline's flatmate.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#45:1>
Susanna at the cinema.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#46:1>
No, not me, another girl who's name is spelled exactly the same as
mine.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#47:1>
I know because I also registered her at SJS.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#48:1>
She saw me and greeted me rather warmly.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#49:1>
No hugs though.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#50:1>
I rather like the weather here at the moment.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#51:1>
It is glorious, with the sun shining brightly and warmly, with a cool
breeze to take away the sting of the sun's rays on the skin.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#52:1>
I take quite a lot of walks.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#53:1>
Unfortunately, I also eat quite alot so I have not lost the
additional weight I gained.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#54:1>
Come to think of it, I am quite plump.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#55:1>
I got Singapore Airlines postcard from JuEe & Jennie the other day,
and one from Kalthom who wrote from Melaka.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#56:1>
I also received a postcard from Thomas, it was Mitre Peak.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#57:1>
He said that he loved Stewart Island but hated Invercargill.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#58:1>
Wee Ching sent a letter also, strange letter.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#59:1>
He wrote " I have arrived in one peace in New Zealand"(where does he
think he is?)" I had quite a peaceful journey and thankfully did not suffer
and sexual harassment by Andrea who strangely went to the toilet many many
times" He said that the Christmas lights are up in Singapore.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#60:1>
I am missing home alot now, as I would have loved Orchard Rd with my
sisters and enjoy the lights.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#61:1>
I got Ronald a job selling xmas cards.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#62:1>
I also got Simon a job at a factory, Anthony selling xmas cards as
well and this Fijian guy a factory job.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#63:1>
I can't remember his name but he saw me at the lobby of Huia and
thanked me for the introduction.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#64:1>
Stu just got a part time job at the motel opposite Huia.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#65:1>
Its Grafton Oaks Motel.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#66:1>
Doing the laundry.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#67:1>
Ha!

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#68:1>
Ha!

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#69:1>
Ha!

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#70:1>
Watch out for dirty towels.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#71:1>
He is quite happy with it though.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#72:1>
Its better than loafing around and waiting for the dole to roll in.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#73:1>
Stuart also did a 4 hour job for
&dollar;35 cash yesterday.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#74:1>
I rang him and asked if he wanted the job of packing T-shirts.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#75:1>
It sounded east enough.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#76:1>
But when he got there, he packed T-shirts, shifted bricks,
photocopied files and painted round the office.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#77:1>
He told me he did so much work, its not worth
&dollar;35!!! 

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#78:1>
Anyway, that's
&dollar;35 more to spend.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#79:1>
There was also another 4 hour job helping some researchers at the med
school move furniture.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#80:1>
It was on a Sat.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#81:1>
morning so I did it along with Stuart and Charles ( my colleague) and
Josh ( and Australian guy doing a tourism diploma here).

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#82:1>
I got
&dollar;40 cash.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#83:1>
Not bad, eh?

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#84:1>
It was hard work though, I woke up on Sunday with aches and pains all
over and could hardly move.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#85:1>
Stayed in bed most of the day.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#86:1>
I did go for meet though.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#87:1>
The uni results are coming in so..oo slowly, its unbelievable.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#88:1>
So far, I have got 2 of my results.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#89:1>
B for management and C for calculus.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#90:1>
I am quite satisfied with mgt.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#91:1>
accounting but not calculus.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#92:1>
I don't seem to have a knack for maths.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#93:1>
I study like mad and get only a C.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#94:1>
Thankfully, I do 3 accounting papers next year, so I should get alot
more better results next year.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#95:1>
I also have devised new study methods suitable for me, which I can't
wait to implement next year.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#96:1>
Will write and let you know the rest of my results.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#97:1>
By the way, be a kind soul and do look for my chalet school series
and do a stock take for me.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#98:1>
They have the latest ones here in the bookshop and I want to complete
my set.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#99:1>
Please!?

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#100:1>
Meanwhile take care and write soon.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#101:1>
Your sister,

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#102:1>
Susanna. </I>

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#103:2>
Dearest Regina,

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#104:2>
1st January 1995

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#105:2>
Thanks for buying the cream for me.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#106:2>
I am unable to contact Kalthom at all.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#107:2>
Call Jin instead.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#108:2>
She is Kalthom's best friend.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#109:2>
Her Phone no. is 4596870.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#110:2>
Tell her you have got something for me and you want to pass it to
Kalthom to bring over to NZ.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#111:2>
Maybe you could make arrangements with her to meet Kalthom.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#112:2>
Everything is routine and as usual around here.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#113:2>
I am still working at Student Job Search and had 4 statutory
holidays, 2 at xmas and 2 for new year, which is on Mon and Tue.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#114:2>
I intend to relax and clean up my room which is due for a thorough
cleaning.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#115:2>
Don't worry, I am still looking after my spiritually.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#116:2>
Hong Mei Mei just wrote to me.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#117:2>
Her letter is so spiritual, I am not sure what to write to her.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#118:2>
Any suggestions?

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#119:2>
I have gotten No.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#120:2>
14 Whitaker Place for the new academic year and am slowly packing to
move.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#121:2>
Matt, my ex-neighbour, is in Singapore at the moment with Andrea.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#122:2>
Andrea rang me to ask what papers I am doing in my 2nd year and we
had a chat.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#123:2>
She said she is glad Matt is there with her.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#124:2>
Matt is feeling extremely hot but is surviving alright.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#125:2>
Auckland is hot at the moment too, Glorious weather, with the sun
shining, clear blue sky and cool winds.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#126:2>
The perfect weather.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#127:2>
Hot!

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#128:2>
Hot!

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#129:2>
Hot!

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#130:2>
During the xmas hols, I went down to Gisborne with Stuart and had a
fabulous holiday.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#131:2>
It was an 8 hour drive down.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#132:2>
It is hot at Gisborne, as hot as Singapore.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#133:2>
Luckily, Gisborne is situated at the East Coast, so we had cool
winds to keep us cool.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#134:2>
I met Stuart's parents, Rena and Dexter, and they are very nice.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#135:2>
I got the guest bedroom, which Stuart said he had always wanted to
stay in.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#136:2>
Ha!

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#137:2>
Ha!

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#138:2>
He stayed in his own room.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#139:2>
He told his parents that I don't celebrate xmas but I got presents
anyway.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#140:2>
They say it's a 'welcome to our home' gift.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#141:2>
They are very hospitable people.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#142:2>
Stuart told them I am a typical tourist and they took me round to
see the sights of Gisborne, such as Kaiti Hill, Capt.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#143:2>
Cook's landing site, Wylie Cottage ( the oldest cottage in
Gisborne), the museum etc.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#144:2>
I think they enjoyed it as much as I did.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#145:2>
I really enjoyed myself as I had free accommodation, free food and
contributed only
&dollar;40 to Stuart for the petrol.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#146:2>
Cheap holiday!!!

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#147:2>
We spent Sat, Sun.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#148:2>
and Mon.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#149:2>
there and drove back on Tuesday.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#150:2>
Then it was back to work on Wed, Thu and Fri.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#151:2>
On Fri night, Ronald organised a group to see " Timecop" starring
Claude Vam Damme, and invited me.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#152:2>
So I went.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#153:2>
There were about 7 of us.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#154:2>
The show was quite good.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#155:2>
One of Claude Van Damme's better movies.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#156:2>
Then I spent New Years Eve with my colleague, Kill, and her
boyfriend Ray.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#157:2>
Stuart was invited too, so the four of us had a cozy chatting and
playing board games, Cluedo and a game invented by Ray.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#158:2>
We were so involved in the boardgame, we didn't realise that the new
year had arrived.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#159:2>
Stuart and I went home at about 2am.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#160:2>
We had lunch and dinner there with Ray and Jill.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#161:2>
Very nice people.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#162:2>
That's about it.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#163:2>
Hope you are having a good time.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#164:2>
Do write soon.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#165:2>
Even a short letter would be appreciated.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#166:2>
Hope to hear from you soon.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#167:2>
Love,

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#168:2>
Susanna. </I>

<I>

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#169:3>
Dearest Regina,

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#170:3>
7th February 1995.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#171:3>
Sorry for not writing earlier as I have been busy.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#172:3>
I have been working at Auckland Domain ( a big park) at 23 major
events on 2 Saturdays consecutively.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#173:3>
You would have loved to be there!

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#174:3>
On 28th Jan., there was the Opera-in-the-park.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#175:3>
Not so famous opera singers sang pieces from different opera like
Rigoletto and Faust ( I think).

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#176:3>
I worked at fast food stand, selling hotdogs and hot chips.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#177:3>
I enjoyed the finale more than anything else.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#178:3>
They had everyone singing from Rigoletto, I am not sure which piece,
fireworks and laser al at one time.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#179:3>
It was fabulous!!!

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#180:3>
So beautiful and romantic.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#181:3>
Many people ( about 200,000) slowly streamed in.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#182:3>
The kiasu ones came as early as 10 am to 'chop' the front area.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#183:3>
Forget to tell you that its all FREE.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#184:3>
Some brought wine glasses and snacks.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#185:3>
I really wished you were here as I know you would have really
enjoyed and appreciated it.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#186:3>
On the following Saturday, 4th Feb, they had Symphony-on-the-park.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#187:3>
You would even like this better.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#188:3>
The orchestra may not have been famous, but it played beautiful
music from Mozart, Beethoven, Strauss etc. <X>

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#X189:3>
They had opera singers who sang Phantom of the Opera, and some
other pieces I can't remember.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#X190:3>
Again the finale had fireworks and laser.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#X191:3>
And...

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#X192:3>
its all FREE!!!

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#X193:3>
I worked again at this event for the same employer, and each time
earned
&dollar;70, working from 4pm to 11pm The concert started at 7.30 pm on both times
and ended about 10.45pm.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#X194:3>
Since I lice near the Domain, I walked home amidst 10,000s of
people.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#X195:3>
So claustrophobic!!

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#X196:3>
I squeezed and walked and swerved and ran round the people, else I
would be walking and stopping all the time.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#X197:3>
After working at Symphony-on-the-park, I fell sick.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#X198:3>
I am recovering from my flu even as I am typing this letter.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#X199:3>
Must have caught the flu from one of the large throng.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#X200:3>
<SIGH> I went for the book study today though I didn't go on Sunday
as I was really sick.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#X201:3>
I spend Sunday and Monday in bed.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#X202:3>
Stuart took me to the pharmacy to buy some medicine.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#X203:3>
It cost me
&dollar;10.90 for the flu capsules.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#X204:3>
But evidently it works, as I am slowly getting better.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#X205:3>
I will be working for Student Job Search from the 13th Feb to the
24th Feb.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#X206:3>
So I will be very busy during the next 2 weeks, with working,
enrolling and moving into Whitaker Place.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#X207:3>
Will give you my new address soon Meanwhile, direct your mail here.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#X208:3>
How's life at home?

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#X209:3>
Hope all of you are holding out well.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#X210:3>
Now that dad's disowned us, we can get on with our lives without
him.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#X211:3>
Jah's blessings can now shower unhindered on our household, so pray
to Him and ask for his help and understanding.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#X212:3>
He will, I know He will..

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#X213:3>
So that's it for now.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#X214:3>
Do write soon.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#X215:3>
I will keep you inform of what's going on here in my life, which is
not much actually.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#X216:3>
I spend most of my time tidying up my room several times over, then
Stuart's room.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#X217:3>
It annoys him endlessly as he says he cannot find anything after I
put them away.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#X218:3>
Just like what dad used to say to mum.

And you know what?

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#X220:3>
Like mum, I cannot remember where I put things away.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#X221:3>
Ha!

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#X222:3>
Ha!

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#X223:3>
Ha!

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#X224:3>
Lucky he can put up with me.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#X225:3>
Take care.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#X226:3>

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#X227:3>

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#X228:3>
Love,

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#X229:3>
Susanna.

The MRT cards have money in them.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#X233:3>
Use it.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#X234:3>
By the time I come back, they're probably outdated.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#X235:3>
So..

<ICE-SIN:W1B-015#X236:3>
