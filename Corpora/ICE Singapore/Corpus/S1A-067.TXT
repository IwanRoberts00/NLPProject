<I>

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#1:1:A>
So when visitors come how is it

<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#2:1:A>
Do you have problems with them

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#3:1:B>
No I think is I mean your time is spent because of the whole
week you know like in this case when Joe is in town and being so called CBG
and now that I'm <unclear> word </unclear> and Kelvin is not around all the
meetings you know and all the discussion <unclear> word </unclear>

<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#4:1:B>
I mean

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#5:1:A>
What are you discussing

<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#6:1:A>
Budget

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#7:1:B>
Concern your budget your plan for next year that you meet the
budget you know

<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#8:1:B>
If your why is your budget so much your growth is not or not very
high you know

<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#9:1:B>
It's the same case lah

<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#10:1:B>
Every boss <unclear> word </unclear> or you know is are interested
in their own areas

<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#11:1:B>
All they care for is their areas you know like Ben nah Ben Lam
who'll be interested for Biotech

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#12:1:A>
Did he have meeting with you

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#13:1:B>
Not really he did

<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#14:1:B>
Ben doesn't really sit down meeting with me in the sense that but
he did ask me after the budget review yesterday count the numbers lah you
know whether I'm confident that I'll achieve those figures and how about
looking into the other areas and all that

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#15:1:A>
How do you find this boss

<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#16:1:A>
Are they good

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#17:1:B>
Uhm

<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#18:1:B>
Some some of them are not much help but so far Keith Chan uh seem
to be okay

<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#19:1:B>
I mean quite helpful in that sense you know but Ben I don't not not
really Ben Lam lah can't really said depend on him or what but Keith seem to
be quite okay but he's too new know what I mean

<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#20:1:B>
Got to wait and see how it it goes and uh what he says whether he
claims that he would help out you know whether he'll do it

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#21:1:A>
What what do you mean what kind of thing would they do for for
you all

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#22:1:B>
You see what they are saying now uh we don't liaise direct
with the US you know

<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#23:1:B>
We should liaise with the bum but sometimes it's quite difficult

<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#24:1:B>
Certain issue I go to him he has to go back to the international
people

<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#25:1:B>
So sometimes end up we'll be writing a fax lah

<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#26:1:B>
We see if we write to the international people we CC them we CC our
boss you know so many people

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#27:1:A>
But why what's the rationale for for you know having them
coordinate for you all

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#28:1:B>
Them you see them they were supposed to look into areas like
uhm maybe more of market development market opportunities and all

<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#29:1:B>
I mean they are supposed to be uh specialised in their area and
they go and look into ways that help us to increase our plan or programmes
you know increase increase our sales and all that lah

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#30:1:A>
Ya

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#31:1:B>
Then they're supposed in a way to coordinate for us instead of
us going to the US and say you know instead they're the only one that contact
the US office or whatever

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#32:1:A>
But why why did you say it's not working

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#33:1:B>
It's not working out that well because sometimes certain issue
they can't to re they can't help us to resolve

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#34:1:A>
Like what

<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#35:1:A>
Price issue or what

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#36:1:B>
Most areas of price issue that we have free hand as long as we
we know our standard course we can work on it you know

<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#37:1:B>
The only deviation so far that I'm working with uh that controls
our price to our distributors uh customers in Thailand

<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#38:1:B>
They control it because in the first place their demand is greater
than supply and

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#39:1:A>
It's true

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#40:1:B>
So you know they get the best they want a higher price

<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#41:1:B>
Other countries are willing to pay

<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#42:1:B>
Some of our Asia Pacific countries uh South Asia ah are not willing

<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#43:1:B>
We can't afford to pay that high

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#44:1:A>
So end up you can't sell right

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#45:1:B>
Ya you can't get the goods you may

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#46:1:A>
If that's the case how to set a budget if if the US quotes
that way

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#47:1:B>
No man in his

<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#48:1:B>
Then US sake the rest of you will say you can make this price then
we supply

<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#49:1:B>
There's a minimum price lah you have to have a minimum price lah

<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#50:1:B>
I mean no doubt we know it's quality product but it depends on
individual country status you know whether can they afford to pay that amount
of money

<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#51:1:B>
So sometimes quite difficult for us you know

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#52:1:A>
What if they work that way

<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#53:1:A>
What's the point of setting a budget

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#54:1:B>
<unclear> word </unclear> Uh

<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#55:1:B>
No I mean you that's the base lah that means that's your ASB then
you know with this amount of price how much you can sell

<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#56:1:B>
Then you work on it lah

<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#57:1:B>
Then you get a budget lah

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#58:1:A>
But if later

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#59:1:B>
What

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#60:1:A>
You bid for it you won't get it

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#61:1:B>
No no once no that's right they have this in this case like
highland <unclear> word </unclear> issue they have cater allocate you with
the thing so you let's say they ask you for a minimum price and we agreed

<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#62:1:B>
Okay our customers are willing to accept the minimum price then
they uh they ask how much quantity you want and you tell them this is the
quantity you want

<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#63:1:B>
Then if they can locate you the full amount they give you the full
amount

<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#64:1:B>
That means will be allocated quantities to you at this price then
that's it

<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#65:1:B>
No even if let's say in <unclear> word </unclear> in later stage uh
other countries are willing to pay higher they cannot give my allocated
quantity to them in that sense you see

<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#66:1:B>
But once I've agreed to this price during the budgeting time I'll
if my I'm allocated this quantity this quantity will be for me lah

<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#67:1:B>
But of course if I can't sell this quantity then there's another
issue lah

<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#68:1:B>
That means I didn't raise my budget you see

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#69:1:A>
Uhm

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#70:1:B>
Get what I mean

<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#71:1:B>
If I get can sell it I'll get it lah you know

<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#72:1:B>
If I can sell at this price I'll get it lah

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#73:1:A>
So that would mean before you uh present your budget you
actually have to strike an agreement with them

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#74:1:B>
They come up with us

<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#75:1:B>
It's only in highland we do

<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#76:1:B>
This is only highland because it's an exceptional case in the sense
that sometimes you don't have uhm but actually supply is I mean demand is
greater than supply

<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#77:1:B>
But certain other products too have a minimum like price but most
of the other places they don't

<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#78:1:B>
They have a recommended price in that sense that to sell it to your
distributors or whatever you see

<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#79:1:B>
Then it's up to you lah whether you how much issue you wanna make
you see

<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#80:1:B>
Thailand is only exception

<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#81:1:B>
Like just now when we're talking about the endoscope that we are
the only one with the endoscope

<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#82:1:B>
I mean it's such a rare that one they only have five for the let
say they're talking about manufacturing only five for the whole world
additional month

<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#83:1:B>
That's like you know allocation you know see who the gotta see who
is the they even choose whom to give the price the the sell the scope to

<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#84:1:B>
So they want somebody who is of uh can have act as a reference
centre you know and all that

<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#85:1:B>
So not everybody who wants it can get it in this case

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#86:1:A>
Endo endoscope is this the the fifth newest product

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#87:1:B>
No CBD products

<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#88:1:B>
LIS products

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#89:1:A>
What if I say don't

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#90:1:B>
More than heart wanna open companies

<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#91:1:B>
Can go in and sees like camera okay

<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#92:1:B>
Ya

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#93:1:A>
But why is it an open heart thing

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#94:1:B>
For this only an open heart surgery

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#95:1:A>
Why they make so few

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#96:1:B>
Capacity and all that <unclear> word </unclear>

<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#97:1:B>
It seems that the scope is not the issue it's the the catitus that
they use to put with the scope

<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#98:1:B>
It's like they have collection capacity problem is it

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#99:1:A>
But like they only make five sets to sell every year

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#100:1:B>
I don't know how many sets lah but they have like restricted
quantities ya

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#101:1:A>
So miserable

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#102:1:B>
Uhm

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#103:1:A>
How can we meet our sales target

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#104:1:B>
Hah

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#105:1:A>
How was Henry's presentation do you know

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#106:1:B>
I don't know

<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#107:1:B>
He seen and came out and tell me

<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#108:1:B>
I said how was it

<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#109:1:B>
Oh have to increase another two hundred dollars

<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#110:1:B>
Obviously you know where

<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#111:1:B>
I ask him where's that money gonna come from

<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#112:1:B>
Look's like I just contributed another hundred thousand

<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#113:1:B>
Terrible

<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#114:1:B>
Just like the other time when after the first review came back ah
he said oh we have to increase further says that the growth wasn't
satisfactory and ask Kelvin and myself to look into our area and Susan and
the best part is Kelvin increase the area under where CBG area which he's
handing to me

<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#115:1:B>
So that's why in the end what Henry says was you know Kelvin has
still got to share the responsibility you know of the budget figures for next
year because all those budget figures was put up by him

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#116:1:A>
This is Priya <unclear> word </unclear> always on leave

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#117:1:B>

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#118:1:A>
Is Henry always on leave

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#119:1:B>
Henry ah

<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#120:1:B>
Of course they don't

<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#121:1:B>
The last two months was because you know a lot of arrangement
going up to Malaysia because of Ben's visit and all that but this one because
he's going to have ex exam

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#122:1:A>

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#125:1:A>
Oh it's a bad time for them uh

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#126:1:B>
You know what happen today

<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#127:1:B>
We went for lunch

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#128:1:A>
Who

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#129:1:B>
Joe and Fu Leong two of us three of us in the Tanin
restaurant in Amara

<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#130:1:B>
Joe paid

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#131:1:A>
Thai restaurant

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#132:1:B>
Thai

<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#133:1:B>
So Joe paid for it

<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#134:1:B>
You know how much tip he gave the guy

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#135:1:A>
Ten dollars

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#136:1:B>
Twenty-one bucks

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#137:1:A>
Sing

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#138:1:B>
Sing

<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#139:1:B>
I mean you work on ten or fifteen per cent you see

<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#140:1:B>
Then I told him Joe by the way you know after he sign

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#141:1:A>
After all he's from US

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#142:1:B>
He's sign already then he say why didn't you tell me this

<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#143:1:B>
I said we didn't know you gonna give twenty-one dollars

<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#144:1:B>
So we told him normal in the practice here is we normally don't
encourage giving tips because it's already service charge you see

<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#145:1:B>
Matthew <unclear> word </unclear> he told him anyway if you want
to give normally you

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#146:1:A>
A dollar or two

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#147:1:B>
just give a few you know maybe five bucks the very most

<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#148:1:B>
I said well never mind the next time you come to this restaurant
they'll treat you pretty well

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#149:1:A>
So that that waiter must be smiling and smiling

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#150:1:B>
Ya

<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#151:1:B>
In fact when we went there they told us oh really you know
surprisingly it was quite empty but it was all reserved you know

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#152:1:A>
Wow

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#153:1:B>
They they told us no place

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#154:1:A>
I know I I heard the food is very good

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#155:1:B>
No bad lah but later Joe was complaining of the portion

<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#156:1:B>
This is miserable portion it's meant for a child

<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#157:1:B>
Eats uh he eats a lot you see then he told us there's no place
then the lady said oh if you don't mind it's directly under the air duct you
know air vent so it's very cold and say you can see the weather it's cold
because it was raining

<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#158:1:B>
She said do you mind

<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#159:1:B>
I said oh it doesn't matter we don't really mind because you know
Fu Leong and him won't mind the cold

<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#160:1:B>
First they are all so big and is Alice <unclear> word </unclear>
perspiring

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#161:1:A>
Anyway you all eating hot food

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#162:1:B>
Ya

<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#163:1:B>
That's why Joe said doesn't matter

<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#164:1:B>
That's why Joe was trying his luck there

<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#165:1:B>
Being Thai does it help

<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#166:1:B>
Can I get

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#167:1:A>
Being Thai does it help what

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#168:1:B>
To get a place

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#169:1:A>
He said that too

<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#170:1:A>
He say for our own Thai people can I get a place

<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#171:1:A>
Does he speak Thai

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#172:1:B>
Ya he speaks Thai

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#173:1:A>
Very fluently

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#174:1:B>
Yes

<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#175:1:B>
Surprising you know

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#176:1:A>
I'm surprise

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#177:1:B>
Ya

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#178:1:A>
So far it appears to me

<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#179:1:A>
No this when you compare to the Americans the Chinese-born or
Asian-born Americans are even more polite <X>

<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#X180:1:A>
Well good manners uh

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#X181:1:B>
True

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#X182:1:A>
compared to the real Americans

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#X183:1:B>
Definitely

<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#X184:1:B>
Tak boleh tahan them

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#X185:1:A>
True they're such snobs when they come to our office

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#X186:1:B>
I mean I could see that even when Joe talks to Roger

<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#X187:1:B>
Roger also is very

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#X188:1:A>
Rude

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#X189:1:B>
Rude

<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#X190:1:B>
I mean like no respect for the other person

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#X191:1:A>
No how does he respond to people

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#X192:1:B>
Heh

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#X193:1:A>
Just yell at him or what

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#X194:1:B>
Just yell lah

<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#X195:1:B>
He told him something on top of his voice you know what I mean

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-067#X196:1:A>
Because nobody tells him off </X> </I>
