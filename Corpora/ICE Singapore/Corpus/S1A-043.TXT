<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#24:1:B>

<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#25:1:B>

<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#26:1:C>
Hope there will be a lot people

<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#27:1:C>
Thirty over people in our whole trip lah

<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#28:1:C>
If there is just three of us then uh

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#29:1:B>

<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#31:1:A>
In a group they they will be more careful

<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#32:1:A>
We come from agencies <unclear> word </unclear>

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#33:1:B>

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#34:1:C>

<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#35:1:C>

<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#37:1:C>

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#38:1:B>
Never mind it is only four days

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#39:1:A>
The lady told me that the chances of getting the confirmed
flight back to Singapore is are good whenever they are

<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#40:1:A>
But if

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#41:1:C>
No uncertainty also ah ya

<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#42:1:C>
She may be worried

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#43:1:A>
That is the problem

<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#44:1:A>
I don't know how her definite <unclear> word </unclear> come back
gone

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#45:1:C>
It is quite true some people use this to make money using this
kind of thing

<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#46:1:C>
And then we won't go around to make again

<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#47:1:C>
Creatures of the night thing

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#48:1:A>
If that falls through then we have nowhere to go

<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#49:1:A>
That means we have to opt for the three day one

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#50:1:C>
No no

<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#51:1:C>
Why don't actually we can actually call them and ask them

<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#52:1:C>
If they pull through we can make other arrangement

<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#53:1:C>
But they can't just keep on offer when you promise us that
<unclear> word </unclear> right

<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#54:1:C>
Now they keep us on hold then we can't go to other agency

<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#55:1:C>
It is not fair you see

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#56:1:A>
So it is not that

<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#57:1:A>
If that is the case then we opt for a three day two night by then
hundred dollar cheaper

<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#58:1:A>
Two nine nine

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#59:1:B>
Oh they don't have that

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#60:1:A>
I think they don't have

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#61:1:B>
Oh

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#62:1:A>
Wait wait I ask

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#63:1:C>
Oh

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#64:1:C>
Oh room service <unclear> word </unclear>

<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#65:1:C>
You didn't tell me about <unclear> word </unclear>

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#66:1:A>
<unclear> word </unclear> fuss over this issue whereby they
delaying delaying us

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#67:1:B>
His cheapness is revealing

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#68:1:A>
What

<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#69:1:A>
He is getting cheaper by the hour

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#70:1:B>
<unclear> word </unclear> problem is just like we just be
going just one day

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#71:1:A>
Well if we find a seat early the morning

<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#72:1:A>
We come up come back late at night

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#73:1:C>
I ask Ronald when I was <unclear> word </unclear> three day
four night lah <unclear> word </unclear>

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#74:1:A>
Exactly if he wants to laze around lah

<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#75:1:A>
I think he needs that roughly

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#76:1:C>
If you want to laze around three days is more than sufficient

<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#77:1:C>
Two full days of time one full day of night

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#78:1:A>
Of course the night life there is quite great

<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#79:1:A>
A lot of basically you can see the international people

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#80:1:B>
They have disco over there

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#81:1:A>
Ya it is at the Hard the Rock Hard not Hard Rock cafe

<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#82:1:A>
If you know what I mean

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#83:1:B>
They have those pasar malam there right just like in Pattaya

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#84:1:C>
Right

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#85:1:A>
It is all lined up along the road along the street

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#86:1:B>
Then it is very much like Pattaya I suppose

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#87:1:A>
Ya but more cosmopolitan in the sense that you have a
<unclear> word </unclear>

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#88:1:C>
What do you mean by cosmopolitan

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#89:1:A>
Well different type of different type of people there
different types of people mainly Caucasians

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#90:1:C>
<unclear> word </unclear>

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#91:1:B>
How much do you think we have we need to change

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#92:1:A>
Up to you if you are impulsive spender then you will have to
change more

<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#93:1:A>
But I think hundred Sing is sufficient

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#94:1:B>
For four days

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#95:1:A>
You have to bear in mind we have to pay airport tax over that
side

<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#96:1:A>
It is two hundred Baht if I am not mistaken unless they have revise
the charges

<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#97:1:A>
Any case oh ya if you want to go for the cabaret show <unclear>
word </unclear> it is two hundred and fifty Baht

<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#98:1:A>
So it is about uh twenty twenty dollars uh eighteen twenty dollars

<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#99:1:A>
The ratio Baht to Sing one to fifteen

<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#100:1:A>
One Sing to fifteen Baht

<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#101:1:A>
Last time I went ten years ago was one to eight

<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#102:1:A>
Now it is one to fifteen

<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#103:1:A>
So good

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#104:1:B>
One to fifteen uh

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#105:1:A>
One Singapore is equivalent to fifteen Baht

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#106:1:B>
So one Baht is about uh seven

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#107:1:A>
One divide by fifteen

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#108:1:B>
One hundred Baht seven seven Sing dollars

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#109:1:A>
One hundred Baht will be seven Sing dollars

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#110:1:B>
So when was the last time you went

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#111:1:C>

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#112:1:A>

<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#113:1:B>

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#118:1:C>
Ya

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#119:1:A>

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#120:1:B>
Quite close to Taiwanese Tai Pi

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#121:1:C>
Ninety dollars

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#122:1:B>
I think also

<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#123:1:B>
I don't think I will be spending much five hundred four hundred
and fifty Baht <unclear> word </unclear>

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#124:1:A>
How much do you intend to bring

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#125:1:C>
Hundred

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#126:1:B>
But why you bring one hundred

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#127:1:C>
I am cheap man

<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#128:1:C>
Cheaper better

<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#129:1:C>

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#130:1:A>
I am not going to buy anything much there because got there
enough already

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#131:1:B>
T shirts all these are in what

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#132:1:A>

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#133:1:C>
<unclear> word </unclear>

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#134:1:A>
Of course you can go the top take a tut tut or you want to
hire a train

<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#135:1:A>
Or you can spend the whole day at town or just

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#136:1:B>
Do they have durians there

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#137:1:A>
Oh yes

<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#138:1:A>
I don't know whether the season is on too

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#139:1:C>
Cashews nuts I heard

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#140:1:A>
Yeah Lay Boon view

<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#141:1:A>
We are passing by a Cashew nut factory

<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#142:1:A>
Hopefully that is the itinerary by our agency

<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#143:1:A>
We have not visited our agency at all you know

<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#144:1:A>
Don't know what is going on

<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#145:1:A>
So call blind lead blind

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#146:1:B>
How do you how do you come across this

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#147:1:A>
Pardon

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#148:1:B>
How did you get to know about this

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#149:1:A>
Your friendly newspaper man

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#150:1:B>
Oh

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#151:1:A>
Newspaper

<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#152:1:A>
Only two or three agencies having this promotion four days three
night right

<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#153:1:A>
But of course it is the accommodation that is the diff different

<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#154:1:A>
Four star and you know five

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#155:1:B>
Miles ahead programme

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#156:1:A>
Miles ahead programme

<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#157:1:A>
What is it about

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#158:1:B>
Every hundred dollars you charge to your your card uhVisa
card you will be given one travel point

<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#159:1:B>
So all you need is to just clear this travel point

<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#160:1:B>
The least is seven travel points

<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#161:1:B>
That gives you an whole list of discount you know

<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#162:1:B>
Uh the one that I am very interested is the one at do you
pronounce as Bifort or what

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#163:1:C>
Sentosa Bifort hotel

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#164:1:A>
So Beaufort hotel is it

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#165:1:B>
Ya for me seventy odd dollars hundred

<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#166:1:B>
Can't remember the actual but it was more than seventy per cent
discount

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#167:1:A>
Ah ha

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#168:1:B>
If you were to go the market you are paying something like
three hundred plus

<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#169:1:B>
But with thirty points first thing you pay hundred and seven
seventy odd

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#170:1:A>
So it is similar to the frequent fly programme on the airline

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#171:1:B>
uh

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#172:1:A>
But I thought you can exchange it for an air ticket

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#173:1:C>
But in the hotel I will make it <unclear> word </unclear>

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#174:1:A>
Fifty per cent

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#175:1:C>
Fifty per cent

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#176:1:A>
According to him is

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#177:1:C>
Seven

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#178:1:A>
Seventy per cent you know

<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#179:1:A>
It is a suite ah

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#180:1:B>
Ah a suite

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#181:1:C>
Good

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#182:1:B>
And the just look at they are going to advertise very
aggressively because this is this is a very good programme I think personally

<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#183:1:B>
You can also get the one of free return ticket to KLat seventy
seventy nine dollar or so at Qantas Airline with seven dollars pointers in it

<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#184:1:B>
Only for six months this programme

<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#185:1:B>
That is within this six months you must charge lah but you can
redeem the gift travel till till nineteen ninety four

<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#186:1:B>
Loy you should say something lah

<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#187:1:B>

Hello Mummy

<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#282:2:D>
You look very busy

<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#283:2:D>
What are you doing now

<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#284:2:D>
I mean it's so late already

<$E> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#285:2:E>
I'm marking

<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#286:2:E>
It is CA2 now

<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#287:2:E>
I'm in the midst of uh the marking exercise

<$D> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#288:2:D>
Is it finished yet

<$E> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#289:2:E>
Oh just completed

<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#290:2:E>
I've got uh twenty-four passes in Maths and I'm very very happy
over the results

<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#291:2:E>
Because my the majority in my class are Malay and uhm and uh
normally Malay children don't do well <X>

<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#X292:2:E>
And uh helping this lot of children for about eight months they
have improved

<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#X293:2:E>
I'm indeed very happy

<$D> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#X294:2:D>
I'm glad to hear that

<$E> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#X295:2:E>
But they did not do so well in English

<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#X296:2:E>
I'm rather disappointed

<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#X297:2:E>
I've only got sixteen passes in English and the passing mark is
uhm all borderline cases

<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#X298:2:E>
I need to work very hard in that

<$D> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#X299:2:D>
Considering that this year I know that you got uh 6B class

<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#X300:2:D>
I think is that is that not bad right

<$E> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#X301:2:E>
Uhm I've done

<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#X302:2:E>
I should think my conscience is clear

<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#X303:2:E>
I've done my very best

<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#X304:2:E>
I uhm have done a lot to help them in English especially

<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#X305:2:E>
They are extremely they were extremely weak in English when they
came to my class

<ICE-SIN:S1A-043#X306:2:E>
Now they have indeed improved </X> </I>
