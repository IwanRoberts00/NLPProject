Q: Write a critique on population planning in Singapore since 1959.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-003#2:1>
A Population planning has played a significant role in Singapore.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-003#3:1>
Since the 1960s to the present day, the government of Singapore has
used population planning very effectively to control the trends of population
growth in Singapore.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-003#4:1>
Basically, the trend of population growth since 1959 has been a
downward one. <X>

<ICE-SIN:W1A-003#X5:1>
Table 1: Rates of Natural Increase For 1958 to 1989.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-003#X6:1>
Sources: Cheng 1989;p.163.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-003#X7:1>
& The Straits Times, 17 Dec 1990. </X>

<ICE-SIN:W1A-003#8:1>
As seen from Table 1, the rate of natural increase has declined
steadily from 34.1 per thousand in 1958, to a low of 10.9 per thousand in
1983.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-003#9:1>
From 1985 to 1989, the rate fluctuated between 11.4 per thousand and
14.8 per thousand.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-003#10:1>
Though it has increased somewhat as compared to 1983, the present
rates are still very low as compared to 1958.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-003#11:1>
Thus we see that in the short span of approximately 25 years ( from
1958 to 1983), Singapore has managed to reduce its initially high growth
rates drastically.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-003#12:1>
The population planning in Singapore can be divided into two fairly
distinct periods ( refer to Chart 1 below); firstly, there was the pre-1987
period, where the main thrust of the programme was to encourage women to "
stop at two" ( Cheng 1989;p.165).

<ICE-SIN:W1A-003#13:1>
The post-1987 period was a complete " turnabout" ( Cheng 1989;p.172)
from the previous population policy.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-003#14:1>
This period " aimed at selective procreation" ( Cheng 1989;p.172)
based on affordability.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-003#15:1>
I will now deal with each period separately. <X>

<ICE-SIN:W1A-003#X16:1>
Chart 1: The Population Planning Policies introduced in Singapore
since 1947.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-003#X17:1>
Adapted from Cheng 1989;p 165 </X>

<ICE-SIN:W1A-003#18:1>
As was seen from Table 1, the rate of natural increase in 1958 was
very high at 34.1 per thousand.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-003#19:1>
The crude birth rate was 39.4 per thousand in 1959 ( Cheung
1989;p.35, Tab.5.5).

<ICE-SIN:W1A-003#20:1>
The high growth rates then, meant that if population growth was not
halted, the numbers would have been too numerous for a small island like
Singapore.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-003#21:1>
In fact, projections have indicated that with the " big family norm"
in the 1960s, Singapore's population would have hit five million in the year
2000 if the growth was not curbed ( The Straits Times 2 March, 1987).

<ICE-SIN:W1A-003#22:1>
Being a small island, Singapore could not risk having a large
population which it would not be able to support.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-003#23:1>
The rationale was that if the population was too large, it would lead
to problems like mass poverty, which could have left a young, and thus
vulnerable country like Singapore the, impoverished.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-003#24:1>
As it was in the late 1950s and early 1960s, high unemployment, poor
health care and educational facilities made things look quite dismal.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-003#25:1>
The earliest attempt at population planning was in 1947 when the
Family Planning Association was formed.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-003#26:1>
Between 1949 and 1968, there were " 87,921 new acceptors" ( Cheng
1989;p.166) as a result of the Association's efforts.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-003#27:1>
Though the number of acceptors was not very great, the Association
helped by " creating an awareness among the people towards accepting family
planning" ( Cheng 1989;p.166).

<ICE-SIN:W1A-003#28:1>
From 1966 to 1985, under the Singapore Family Planning and Population
Board ( SFPPB), which was established in 1966, there were 387,702 new
acceptors.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-003#29:1>
After 1969, due to the " saturation effect" ( Cheng 1989;p.166) of
new acceptors, the Gross Reproduction Rate ( GRR), which fell from 2.187 to
1.568 in the period 1966 to 1969, " showed signs of levelling off" ( Cheng
1989;p.166).

<ICE-SIN:W1A-003#30:1>
Therefore, in 1970, the government enforced the " legislation of
induced abortion and voluntary sterilisation" ( Cheng 1989;p.166).

<ICE-SIN:W1A-003#31:1>
The GRR was thus further reduced.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-003#32:1>
The " stop-at-two" policy with its many incentives and disincentives
was introduced in 1972.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-003#33:1>
Some of the incentives and disincentives included " no-pay maternity
leave after the second child, income tax relief up to the third child only,
higher accouchement fees for the fourth and subsequent child, lower priority
for admission to primary school, and no permission for families with more
than three children to sublet their flats." ( Cheng 1989;p.166), also helped
bring down the GRR, as the number of abortions increased year after year.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-003#34:1>
A combination of the above policies, resulted in the substantial
slowing down of the rapid population growth.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-003#35:1>
An important question to consider however, is how great was the part
that population planning played?

<ICE-SIN:W1A-003#36:1>
Were there other factors that caused the GRR to decline as well?

<ICE-SIN:W1A-003#37:1>
The answer to the questions above, is that though population planning
was one very important factor, there have been several other factors that
have also helped in curbing the rapid population growth.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-003#38:1>
The most important factor after population planning, was that of
rapid socio-economic development.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-003#39:1>
Improvement in education, especially that of females has led to "
higher female participation in the labour force" and " greater female
economic independence" ( Cheng 1989;p.167).

<ICE-SIN:W1A-003#40:1>
This has in turn resulted in late marriages, delayed child-bearing,
the desire for fewer children, and even resulted in some women remaining
single.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-003#41:1>
Urbanization, and improvement in the levels of income and standards
of living as a result of it, have also caused expectations to rise.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-003#42:1>
People thus prefer to have less children so that they can provide
their children with more luxuries.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-003#43:1>
Instead of quantity, quality became the important consideration.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-003#44:1>
The value of children hence had changed from the traditional ideas of
children as assets, to that of children as liabilities.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-003#45:1>
One important implication of the anti-natalist policy in the 1960s to
the early 1980s, was the fact that coupled with the socio-economic
development, it had caused the population growth rate to recede too rapidly.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-003#46:1>
There was therefore danger of a maturing work force, a higher
dependency ratio, and eventually, ageing of the population.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-003#47:1>
The " Great Marriage Debate" ( see Chart 1 on page 2) was sparked off
in 1983 by the former Prime Minister of Singapore, Lee Kuan Yew.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-003#48:1>
He brought it up as he had noticed that the graduates who marry
another graduate tend to have less children or no children at all.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-003#49:1>
The gist of it was that the better-educated should be encouraged to
have more children, in view of their having less babies ( see Table 2), as
what Singapore needs is not only more babies, but also more intelligent
babies.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-003#50:1>
Table 2: Married Females by Highest Qualification and number of
children born alive, 1980.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-003#51:1>
Source: Cheng 1989;p.169.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-003#52:1>
This was assuming that intelligent parents would produce intelligent
babies.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-003#53:1>
A more important problem that was noticed was the trend of unmarried
females with a tertiary or upper secondary education.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-003#54:1>
According to Appendix I, it was estimated that only 5% of males with
a tertiary education are single, for the females, as many as 41% are single.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-003#55:1>
In contrast, the number of single males in the category " no
qualifications", was 38%, whereas for females in this category, the
percentage was only a mere 3%.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-003#56:1>
The problem could be attributed to the traditional practise for men
to 'marry down'.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-003#57:1>
The reasons for the introduction of the " selective pro-natalist
policy" are hence more complicated than for the previous policy.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-003#58:1>
The " Great Marriage Debate" resulted in much controversy and so, "
better-educated" was changed to " those who can afford it".

<ICE-SIN:W1A-003#59:1>
This was on the rationale that usually, the better-educated would be
among those who could afford having three or more children; and that even if
the parents were not very well-educated, as long as they were well-off, they
would likewise understand the importance of a tertiary education and be able
to support their children through it.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-003#60:1>
In 1986, the slogan " At least two.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-003#61:1>
Better three.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-003#62:1>
Four if you can afford it" ( Cheng 1989;p.171) was introduced.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-003#63:1>
The SFPPB was also done away with, and a Population Planning Unit was
formed " to promote fertility" ( Cheng 1989;p.171) in the same year.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-003#64:1>
Previously strict immigration and citizenship laws, were also relaxed
to allow selective immigration of professionals and entrepreneurs, so as to
increase the " talent pool" ( Cheng 1989;p.171).

<ICE-SIN:W1A-003#65:1>
With the " three-child family" ( Chart 1, p.2) policy, incentives and
disincentives were also introduced.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-003#66:1>
Some of them, included a
&dollar;10,000 sterilization incentive to discourage poorer people from having more
than one or two children; a
&dollar;20,000 tax rebate; government subsidies " for the use of child-care
centres"; priority in school registration for three-child families, and also
for bigger HDB ( Housing Development Board) flats after the birth of the
third child.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-003#67:1>
There was also the formation of the Social Development Unit ( SDU) in
an effort to create opportunities for graduates to interact.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-003#68:1>
A similar unit, the Social Development Section ( SDS) was set up "
for secondary school leavers with certain qualifications" ( Cheng
1989;p.170).

<ICE-SIN:W1A-003#69:1>
One result of the above policies, was that higher educated women
began to have more children.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-003#70:1>
According to the Business Times ( 17 March, 1989), in 1989, the group
of women had 7% more babies than in 1988.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-003#71:1>
More graduate men also took brides of equal qualifications ( The
Straits Times 28 July, 1991).

<ICE-SIN:W1A-003#72:1>
As seen in Table 1 above, the rate of natural growth had increased
from a low of 10.9 per thousand in 1983 to 14.8 in 1988 and back to 12.5 in
1989.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-003#73:1>
For the three main ethnic groups in Singapore, there are differences
too. <X>

<ICE-SIN:W1A-003#X74:1>
Table 3: Total Fertility Rates by ethnic groups, 1960 to 1986.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-003#X75:1>
Source: Cheung 1989;p.37 </X>

<ICE-SIN:W1A-003#76:1>
In Table 3, we see that the Total Fertility Rate ( TFR) for the
Indians have gone down from 7.37 in 1960 to 1.89 in 1986;

<ICE-SIN:W1A-003#77:1>
for the Malays, it was 6.42 in 1960 as compared to 2.05 in 1986; the
Chinese had the lowest rate of the three for 1960 when it was 5.62, and once
again in 1986 when it was 1.26.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-003#78:1>
As the Chinese make up the majority of Singapore's population,
changes in their trends would affect the rates for the nation as a whole.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-003#79:1>
Hence, the TFR for the total population was 5.77 in 1960 and 1.44 in
1986 ( see Table 4).

<ICE-SIN:W1A-003#80:1>
Therefore, in 1988, the increase in the rate of natural increase, may
have been a result of the fact that that was the dragon year on the Chinese
calendar.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-003#81:1>
The TFR for that year was 1.98.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-003#82:1>
This is contrasted with 1986 which was considered the inauspicious
year of the ferocious white tiger.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-003#83:1>
The TFR then was 1.44.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-003#84:1>
Hence, the increase for the years after the " three-child" policy may
have been attributed more to the result of this belief in the Chinese zodiac,
than a result of the success of the policy. <X>

<ICE-SIN:W1A-003#X85:1>
Table 4: The Total fertility Rate, 1960 to 1990. Source: Cheung
1989;p.37. </X>

<ICE-SIN:W1A-003#86:1>
Another point that supports this , is that habits are hard to change,
and the desire for social mobility is especially great in the competitive
atmosphere of Singapore.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-003#87:1>
It may thus take longer to increase growth rates as this is going
against the natural desire of man.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-003#88:1>
The population policy has of course had some degree of success, but
the results do not seem as striking as in the period of the anti-natalist
policy.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-003#89:1>
We therefore see in the success of the pre-1986 period, that
population planning was but one of two main factors that resulted in the
reduction of the growth rates.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-003#90:1>
In contrast, the success of the post-1987 period ( which has yet to
end), will have to depend more, on how fervently the government can promote
the " three-child" policy. </I>

<ICE-SIN:W1A-003#91:2>
Question: Explain the factors accounting for the differential ethnic
population growth in Peninsular Malaysia since independence.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-003#92:2>
The population growth rates of the three principle races -- the
Malays, Chinese and Indians -- in Peninsular Malaysia are very different as
a result of the numerous factors affecting each one of them.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-003#93:2>
Generally, the population growth since independence in 1957 has
declined steadily.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-003#94:2>
When we say population growth, we normally refer to the components of
mortality, fertility and migration.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-003#95:2>
However, since independence, the effect of migration on the
population was almost negligible.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-003#96:2>
The population growth of Peninsular Malaysia after 1957 thus " began
to depend largely on natural increase" ( Saw, 1988;p.55).

<ICE-SIN:W1A-003#97:2>
There are two things to consider when looking at natural increase;
the mortality and the fertility rates.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-003#98:2>
The factors which affect mortality and fertility are different for
the different ethnic groups and they are what we shall focus on when
explaining the factors which account for the differential ethnic population
growth since 1957.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-003#99:2>
In this essay, we shall first look at the overall population growth
for each of the ethnic groups.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-003#100:2>
Then, we will proceed to the factors affecting the differential
ethnic population growth.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-003#101:2>
As mentioned above, the population growth after 1957 generally
declined.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-003#102:2>
This is true of almost all three ethnic groups.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-003#103:2>
There are however some fluctuations. <X>

<ICE-SIN:W1A-003#X104:2>
As seen in Table 1, the Malay annual growth rate increased from
2.6% in 1957 to 3.1% in 1970 but fell again in 1984 to 3.0%.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-003#X105:2>
The Chinese experienced a slight increase from 2.2% in 1957 to 2.3%
in 1970.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-003#X106:2>
It fell again to 2.0% in 1984.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-003#X107:2>
The Indians did not experience any increase at all and their annual
growth rate fell steadily from 2.7% in 1957 to 2.2% in 1984.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-003#X108:2>
For the two latter ethnic groups, their growth rates showed a drop
from the 1957 rates to the 1984 rates.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-003#X109:2>
For the Malays however, there is a slight increase, which according
to Saw was due to the some new Malay immigrants from the neighbouring
countries ( 1988;p.56. Table 1 Annual Growth Rates for Three Main Races Year
1957 1970 1980 1984 Percentage ( %) Malays 2.6 3.1 3.0 3.0 Chinese 2.2 2.3
2.1 2.0 Indians 2.7 2.3 2.3 2.3 Source: Saw ( 1988), p.54. </X>

<ICE-SIN:W1A-003#110:2>
Mortality in Peninsular Malaysia has declined quite rapidly since
pre-independence years, from a crude death rate ( CDR) of 22.0 in 1934-36 to
11.7 in 1955-57 ( Saw, 1988;p.122).

<ICE-SIN:W1A-003#111:2>
The CDR continued to decline after independence from 15.8 in 1950 to
5.6 in 1984 ( Tan, 1987;p.6).

<ICE-SIN:W1A-003#112:2>
Generally, the decline in the mortality of the population was due to
the improvement of health facilities, medical care and hygiene standards.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-003#113:2>
There was a shift of focus from the urban areas to rural areas and
estates as well.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-003#114:2>
Other factors such as increased literacy, etc.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-003#115:2>
also contributed greatly to bringing the mortality down.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-003#116:2>
Among the three races, there were interesting differences to note.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-003#117:2>
With reference to Table 2, the CDR for the Chinese declined from
12.7 in 1950 steadily to 5.5 in 1984, the difference being 7.2.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-003#118:2>
For the Indians, there was a decline too, though for them, it was
slightly less than for the Chinese.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-003#119:2>
The reason for this was that during this period, there were still
Indians being employed on the estates.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-003#120:2>
Since the medical care of the estates came under the companies to
which the estates belonged, it was commonly neglected.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-003#121:2>
As such, it accounted for the slightly smaller difference ( it was a
difference of 6.3) in the CDR of the period 1950 to 1984.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-003#122:2>
The Malays experienced the greatest decline in their CDR, from 18.7
in 1950 to 5.3 in 1984, with a difference of 13.4.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-003#123:2>
The reasons for this are twofold.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-003#124:2>
Firstly, the Malays had a higher mortality at the beginning of the
period, their decline was therefore substantially more.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-003#125:2>
This is contrasted to the Chinese whose mortality rates have always
been relatively lower.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-003#126:2>
Secondly, the Malays were also greatly affected by the "
Government's effort to raise their living standard under the new Economic
Policy" ( Tan, 1987;p.9).

<ICE-SIN:W1A-003#127:2>
With the implementation of the policy, the government hoped to
improve the Malays' standard of living and quality of life, so that they
would be better equipped to compete with the other two races.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-003#128:2>
One of the effects of the policy was thus the lowering of the CDR .

<ICE-SIN:W1A-003#130:2>
The same information is also gathered from the computation of the
standardised death rates which provide more accuracy as to the mortality
trends of the three ethnic groups.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-003#131:2>
According to Saw, the reduction of mortality for the Malays was
75.9% during 1916-81; as compared to 61.4% and 56.1% for the Chinese and
Indians respectively, during the same period ( 1988;p.131).

<ICE-SIN:W1A-003#132:2>
Another index that is more accurate than the CDR is the infant
mortality rate.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-003#133:2>
The reason for this lies in the fact that a great portion of the
total mortality rates in the past was the result of infant mortality which
was high.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-003#134:2>
According to Saw, the infant mortality rates of all the three races
declined.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-003#135:2>
In 1946-48, the infant mortality rates of the Chinese was 44% lower
than the Malays ( Saw,1988;p.137).

<ICE-SIN:W1A-003#136:2>
The infant mortality rates of the Indians were also lower than that
of the Malays, by 22% ( Saw,1988;p.137).

<ICE-SIN:W1A-003#137:2>
However, in recent years, such as the period 1979-81, the infant
mortality rates of all the three races are pretty low, with the lowest being
the Chinese at 16.9, followed by the Malays at 27.0 and finally the Indians
at 27.7 ( Saw, 1988;p.136).

<ICE-SIN:W1A-003#138:2>
The infant mortality rates of the Chinese has always been relatively
lower.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-003#139:2>
This is even true of the pre-independence years as many of the
Chinese population live in the urban or suburban areas and relatively more of
the them are educated as a result.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-003#140:2>
The Malays on the other hand reside predominantly in the rural
areas, where medical care, sanitation, hygiene and other basic services were
not well developed at that time.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-003#141:2>
These, in addition to the poor nutrition and the lack of education
resulted in a high infant immortality rate.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-003#142:2>
Things have changed now and this is reflected in the low rate of
infant mortality among the Malays.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-003#143:2>
General fertility trends have declined as well since independence.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-003#144:2>
After the second world war, the crude birth rates have declined with
few exceptions.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-003#145:2>
In fact, after independence from 1957 to 1987, the CBR declined by
16.7, the overall decline being from 46.2 in 1957 to 29.5 in 1987 ( refer to
lecture handout).

<ICE-SIN:W1A-003#146:2>
The birth rates of the different races have also experienced a
decline, even though there are great differences in the pattern for each of
the different races.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-003#147:2>
This will be further discussed when we refer to the Gross
Reproduction Rate ( GRR) of the different ethnic groups later on.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-003#148:2>
The GRR for the three races display slight though not great
fluctuations.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-003#149:2>
The fluctuations experienced are mainly the result of the Malays.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-003#150:2>
The difference of the GRR for the Malays between 1957 and 1983 went
down by only 0.760 as seen in the table below.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-003#151:2>
For the other two races, the trend is generally declining as shown
in Table 3.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-003#152:2>
For the period 1917-57, the percentage annual change increased for
the Indians and the Malays, while the Chinese experienced a 0.4% decline (
Saw, 1988;p.191).

<ICE-SIN:W1A-003#153:2>
In 1958 however, there was a decline for all the ethnic groups.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-003#154:2>
Generally from 1957-83, the fertility of the Malays decreased only
by 25.7%, while the Chinese and the Indians had far greater reductions
resulting in the fertility being reduced by 62.3% and 61.1% respectively (
Saw, 1988;p.192). <X>

<ICE-SIN:W1A-003#157:2>
Now, we move on to the factors accounting for these differences
among the races.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-003#158:2>
Factors that explained the lower reduction of fertility for the
Malays are firstly, that being basically rural, the postponement of
childbearing to the later years brought about by family planning, is not
coupled with having less children.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-003#159:2>
The tightening of rules regarding divorce for the Malays who are
mostly Muslims is another factor.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-003#160:2>
Divorce used to be very easy for the Muslims and this would mean
that the couple do not stay together long enough to have many children.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-003#161:2>
Stricter rules hence would mean that now, the couple stay together
for a longer time which may lead to an increase in birth rates.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-003#162:2>
Finally, only 4.1% of Malay women aged 25-34 were using
contraceptives in 1966-67 ( Saw, 1988;p.192).

<ICE-SIN:W1A-003#163:2>
This would then, definitely lead to a higher fertility rate among
Malays as a result of no proper practice of family planning.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-003#164:2>
The Chinese on the other hand experienced an earlier decline in
fertility.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-003#165:2>
This, in itself made the decline from 1957 onwards more rapid.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-003#166:2>
The Chinese started practising contraception way before the family
planning programme was implemented in 1966-67.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-003#167:2>
The fact that the minimum age for marriage of Chinese women had
risen to 22.05 years in 1957 was another important consideration, as it was
almost four years higher than that of the Malay or Indian women ( Saw,
1988;p.200).

<ICE-SIN:W1A-003#168:2>
Four years, could mean another one to three babies.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-003#169:2>
The Indians' almost equally rapidly declining fertility rate was
attributed to the special family planning services provided in the estates.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-003#170:2>
It is also important to notice that though the Indians' fertility
rates are slightly higher than the Chinese, their decline in GRR from 1957 to
1983 was the greatest among the three races, at 2.301 ( refer to Table 3,
p.5.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-003#171:2>
above).

<ICE-SIN:W1A-003#172:2>
This could be attributed to the fact that the GRR for the Indians,
for the year 1957, was very much greater than for the Chinese.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-003#173:2>
The decline is therefore more.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-003#174:2>
Besides, the younger age at marriage for the females and the higher
proportion of married women as compared to the Chinese, also explain the
slightly higher fertility rates.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-003#175:2>
The above factors brought up for supporting and explaining the
differential ethnic population growth are by no means exhaustive, the list
goes on.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-003#176:2>
However, here, due to several constraints, I have just brought up a
few of the more major and interesting factors. <X>
