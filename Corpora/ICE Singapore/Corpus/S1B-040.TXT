<ICE-SIN:S1B-040#1:1:A>
Welcome to the programme Mister David Marshall

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-040#2:1:B>
Thank you

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-040#3:1:A>
May I sort of begin our conversation by drawing on one of the
uhm the comments that you made in the short video clip uh just at that before
it concluded

<ICE-SIN:S1B-040#4:1:A>
Have the years indeed mellowed you

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-040#5:1:B>
Well the fire in the belly is embers now but it can always be
fan to flame by injustice

<ICE-SIN:S1B-040#6:1:B>
I have a deep emotional desire for human justice

<ICE-SIN:S1B-040#7:1:B>
Uh a deep feeling for respect for my fellow human beings

<ICE-SIN:S1B-040#8:1:B>
That has not altered

<ICE-SIN:S1B-040#9:1:B>
My capacity to seek to develop these ideas into a practical
improvement of conditions of course is very much less and with age a few
windows closed

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-040#10:1:A>
You have held some very strong views of what you feel
Singapore and Singaporean should be and the if I may uh take the liberty of
quoting an interview from an interview you had in nineteen eighty-eight

<ICE-SIN:S1B-040#11:1:A>
Uhm you said and if I may quote you Mister Marshall we have not
come of age

<ICE-SIN:S1B-040#12:1:A>
We are adolescents

<ICE-SIN:S1B-040#13:1:A>
We have ability but no grace

<ICE-SIN:S1B-040#14:1:A>
We exaggerate our importance and forget that we are no more than a
pinpoint on the globe

<ICE-SIN:S1B-040#15:1:A>
We have a long way to go and I heard that we go that road in
humility

<ICE-SIN:S1B-040#16:1:A>
I think these are sentiments <unclear> word </unclear>

<ICE-SIN:S1B-040#17:1:A>
What drove you to express those opinions in nineteen eighty-eight

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-040#18:1:B>
Well the the realities of the situation then

<ICE-SIN:S1B-040#19:1:B>
I was seeking to tell our people look this is how it is today but
because there are defects this is how it can be improved

<ICE-SIN:S1B-040#20:1:B>
Whether I was right or wrong is irrelevant

<ICE-SIN:S1B-040#21:1:B>
I was honest about it

<ICE-SIN:S1B-040#22:1:B>
And let's be fair in the last eight years I think we've taken a
giant step

<ICE-SIN:S1B-040#23:1:B>
I was until Thursday I was Dean of the Commonwealth Ambassadors in
Paris and there were every month we had lunch and I meet about twenty-three
twenty-four ambassadors most of them from the third world and the respect for
Singapore was a joy a real joy

<ICE-SIN:S1B-040#24:1:B>
So we're no longer an uh irrelevant pinpoint

<ICE-SIN:S1B-040#25:1:B>
We are a very relevant a global city

<ICE-SIN:S1B-040#26:1:B>
That's a long way to go As for graciousness in my embassy I get
officers constantly changing

<ICE-SIN:S1B-040#27:1:B>
And my impression is that the officers who have come to Paris
recently are far more sophisticated with a a growing sense of the
graciousness of living Uh my minister Wong Kan Seng gave me a dinner to
farewell me

<ICE-SIN:S1B-040#28:1:B>
He and his Misses Wong Brigadier-General Yeo and his wife heads of
government depart all the departments of the foreign office and a beautiful
silver <unclear> word </unclear> to farewell me ten years ago eight years ago

<ICE-SIN:S1B-040#29:1:B>
That would not have happened spending public money on a function
that produced no money

<ICE-SIN:S1B-040#30:1:B>
But he understood the meaning uh and the worth the worthwhileness
of a gracious act

<ICE-SIN:S1B-040#31:1:B>
That's important

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-040#32:1:A>
Yes yes

<ICE-SIN:S1B-040#33:1:A>
But but sorry for interrupting but would this be applicable
generally to all Singaporeans I mean we still see a lot of grabbing out

<ICE-SIN:S1B-040#34:1:A>
We still see many manifestations of self-interest and surely that
is that goes against the uh the the perception of gracious to be honest

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-040#35:1:B>
Uh not self-interest

<ICE-SIN:S1B-040#36:1:B>
Self-interest is part of human nature

<ICE-SIN:S1B-040#37:1:B>
You know Mao Zi Tong tried to change it and failed

<ICE-SIN:S1B-040#38:1:B>
No no no let let's get our picture right

<ICE-SIN:S1B-040#39:1:B>
Yes we are the new ridge okay

<ICE-SIN:S1B-040#40:1:B>
Uh yes we haven't got the sophistication fully yet

<ICE-SIN:S1B-040#41:1:B>
But we are getting there

<ICE-SIN:S1B-040#42:1:B>
Our people are a very decent people and a very reasonable people
and frankly I'm delighted to be born in Singapore

<ICE-SIN:S1B-040#43:1:B>
I like them they've been wonderful to me

<ICE-SIN:S1B-040#44:1:B>
So when you talk of graciousness yes there's a lot of uh scrabbling
for money

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-040#45:1:A>
Yes

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-040#46:1:B>
It's it's a I think it's the fault of the government

<ICE-SIN:S1B-040#47:1:B>
They keep insisting on merit and and and uh uhm merit is uh
expressed in uh the medals in my chest and the money in my bank account

<ICE-SIN:S1B-040#48:1:B>
But uh let's be fair again you know

<ICE-SIN:S1B-040#49:1:B>
The other night Community Chest Centre I had Goh Chok Tong speak of
compassion and solidarity

<ICE-SIN:S1B-040#50:1:B>
We're coming along I mean George Yeo last week was it uh he put
forward uh uh a very heroic plan for uh development for cultural activity of
our people

<ICE-SIN:S1B-040#51:1:B>
So I see these glimmers uh of our understanding that now we have
filled the rice bowl we must move on to the quality of living beyond our
physical needs

<ICE-SIN:S1B-040#52:1:B>
And frankly as I see our people they enjoy they like they
appreciate and they accept uh tendencies to greater respect for the human
individual for the graces of living for the grace of human relations

<ICE-SIN:S1B-040#53:1:B>
I'm I'm I'm not uh I'm not pessimistic I'm much more optimistic
today than I was eight years ago

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-040#54:1:A>
Wouldn't there be any pitfalls that we have got to be worried
about

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-040#55:1:B>
There are two challenges

<ICE-SIN:S1B-040#56:1:B>
One is racial harmony and look I I'm a critic of the P A P but in
fairness they have done a wonderful job of softening antagonisms of fair play
for all communities and so long as this tradition lasts of respect for
minority groups and there is respect for minor then we're alright

<ICE-SIN:S1B-040#57:1:B>
There is an emphasis too great an emphasis but then maybe I'm
unSingaporean in this on money values For me you know I say after eighty-five
years of living I believe that human relations are far far more satisfying
than the money in my bank and the medals on my chest and there I have them

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-040#58:1:A>
Yes

<ICE-SIN:S1B-040#59:1:A>
I'm afraid we got to go for a short break now Mister Marshall but
before we go I will just like to uh leave you with a thought that in view of
the present stage of development of Singapore we are subject to more open
influences and one of those uh influences that are now prevade that is now
prevading the world is this question of human rights and human freedom
individual freedom

<ICE-SIN:S1B-040#60:1:A>
But uh we'll take a break now and we'll come back and take up this
question

<ICE-SIN:S1B-040#61:1:A>
Don't go away now we'll be back to discuss and continue with this
conversation

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-040#62:1:B>
That's a global question

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-040#63:1:A>
Welcome back

<ICE-SIN:S1B-040#64:1:A>
Before we took the break Mister Marshall I raised the point of
human rights and personal freedom

<ICE-SIN:S1B-040#65:1:A>
I think this is a point which confronts a lot of those of us in
Singapore when we read about the sort of <unclear> word </unclear> that go on
internationally but what exactly how do you see this question of human rights

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-040#66:1:B>
That's a global question affects more than Singapore

<ICE-SIN:S1B-040#67:1:B>
As I see it historically the Asian approach is founded on Confucian
thought mainly

<ICE-SIN:S1B-040#68:1:B>
Two thousand five hundred years ago Confucius had such giant task
of trying to bring order to a chaos across the vast country

<ICE-SIN:S1B-040#69:1:B>
So he evolved a philosophy which is quite essential for the time to
bring order is a philosophy of primacy of the community's welfare

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-040#70:1:A>
Yes

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-040#71:1:B>
respect for authority

<ICE-SIN:S1B-040#72:1:B>
Legitimate though it was for the time and place it has led to
imperial repression

<ICE-SIN:S1B-040#73:1:B>
It has led to communist repression

<ICE-SIN:S1B-040#74:1:B>
It is the father of dictatorships because of course who is the
judge of the community's welfare except our bosses and they love the idea
respect authority and uh if they don't have opposition as because as these
majesty uh they they they lose a sight of the real individual's welfare and
it therefore emphasis on community's interest exclusively is unhealthy at
least to dictatorship and authoritarian rule

<ICE-SIN:S1B-040#75:1:B>
On the other side of the world the Western nations were leaven by
the Pseudo Christian concept of respect for the individual

<ICE-SIN:S1B-040#76:1:B>
And from the concept of respect for the individual flowed democracy
and democracy gave freedom to grow to his full height

<ICE-SIN:S1B-040#77:1:B>
And what a magnificent achievement Compare the result of the two
culture

<ICE-SIN:S1B-040#78:1:B>
But let's face it excess of individualism has meant fragmentation

<ICE-SIN:S1B-040#79:1:B>
It has meant uh egoism run <unclear> word </unclear> riot

<ICE-SIN:S1B-040#80:1:B>
Uh it has meant uh uh quite unpleasant results in many parts
especially in the United States which are so high so openly advertised

<ICE-SIN:S1B-040#81:1:B>
I see the picture as one where we must marry the two concepts There
must be both respect for community welfare as a framework and respect for the
individual and perhaps more respect for the individual than emphasis on the
community's welfare

<ICE-SIN:S1B-040#82:1:B>
And frankly I I I I see this government rather uh

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-040#83:1:A>
You think it's coming together here

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-040#84:1:B>
There is an attempt in Singapore it's slow-moving uh it's
hesitant but there's a slow-moving away from excessive community emphasis on
community welfare to movement to respect for the individual

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-040#85:1:A>
Yes

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-040#86:1:B>
I'd like to live longer enough to see the result of this
experiment maybe we can show the world how to do it

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-040#87:1:A>
You feel that all the necessary ingredients are in fact in
place

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-040#88:1:B>
We have an intelligent government

<ICE-SIN:S1B-040#89:1:B>
We have reasonably perceptive government even if they sometime seem
repressive and authoritarian they're not stupid

<ICE-SIN:S1B-040#90:1:B>
Uh they know what we're about and uh frankly it's more than a
question of vote getting

<ICE-SIN:S1B-040#91:1:B>
I believe they're totally sincere in seeking our welfare

<ICE-SIN:S1B-040#92:1:B>
I mean they're integrity shows it and uh yes I think that the
ingredient are here

<ICE-SIN:S1B-040#93:1:B>
The evolution may be slow but maybe a cautious approach is a wise
one of quiet evolution

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-040#94:1:A>
Yes yes of course one is evidently influenced by the accesses
one could see in other societies where this thing has gone a little out of
hand

<ICE-SIN:S1B-040#95:1:A>
But perhaps we can uh uh sort of uh uh come down to the next level
or so to speak of of of uh individual freedom which is of course uhm another
difficult uh area to touch on

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-040#96:1:B>
Mister Iau when my friends speak about that I say tell me
where are we lacking in freedom

<ICE-SIN:S1B-040#97:1:B>
What freedom are we lacking in

<ICE-SIN:S1B-040#98:1:B>
Wow they say have you become P A P

<ICE-SIN:S1B-040#99:1:B>
I said look I'm not pro P A P

<ICE-SIN:S1B-040#100:1:B>
I seek to have a sense of balance an honest balance

<ICE-SIN:S1B-040#101:1:B>
Look every time I come back to Singapore I feel like rig and
wrinkle asleep for decades and suddenly I say is this Colossal City my
Singapore

<ICE-SIN:S1B-040#102:1:B>
Are these vibrant dynamic people with vision and courage my fellow
citizens

<ICE-SIN:S1B-040#103:1:B>
How is this happen here in forty years You know why do we have to
emphasis the pimples on our face instead of looking and praising the
magnificent rippling muscles of our Olympic athlete's body

<ICE-SIN:S1B-040#104:1:B>
You know I won't to refuse to kiss a beautiful woman if she has a
pimple on her face

<ICE-SIN:S1B-040#105:1:B>
If I can have a government that is honest and they are honest

<ICE-SIN:S1B-040#106:1:B>
If I can have a government that's able Look around you even Benjay
Ratnam will have to confess they are able

<ICE-SIN:S1B-040#107:1:B>
If I can have a government that's caring and I think it's moving
that way beyond the caring for the general welfare and uh rice bowl caring
for the human individual and his own weaknesses well I'm a very lucky man

<ICE-SIN:S1B-040#108:1:B>
Look I'm not perfect

<ICE-SIN:S1B-040#109:1:B>
I mean I've got sort of applying for a halo why should I expect my
ministers to be perfect

<ICE-SIN:S1B-040#110:1:B>
Sure they make silly blunders

<ICE-SIN:S1B-040#111:1:B>
I mean for for me that's business about chewing gum honestly that
embarrassed me acutely

<ICE-SIN:S1B-040#112:1:B>
How could they

<ICE-SIN:S1B-040#113:1:B>
How could these very able people discern to such an absurdity

<ICE-SIN:S1B-040#114:1:B>
How could you use a forty pound hammer to crack a walnut

<ICE-SIN:S1B-040#115:1:B>
Uh okay so they make mistakes they make uh blunders

<ICE-SIN:S1B-040#116:1:B>
But what is the overall picture like

<ICE-SIN:S1B-040#117:1:B>
The overall picture makes me proud to be a Singapore

<ICE-SIN:S1B-040#118:1:B>
Unfortunately the publicity is all on our the pimples on our face
and I would frankly uh to have a session with our university students who
complain in the dark you know uh ruthless uh whatever

<ICE-SIN:S1B-040#119:1:B>
Okay tell me where do we lack in freedom

<ICE-SIN:S1B-040#120:1:B>
We've got a declaration of human rights by by by the United
Nations

<ICE-SIN:S1B-040#121:1:B>
Which paragraph have we transgressed

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-040#122:1:A>
Have we violated

<ICE-SIN:S1B-040#123:1:A>
Yes <X>

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-040#X124:1:B>
Let's have it openly Don't be afraid for heaven sake what
are you afraid of If you're honest what are you afraid of Has any honest man
gone to jail </X> </I>
