<h> Background </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-002#4:1>
The proliferation of short and long courses in management studies has
not only made difficult the choice of a right course by students, but also
the task of distinguishing a unique course by administrators and teachers.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-002#5:1>
In the flood of courses with overlapping curricula and syllabuses, one
would be hard put to find anything new, and yet relevant, among the safe and
well trodden areas of basic and general principles and practices.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-002#6:1>
It is time for courses to introduce controversial issues in management
studies.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-002#7:1>
A controversial issue covers new grounds.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-002#8:1>
It enhances the learning process.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-002#9:1>
It could facilitate further the practice of examining, analyzing and
deciding skills.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-002#10:1>
However, if not carefully introduced, controversial issues could
generate a disproportionate degree of confusion, and result in demotivating
the students.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-002#11:1>
As such, the introduction of a controversial issue in the curriculum
would have to be properly managed because a controversial issue could be
either a good or bad teacher by affecting learning through its contents or
through its dynamics.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-002#12:1>
<h> Aims </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-002#13:1>
The first part of this paper is to identify a controversial issue and
explain why it is controversial.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-002#14:1>
The second part of this paper is to relate a plan of action and show
how the introduction of a controversial issue should be implemented.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-002#15:1>
A case is used to illustrate the process of introducing a
controversial issue into the curriculum.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-002#16:1>
<h> Definition </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-002#17:1>
The term curriculum has ranges of meanings.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-002#18:1>
It is therefore necessary at the outset of this paper to define the
scope of this term used in this discussion.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-002#19:1>
This is to prevent the discussion from being distracted and confused
by the various interpretations of this term.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-002#20:1>
Similarly, what controversy is, in itself, controversial.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-002#21:1>
It is therefore important also at this outset, to have a workable
definition of the term 'controversial', in order to be able to evaluate and
qualify a proposed issue to be considered as a controversial issue for
discussion.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-002#22:1>
<h> Curriculum </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-002#23:1>
Broadly, curriculum could mean the overall education programme of an
institution and it embraces individual subject areas.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-002#24:1>
Narrowly, it has been equated with a syllabus of a subject and it
contains a set of transmittable knowledge.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-002#25:1>
Some educationalists prefer to confine curriculum to only those overt
activities which are planned and organized intentionally by administrators
and teachers for the students.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-002#26:1>
Others speak of the curriculum to include even things which are not
overtly included in the planning or organizing of learning arrangements but
are learnt by students.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-002#27:1>
There is also the distinction made between the 'official' curriculum
and the 'actual' curriculum.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-002#28:1>
The official curriculum being what is laid down in theory in the form
of prospectus, syllabus, and like documentation; and the actual curriculum
being what is covered in practice.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-002#29:1>
A full definition of the curriculum would be one covering all the
above views.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-002#30:1>
It would be a curriculum embracing all the purposes, principles and
procedures of the whole education system, ranging from national institutional
policies to individual subject syllabus, and consisting of all deliberate and
incidental activities.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-002#31:1>
If one attempts to use such a global definition of the curriculum in
this paper, it would be too wide a scope for this limited discussion.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-002#32:1>
Yet to reduce the definition to anything lesser for the purpose of
this paper, would mean the exclusion of some related areas of consideration
and working in a vacuum to some extent.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-002#33:1>
The compromise would have to be concentration on the more obvious
areas while bearing in mind all the others.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-002#34:1>
This paper would therefore discuss more on the official curriculum
and deliberate activities of a particular subject of a long course, or in the
form of a single short course.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-002#35:1>
<h> Controversial Issue </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-002#36:1>
Several important views about the definition of a controversial issue
have been written.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-002#37:1>
They focus on three areas of consideration and could be summarized to
be the basic requirements for an issue to be considered, and to qualify as a
controversial issue for the curriculum.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-002#38:1>
The three requirements are:

<ICE-SIN:W2A-002#39:1>
a) A controversial issue would be one, which is considered to be
important by an appreciable number of people.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-002#40:1>
b) A controversial issue would divide, be they students, teachers,
administrators or even parents.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-002#41:1>
c) A controversial issue would involve value judgement, which
prevents the issue from being settled by facts, empirical evidence
experimental results.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-002#42:1>
In the above order, these three requirements would be used to
evaluate whether a proposed issue could count as a controversial issue for
the curriculum.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-002#43:1>
<h> Proposed Issue </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-002#44:1>
The case cited is about the introduction of a series of talks into a
part-time professional course conducted by a private institute.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-002#45:1>
In early 1990, the Executive Director informed the affected Unit that
" in response to the emphasis on professionalism, the President met with the
Unit Leaders on a number of occasions to discuss with them the ways of
developing the correct conduct for students to carry with them after
graduation, so that they may display professionalism in their practices.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-002#46:1>
With the help of the Unit on Special Studies, a Talk Series on
Ethical practices has been developed for all students in your Unit.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-002#47:1>
The President has proposed that the Series be given initially to
Part-time students.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-002#48:1>
They would be taught during the first 10 weeks of Semester 1 as part
of the subject on Business Management in the Professional Course.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-002#49:1>
The action of the Unit is to introduce the Series on Ethical
Practices, beginning in the new year".

<ICE-SIN:W2A-002#50:1>
This issue could also be identified to be a controversial issue
because:

<ICE-SIN:W2A-002#51:1>
1) It affects an appreciable number of people, particularly the
students taking the affected subject, not to mention the teachers and
administrators involved in this subject.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-002#52:1>
2) It divides the students, teachers and administrators, particularly
on the selection of different courses for implementation.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-002#53:1>
3) It involves value judgment, particularly as to whether only the
Unit on Special Studies could point the ways of developing the correct
conduct for students to carry with them after graduation, so that they may
display professionalism in their practices.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-002#54:1>
Plan of Action

<ICE-SIN:W2A-002#55:1>
With reference to the meetings of the President and the Unit Leaders
mentioned in the Executive Director's circular, one would gather that a
social change is required.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-002#56:1>
To provide for this kind of changes, education must change in order
to keep pace.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-002#57:1>
In the same circular, one could also conclude that the meetings of
the President and Unit Leaders recognized the need for an innovative change
in the professional education and saw that this educational change must be
deliberately managed rather than be merely left to happen.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-002#58:1>
Thus with the help of the Unit on Special Studies, a Talk Series on
Ethical Practices had been developed for all students in the affected Unit.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-002#59:1>
For the affected Unit, it would be taught to Part-time students as
part of the subject on Business Management in the Professional Course.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-002#60:1>
<h> Consideration </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-002#61:1>
The birth of the Ethical Practices Series which was not left to
chance but carefully thought out and deliberately executed, could be said to
be the results of evolutionary than revolutionary curriculum planning.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-002#62:1>
The syllabus of the Series was completed quicker than the normal
gestation period.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-002#63:1>
The top down imposition of the Series smoothened an otherwise rough
passage of acceptance and implementation in normal courses.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-002#64:1>
The whole exercise seemed to be completed quite efficiently.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-002#65:1>
In the implementation of the directive of the Executive Director,the
curriculum planners in the affected Unit, i.e. staff responsible for
curriculum improvement, were concerned about the basis on which the Ethical
Practices Series could be built into the Business Management Subject.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-002#66:1>
They knew that the curriculum of a course should and had been planned
as a whole.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-002#67:1>
Being multidisciplinary as required by the profession, the
Professional Course is a purposeful arrangement of integrated subjects and
not a simple collection of separate subjects.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-002#68:1>
Their task was to dovetail the series on Ethical Practices in a
complementary manner rather than attach it in a rather piecemeal way into the
subject on Business Management.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-002#69:1>
This was to preserve the overall rationale of the whole course
curriculum.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-002#70:1>
Care was therefore exercised, even to the extent of comparing topic
by topic of the syllabus contents of the proposed series with the ongoing
subject, in order to firstly avoid the duplication of topics, and secondly to
preserve the connection between and among topics.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-002#71:1>
In the implementation of this directive, the subject teachers in the
affected Unit ie both the teachers and the assistants, were concerned about
the effects of the different management and even teaching approaches adopted
by the series and the subject.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-002#72:1>
The series was set in the contingent approach for management while
the subject was anchored on the scientific or production approach for
management.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-002#73:1>
Clearly in the consciousness of the teachers were what students would
learn from the hidden curriculum even though they would not ( be) overtly
recognized by the students themselves.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-002#74:1>
While they accepted that the values and attitudes learnt as by
products of another approach would be additional and good, they were aware
that there would be contradictions arising from the different approaches.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-002#75:1>
They would find it hard to accept responsibilities in what their
students would learn in the unplanned way what would be going on in the 'external'
series.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-002#76:1>
<h> Models </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-002#77:1>
The comparative analysis of the syllabuses of the series and the
subject follows the simple linear model of distinguishing what to achieve (
objectives), what to cover ( contents), what to do ( methods), and what to
control ( evaluations).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-002#78:1>
The monitoring cum control of the effects of covert learning uses a
cyclical model in which the results of an evaluation process of the series by
students the teaching and learning, would help to fine tune the fit between
the series and the subject.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-002#79:1>
Thus, a combination of an objective albeit linear, model; and a
process, using a cyclical and continuous model, was used for implementing the
directive to introduce the series into the subject.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-002#80:1>
<h> Problem in Operation </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-002#81:1>
<h> 1 Pressures </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-002#82:1>
Full cognizance should be given to the influences on the curriculum
planner for they could suppress the controversial issue.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-002#83:1>
At the national and industry level, the influences on curriculum
would be economic, social and sometimes political.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-002#84:1>
The economic function of the education system in building up national
wealth could not be ignored.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-002#85:1>
Society also expects some returns from education on which it has
supported.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-002#86:1>
Political influence on the curriculum could be quite direct with
central decisions on curriculum content and method, leaving little discretion
to the institutions.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-002#87:1>
As the provider, the market have to be satisfied that education is
fulfilling its main economic and social roles and if not, may decide to
effect necessary changes in education to ensure compliance.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-002#88:1>
At the institutional level, the larger concern of the institute and
its management would be on organization and administration.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-002#89:1>
However, curriculum issues cannot be completely ignored because
failure to achieve some understanding of these issues will vitiate any
recommendations made.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-002#90:1>
In the case of the Series on Ethical Practices, the meetings of
President and Unit Leaders was more precise on operational matters than
curriculum issues.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-002#91:1>
The top-down imposition of the series by the President on the
affected Unit left the Unit's Leader, curriculum planners and the subject
teachers, no choices but reluctant acceptance.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-002#92:1>
<h> 2 Responses </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-002#93:1>
Without allowing much debate and particularly response from the
ground, the straight-down introduction of the series into subjects started
off the controversies.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-002#94:1>
At the Unit level, sufficient influence to effect what can and cannot
be attempted, implemented and achieved in the proposed curriculum development
could still be wielded by the internal administration led by the Leader and
administrators through the administrative structures and powers.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-002#95:1>
At the classroom level, the influence of tradition in either the
teaching or the teacher could still be used to hinder and obstruct the
proposed curriculum change.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-002#96:1>
They include certain teachings like approaches and contents which
become so enshrined in respectability and attain such unquestioned
acceptability that they appear to form a compulsory tradition in certain
education.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-002#97:1>
Similarly, teachers could still cling to those forms of practice in
which they were trained in or practiced for years and thus have come to feel
confident in and at home with them. <X>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-002#X98:1>
The bottom-up resistance showed up in the operation of the revised
curriculum.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-002#X99:1>
In name, the planners and teachers toed the line.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-002#X100:1>
However, the enthusiasm and activity that should accompany any new
or revised curriculum are obviously absent in this case of the Ethical
Practices Series in the Business Management Subject.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-002#X101:1>
There were administrative conflicts between the Unit on Special
Studies and the affected Unit due to different organizational structures and
administration practices.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-002#X102:1>
There were also academic competition between teachers of the
Ethical Practices Series and the Business Management Subject due to different
academic traditions and professional training.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-002#X103:1>
3 Compromises In curriculum development and implementation,
external parties are explicitly employed to disseminate experience and ideas,
and advise on the necessary changes when considering overt attempts to
contribute to curriculum development.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-002#X104:1>
An inspectorate plays this role at both central and local levels.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-002#X105:1>
In this case of the controversial issue of introducing the series
into the subject, the Unit on Special Studies could have been acting in the
inspectorate role and playing a mediatory function.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-002#X106:1>
However, due to its direct participation in teaching the series,
the Unit on Special Studies was perceived as the main beneficiary of the
controversial issue by the affected parties and lost the opportunity to be
able to ease the series into the subject. </X> </I>
