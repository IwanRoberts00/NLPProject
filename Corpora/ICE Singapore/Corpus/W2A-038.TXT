<h> Introduction </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-038#6:1>
Expandable polystyrene ( EPS), or Styrofoam as it is commonly known,
is used widely as a packaging material for the protection of goods that are
likely to be damaged during transportation, storage or handling.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-038#7:1>
The EPS-moulded article or cushion is produced commercially by means
of a process quite similar to the plastic injection process, except that the
heat required for fusion of the EPS material beads is obtained by injecting
steam into the aluminium mould.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-038#8:1>
After fusion, the mould is cooled before the moulded cushion is
ejected .

<ICE-SIN:W2A-038#9:1>
Such inefficient use of energy, because of the cyclic heating and
subsequent cooling of the mould, has led to investigations using microwave
energy as an alternative source of energy for the processing of EPS.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-038#10:1>
Earlier studies carried out using microwave energy were unable to
produce desired quality cushions without the inclusion of
carboxylmethylcellulose ( CMC), a binding agent to assist fusion of the beads
[ 1], or sodium chloride, a water-soluble salt used to raise the boiling
point of water to 110@C to enable fusion to take place [ 2].

<ICE-SIN:W2A-038#11:1>
These investigations provided an indication that microwave energy can
be used in the processing of EPS.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-038#12:1>
However, the addition of a binding agent or surfactant is
unacceptable in the packaging industry especially in the packaging of
sensitive electronic products as these agents are likely to contaminate and
corrode the finished goods.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-038#13:1>
A later study conducted by Yeong et al., [ 3] used only water as the
medium to assist fusion of the EPS beads.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-038#14:1>
In this study, the EPS cushions were moulded using pre-expanded beads
as in the commercial process as well raw EPS beads, thereby eliminating the
intermediary pre-expansion stage.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-038#15:1>
Various process parameters and the quality of the moulded cushion
were studied.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-038#16:1>
The dimensional accuracy and uniformity of the bulk density of the
cushion were found to be comparable to those attained in commercial moulded
products using the steam-injection process.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-038#17:1>
However, in these studies [ 3], using a custom-designed mould, two
main problems were faced.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-038#18:1>
Firstly, fusion of the beads, especially close to the top of the
mould, was not entirely satisfactory and secondly, the compressive strength
of the moulded cushion was not completely explored and comparisons made with
commercially-processed cushions.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-038#19:1>
In the present investigation, these two problems have been addressed.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-038#20:1>
Preliminary investigations were made by placing the mould in the
horizontal and vertical planes to study the effect on the fusion of the
moulded cushion.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-038#21:1>
Subsequently, a mechanism was designed and used to rotate the mould
during processing in an attempt to achieve better fusion.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-038#22:1>
The compressive strength of the moulded cushions at various bulk
densities was investigated also.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-038#23:1>
<h> 2. Experimental procedure </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-038#24:1>
<h> 2.1. Equipment and material </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-038#25:1>
In this investigation, a Goldstar microwave oven, model ER-761 ME,
was used.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-038#26:1>
A Mettler PC440 electronic weighing machine was employed to determine
the quantity of EPS material used and the weight of the final moulding.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-038#27:1>
To measure the compressive strength of the cushion samples; an
Instron machine was used: this machine has a 10 kN load cell and a software
package for interface and control.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-038#28:1>
The materials used in the experiments were from BASF and Grade 712
from Dyno Chemical.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-038#29:1>
<h> 2.2. Bakelite mould </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-038#30:1>
In a microwave environment, metal moulds are not suitable.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-038#31:1>
To enable fusion of the EPS material to take place at over 100 C and
to withstand the expansion pressure in the mould, the mould material used
should be heat resistant to at least 120C and be pressure resistant to about
3 bar 14].

<ICE-SIN:W2A-038#32:1>
A phenolic, bakelite, was used to fabricate the mould as it meets
these specifications.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-038#33:1>
The mould was designed and fabricated to produce a product of
cylindrical shape with a blind hole at the centre, as shown in Fig.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-038#34:1>
1.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-038#35:1>
The mould is slightly tapered ( at an angle of 2@) to facilitate
easier ejection of the cushion.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-038#36:1>
The wall thickness of the moulding was designed to be 12 mm to limit
pressure built-up during expansion and fusion of the EPS material.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-038#37:1>
<h> 3. Rotating mechanism </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-038#38:1>
To promote better fusion, a rotating device was designed and
fabricated to rotate the mould about its horizontal axis during processing of
the EPS.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-038#39:1>
The purpose of this mechanism is to rotate the mould such that the
EPS beads were allowed to flow evenly within the mould cavity at the early
stage of expansion of the bends.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-038#40:1>
Teflon was chosen, as the material is easily merchantable and can
withstand the high temperature in the microwave oven.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-038#41:1>
The design of the rotating device consists basically of a rigid frame
structure which houses the clamping device and a series of matching gears, as
shown in Fig.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-038#42:1>
2. The working principle of the rotating device involves the
transmission and translation of the horizontal rotary motion mechanism in the
microwave oven turntable into a vertical rotary motion of the mould.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-038#43:1>
Flexibility in attaining different angular velocities is catered for
within the design by incorporating a provision for the easy change of the
bevel gear ratio and the bushing height.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-038#44:1>
In addition, the clamping device also provides the easy fastening of
the mould to the frame structure, thereby attaining ease of operation for the
rotating mechanism.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-038#45:1>
<h> 2.4. Moulding of the cushions </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-038#46:1>
Two series of experiments were carried out.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-038#47:1>
The first series was carried out to improve the uniformity in the
fusion of the moulded cushion.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-038#48:1>
Preliminary tests were carried out by placing the mould in two other
static orientations ( horizontally and inverted) to determine the effect ( if
any) on the fusion.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-038#49:1>
After this the rotating mechanism was used to determine if the fusion
of the moulded cushion could be improved.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-038#50:1>
In the second series of experiments, cushions moulded without the use
of the rotating mechanism were used to determine the compressive strengths at
various bulk densities of the cushions.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-038#51:1>
3.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-038#52:1>
Results and discussions Since the process parameters that affect the
dimensional accuracy and the bulk densities of the moulded cushions had been
determined earlier [ 3], only the uniformity of fusion and the variation of
the compressive strength with bulk density were investigated in the present
study.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-038#53:1>
<h> 3.1. Preliminary tests with different mould orientations </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-038#54:1>
Previous experimentation carried out [ 3] revealed some degree of
poor fusion at the top of the bakelite mould.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-038#55:1>
This was probably due to the static position of the mould during
processing.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-038#56:1>
As the EPS material beads were at the bottom of the mould, expansion
can only proceed upwards towards the top of the mould.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-038#57:1>
However, as expansion proceeded, fusion also took place and in the
process prevented moisture or steam from reaching the top of the mould.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-038#58:1>
Furthermore, any steam near the top of the mould would have escaped
from the air holes provided in the mould cover.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-038#59:1>
The top EPS beads, deprived of steam, would thus not fuse
sufficiently.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-038#60:1>
To study the effect the mould orientation may have on fusion, two
sets of experiments were carried out.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-038#61:1>
Mould tilted sideways The results of the experiments conducted using
the same process parameters with the mould tilted sideways ( horizontally as
shown in Fig.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-038#62:1>
3) are provided in Table 1 ( see also Fig.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-038#63:1>
4).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-038#64:1>
Inspection of the moulded cushion revealed that again the top of the
moulding had poorer fusion, also with smaller bead sizes than at be bottom
side of the mould.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-038#65:1>
This observation could again be explained by the reasoning that steam
could not be properly channelled to the top side of the mould during
processing.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-038#66:1>
<h> 3.1.2. Mould inverted </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-038#67:1>
Using the same process parameters as in the mould-tilted-sideways
experiments, the results with the mould inverted ( as shown in Fig.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-038#68:1>
5) are given in Table 2 ( see also Fig.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-038#69:1>
6).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-038#70:1>
When the cushion was inspected, it was found that the top surface of
the inverted moulding was properly fused but over-expanded, with some
shrinkage being observed.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-038#71:1>
The bottom portion of the mould had good fusion.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-038#72:1>
The result was probably because the outlet air holes ( now at the
bottom, since the mould is inverted) were sealed with the initial expansion
and the fusion of the EPS beads at the mould bottom.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-038#73:1>
The steam that had already risen to the top was now trapped at the
top of the mould.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-038#74:1>
The presence of steam at the top probably caused the beads to fuse
and over-expand and subsequently led to shrinkage of the cushion after
ejection. <X>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-038#77:1>
<h> 3.2. Moulding with rotating mechanism </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-038#78:1>
A set of experiments was conducted using the rotating mechanism,
providing rotational speed of the mould of 30 rpm.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-038#79:1>
The results obtained are shown in Table 3.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-038#80:1>
Upon inspection of the moulded cushion it was found that the fusion
of the moulding was good and uniform when compared with those moulded with
the static-position mould.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-038#81:1>
This indicates that the rotary motion allowed the material and
watersteam to flow in the mould during processing thereby providing
opportunities for the beads to expand and fuse throughout the mould cavity.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-038#82:1>
3.3. Determination of the variation of compressive strength with bulk
density The compressive strength of the EPS mouldings is one of the
fundamental considerations in the design of packaging cushions.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-038#83:1>
For the Styrofoam industry, the compressive strength is indicated by
the measured value at 10% deformation.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-038#84:1>
As an approximation, the design value used widely in industry to
provide adequate protection of the finished products should not exceed
two-thirds of the measured of the compressive strength [ 5]. <X>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-038#87:1>
It was also found that the compressive strength varies with the
density of the cushion.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-038#88:1>
Provided that the fusion of the moulded cushion is good and uniform,
the compressive strength is expected to be independent of the method used for
moulding the cushion.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-038#89:1>
As the compressive strength using microwave energy had not been
measured in previous studies [ 3], a series of experiments and tests was
carried out to determine the compressive strength using moulded cushions
processed ( without the rotating mechanism) from different quantities of EPS
material ( to obtain different bulk densities).

<ICE-SIN:W2A-038#90:1>
The Instron instrument was used to determine the compressive strength
of the mouldings, with the cross-head speed of the equipment set at 5 mm/min
in accordance with British Standards [ 6].

<ICE-SIN:W2A-038#91:1>
<h> 3.3.1. Measurement of compressive strength </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2A-038#92:1>
To measure the compressive strength a moulding was cut into 3
sections with the top and centre portion each of 15 mm height and the bottom
piece of 20 mm height.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-038#93:1>
Table 4 shows the measurement of the bulk density and the
corresponding compressive strength in kN/m2 at 10% deformation for these
three parts identified as A, B and C.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-038#94:1>
The load versus deformation graph for sample Sl il shown in Fig.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-038#95:1>
7.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-038#96:1>
This graph indicated that the cushion specimen undergoes an initial
elastic characteristic.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-038#97:1>
On further compression, the material undergoes permanent deformation
with the load increasing for the same unit deformation.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-038#98:1>
These experimentation results followed closely the results provided
by BASF, the manufacturer of the raw EPS material [ 5].

<ICE-SIN:W2A-038#99:1>
From Table 4, it can be further noted that localised variations in
density and compressive strength exist.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-038#100:1>
This is to be expected, as the rate of expansion and fusion
throughout the mould would vary depending on the amount of steam passing
through the beads.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-038#101:1>
The extreme result for compressive strength shown in sample S5
section B is probably due to localised poor fusion as the density remained
quite consistent with the rest of the other samples.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-038#102:1>
3.3.2.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-038#103:1>
Compressive strength at various bulk densities i Test samples were
obtained similarly from moulded cushions of different densities and the
compressive strengths were measured.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-038#104:1>
The results are presented in Table 5 and shown graphically in Fig.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-038#105:1>
8.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-038#106:1>
The compressive strength measured at 10% deformation versus the bulk
density of the cushion is shown in Fig.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-038#107:1>
9 and indicates a proportional relationship between these two
factors, with the compressive strength increasing with higher bulk density.

<ICE-SIN:W2A-038#108:1>
This graph can serve as a guide for designers by providing
information on the compressive strength of the cushion once he/she has
decided on the type and density of material to use for the protective
cushion.
