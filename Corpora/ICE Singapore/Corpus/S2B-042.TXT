<ICE-SIN:S2B-042#1:1:A>
I'll talk enough

<ICE-SIN:S2B-042#2:1:A>
I think now

<ICE-SIN:S2B-042#3:1:A>
Good morning uhm now the a to z

<ICE-SIN:S2B-042#4:1:A>
I think I'll prefer to call it z and not z

<ICE-SIN:S2B-042#5:1:A>
A to z of Singapore life

<ICE-SIN:S2B-042#6:1:A>
Actually is a modest attempt at compiling a glossary of the commonly
heard terms and expressions used by Singaporeans in everyday life using Susan
Butler's classification or lexicographical works

<ICE-SIN:S2B-042#7:1:A>
It would fall into the category of Singaporean

<ICE-SIN:S2B-042#8:1:A>
It is a one-person effort

<ICE-SIN:S2B-042#9:1:A>
Something is uh myself to accomplish as a way of educating myself as
well as others about Singapore language and society

<ICE-SIN:S2B-042#10:1:A>
This alphabetically arranged compilation is intended to help the
foreign visitor or expatriate resident who often finds the Singapore variety
of English puzzling

<ICE-SIN:S2B-042#11:1:A>
It is aimed at a general readership which may find this a handy
guide to dip into now and again

<ICE-SIN:S2B-042#12:1:A>
I remember my own experience in Britain when I was given strict
directions and told to look out for the lollipop man before taking the next
turning

<ICE-SIN:S2B-042#13:1:A>
I wasted some time looking out for a non-existent ice-cream or
sweet-seller before it suddenly dawned on me that this referred to the
traffic warden nearby who was holding the large traffic sign like a giant
lollipop

<ICE-SIN:S2B-042#14:1:A>
In Australia I often wondered why there was so many no standing
signs which forbade people to stand on certain parts of the road

<ICE-SIN:S2B-042#15:1:A>
I also felt sorry for poor bill posters who was going to be
prosecuted everywhere

<ICE-SIN:S2B-042#16:1:A>
The sign read bill posters will be prosecuted

<ICE-SIN:S2B-042#17:1:A>
These I later realised were the Australian equivalents of a
Singapore no standing and stick no bills

<ICE-SIN:S2B-042#18:1:A>
Conversely the foreign visitor or local expatriate resident will be
confounded by Singaporeanisms in the following ways

<ICE-SIN:S2B-042#19:1:A>
Either he does not know the meaning of these words or takes them in
their literal sense or is not aware of their full semantic coverage

<ICE-SIN:S2B-042#20:1:A>
For example in the talk of Singaporeans even the meaning of eggs is
not all that straightforward

<ICE-SIN:S2B-042#21:1:A>
There are black eggs which are a Chinese delicacy

<ICE-SIN:S2B-042#22:1:A>
Also known as century eggs

<ICE-SIN:S2B-042#23:1:A>
Red eggs which have a special symbolic meaning because they mark a
baby's one-month celebration

<ICE-SIN:S2B-042#24:1:A>
Salted eggs

<ICE-SIN:S2B-042#25:1:A>
Sometimes salt eggs

<ICE-SIN:S2B-042#26:1:A>
A food which is eaten with porridge and which's often regarded as a
poor man's meal and the idiomatic duck's eggs telor in Malay which is what we
threaten pupils with when they get all their sums wrong

<ICE-SIN:S2B-042#27:1:A>
Even baby's one-month celebration in Singapore is not the same as
the baby's christening in the western sense since the occasion also signifies
the end of the Chinese mother's confinement and that she is clean to return
to normal duties and participate in religious and temple practices

<ICE-SIN:S2B-042#28:1:A>
Although the confinement taboos are not so prevalent today it is
useful nevertheless to know the significance of baby's one month celebration

<ICE-SIN:S2B-042#29:1:A>
Thus the a to z will include entries like baby's one-month
celebration and confinement amah or servant

<ICE-SIN:S2B-042#30:1:A>
Take another example

<ICE-SIN:S2B-042#31:1:A>
Porridge in Singapore is a bowl of plain or savoury rice gruel
which can be cooked with small pieces of meat or fish

<ICE-SIN:S2B-042#32:1:A>
It is very different from the oatmeal porridge served in western
breakfast to which milk or sugar is added

<ICE-SIN:S2B-042#33:1:A>
Then there is also the myriad number of words that are of
non-English origin but which constantly pepper the talk of Singaporeans
giving it its distinctive

<ICE-SIN:S2B-042#34:1:A>
Idiom words like the colloquial rojak gilah kiasu kaypoh and coined
words like moneytheism kiasuism

<ICE-SIN:S2B-042#35:1:A>
The often frowned upon slang words like sabo zap stylo ichified
bluffology pathology and the expressive particles and exclamations like lah
loh meh alamak aya ayoh etcetera

<ICE-SIN:S2B-042#36:1:A>
Singaporeans may well find some of the glosses useful

<ICE-SIN:S2B-042#37:1:A>
Singapore has changed so quickly since its independence and a move
towards economic development urban renewal

<ICE-SIN:S2B-042#38:1:A>
Social progress and national defence has led to the introduction of
many policies schemes campaigns and concepts

<ICE-SIN:S2B-042#39:1:A>
We have generated a whole new crop of terms and expressions in the
last twenty years or so

<ICE-SIN:S2B-042#40:1:A>
Fresh words Singapore colloquialisms constantly emerge among the
youngest set

<ICE-SIN:S2B-042#41:1:A>
The national servicemen the undergrad and the yuppies so that the
older generation the so-called elderly person in Singapore this is someone
over forty may well need a lexical guide to help him unlock the meaning of
the new patio

<ICE-SIN:S2B-042#42:1:A>
As the a to z is intended to be a visitor's handbook it also
includes descriptions of famous buildings and personalities institutions
customs public events and awards and titles festivals items of food and
clothing references to current campaigns and programs and a common
abbreviations and acronyms that has gained currency in everyday talk

<ICE-SIN:S2B-042#43:1:A>
So the glossary should enable someone to understand maybe a
sentence like you should wear the orchid dress to the swing party and dance
the kimo kimo

<ICE-SIN:S2B-042#44:1:A>
Most of the entries have been gleaned from conversation overheard
in buses shopping centres hawker centres at the work-place and at family
reunions

<ICE-SIN:S2B-042#45:1:A>
The range of communicative situations reflected are thus diverse
gossip polite talk argument quarrels instructions jokes sales encounters and
uh oral sources mainly as these contain plenty of examples

<ICE-SIN:S2B-042#46:1:A>
Not a few are derived from the printed medium expecially the
popular new paper local cartoons and also from introspection which I found
most invaluable

<ICE-SIN:S2B-042#47:1:A>
I take heart from Tony Hung's remarks that a person born and bred
in Singapore is the best informant

<ICE-SIN:S2B-042#48:1:A>
In short the a to z compilation encapsulates the very facets of the
Singapore lifestyle in the words expressions and names that express them

<ICE-SIN:S2B-042#49:1:A>
Now the easy part of the task was the description of well-known
landmarks places and people and there were a number of sources one could
refer to

<ICE-SIN:S2B-042#50:1:A>
The problematical part was the selection of the language base
entries to be included in the compilation

<ICE-SIN:S2B-042#51:1:A>
The items used to refer to Sing's ideas and concepts so my
discussion here is confined to the selection of the linguistic entries in
order to be in line with the interest of the workshop

<ICE-SIN:S2B-042#52:1:A>
Now the question as to what to include entails asking questions
like which words are considered Singaporeanisms

<ICE-SIN:S2B-042#53:1:A>
Should taboo expressions be included

<ICE-SIN:S2B-042#54:1:A>
What about the Malay Chinese words which crop up so frequently in
Singapore colloquial speech because they are so expressive and for which no
English equivalents equivalents can be found with the same force of emotion

<ICE-SIN:S2B-042#55:1:A>
Words like gerum where the English frustrated or even frus the
local frus are but weak substitutes

<ICE-SIN:S2B-042#56:1:A>
There are just so many of these cross-borrowings that a decision
must be made at some stage as to the cut-off point

<ICE-SIN:S2B-042#57:1:A>
Should the whole range of particles and exclamations be included
since they occur with such great frequency particularly in the Singapore
basilect signalling the various degrees of agreement disagreement and rapport

<ICE-SIN:S2B-042#58:1:A>
As my work is only half way through I'm leaving the task of final
selection to the end

<ICE-SIN:S2B-042#59:1:A>
At the initial stage my decision was to cast a wide net and to take
in as many items as possible

<ICE-SIN:S2B-042#60:1:A>
All was grease that came to the mill

<ICE-SIN:S2B-042#61:1:A>
I will have to be fairly drastic in the end so as to prune it down
to size

<ICE-SIN:S2B-042#62:1:A>
I don't foresee this to be very easy since the vocabulary is
intended for receptive use and not for production and so warrants a wider
coverage and there is no attempt at prescriptivism

<ICE-SIN:S2B-042#63:1:A>
Words like trishawthon moneytheism ichified will probably make it
into the final list

<ICE-SIN:S2B-042#64:1:A>
However words like born she born a baby bring come or fetch some of
the uh items referred to by Dr Ho Mian Lian and handicap for handicapped
person will probably not be in as uh these are more grammar and pronunciation
errors and their meaning is fairly transparent and matches closely that of
standard English

<ICE-SIN:S2B-042#65:1:A>
Now the main criteria for inclusion is that there must be clear
evidence that the terms and expressions are in general use

<ICE-SIN:S2B-042#66:1:A>
For this I rely heavily on my native competence of Singapore
English

<ICE-SIN:S2B-042#67:1:A>
Now if I had not heard the term or expression before I would
randomly ask two or three people if they knew the meaning of it and base the
merits for its inclusion

<ICE-SIN:S2B-042#68:1:A>
On that basis a word like bus train very evocative bus train now
this really refers to a long line of buses jamming the bus stop

<ICE-SIN:S2B-042#69:1:A>
Not many people know about this so the status is dubious

<ICE-SIN:S2B-042#70:1:A>
There are about 700 linguistic entries so far and the compilation
is still growing albeit at a slower rate

<ICE-SIN:S2B-042#71:1:A>
Now to give you a general list of the entries I shall uh give you
some examples for each of the classification under which they have been
categorised

<ICE-SIN:S2B-042#72:1:A>
The categories are not mutually exclusive

<ICE-SIN:S2B-042#73:1:A>
They are a means for catching as many words as possible

<ICE-SIN:S2B-042#74:1:A>
I believe Dr Ho Chee Lick in his paper tomorrow words in a cultural
context will be discussing the arguments for including some of the categories
mentioned here

<ICE-SIN:S2B-042#75:1:A>
Well the first categories words or census which are common use in
English but which originated from the countries where the early immigrants
came from these words are normally to be found in any standard English
dictionary as they have been accepted as part of the English language

<ICE-SIN:S2B-042#76:1:A>
Attap kampong sarong haji kati sampang

<ICE-SIN:S2B-042#77:1:A>
Malay words Chinese or Chinese origin kongsi samfu towkay and
Indian origin sari chattiah tambi tobi hindi

<ICE-SIN:S2B-042#78:1:A>
Words for this category of item there is a problem of how to depict
their spellings

<ICE-SIN:S2B-042#79:1:A>
Whether to use a regular spellings that have appeared in
dictionaries or to use the present orthography so as to be in line with
spelling reform or language policy changes

<ICE-SIN:S2B-042#80:1:A>
I felt that it would be a good idea to provide both variants

<ICE-SIN:S2B-042#81:1:A>
For example the Malay word kampong kampong or kampung belachan
belachan or belacan and the Chinese words char kway teow or chow guo tiao
yong tow foo or niang tou fu where dialects spellings have given way to hanyu
pinyin versions

<ICE-SIN:S2B-042#82:1:A>
In speech however the dialect words still predominate in a number
of situation for example char kway teow

<ICE-SIN:S2B-042#83:1:A>
Presumably these refer to food items which are popular with the
older generation which are dialect-speaking

<ICE-SIN:S2B-042#84:1:A>
Providing both spelling variants is a good idea since although the
reader uh so that the reader can then recognise the words when spoken and
also uh read the signs at the food centre

<ICE-SIN:S2B-042#85:1:A>
The words have come into Singapore usage more recently do not pose
a problem like feng shui

<ICE-SIN:S2B-042#86:1:A>
Feng shui spelling pretty straightforward here

<ICE-SIN:S2B-042#87:1:A>
Taiji also

<ICE-SIN:S2B-042#88:1:A>
Uhm the second category will be words used in English but have a
different meaning in Singapore usage

<ICE-SIN:S2B-042#89:1:A>
This is probably the category most likely to cause confusion to the
newcomer in Singapore

<ICE-SIN:S2B-042#90:1:A>
Here I have kinship terms used as polite address terms and do not
necessarily indicate a blood relation like auntie uncle brother sister

<ICE-SIN:S2B-042#91:1:A>
Time reference terms every time just next time last time this time
whole life and terms expressing a judgement or opinion

<ICE-SIN:S2B-042#92:1:A>
This is really interesting because of the Singaporean's habit of
understatement perhaps part of his total kiasu philosophy

<ICE-SIN:S2B-042#93:1:A>
Now we have in order uh in uh terms of uh degrees of from good to
bad very nice and good really meaning excellent so if a Singaporean says ni
nice good very nice that is really excellent

<ICE-SIN:S2B-042#94:1:A>
Now alright can do okay so so that means good not very good merely
means satisfactory

<ICE-SIN:S2B-042#95:1:A>
And bad to very bad they have these terms lousy hopeless useless
gone case

<ICE-SIN:S2B-042#96:1:A>
Now the other category would be that ah it's a mixed bag

<ICE-SIN:S2B-042#97:1:A>
I haven't classified them

<ICE-SIN:S2B-042#98:1:A>
This is still under number two

<ICE-SIN:S2B-042#99:1:A>
Missy for nurse in general English

<ICE-SIN:S2B-042#100:1:A>
In Singapore English missy is nurse

<ICE-SIN:S2B-042#101:1:A>
Contractor

<ICE-SIN:S2B-042#102:1:A>
We say my contractor came to do something really means the
decorator

<ICE-SIN:S2B-042#103:1:A>
Slept late means went to bed late

<ICE-SIN:S2B-042#104:1:A>
Elderly I mention someone over forty

<ICE-SIN:S2B-042#105:1:A>
The gloss may well change as perception of age changes with
improvement and health standards and people remaining young longer

<ICE-SIN:S2B-042#106:1:A>
Now third category words spellings or senses used in Singapore
English not but not part of the English language <X>

<ICE-SIN:S2B-042#X107:1:A>
Outside Singapore and Malaysia these can be further sub
categorised into words used in ma Singapore and Malaysia but not sup but not
outside often considered as slang whose use is mostly in colloquial speech
now words like exsi ichified bluffology some of these words have Chinese
stems like hiao becomes hiaosified parto cantonese partology didak
didakparthy how here there's a class of local words which express a verdict
very interesting from slang to howtah logek shiok bolehtahan macham macham
perhaps you may not agree with the classification as lsang but then this is
again debatable and in hokkien lowya now b idoms idiomatic and figurative
expressions now this collecting this was most interesting idioms in English
in Singapore English like no head no tail half past six bottomless pit his
grandfather's house pull strings father's scholarship idioms in Malay in use
in Singapore English chinak bukek guching gurak ikan bilis percha lobang
tarek harga of course you have their equivalents really in the English idiom
percha lobang is actually spill the beans you know they have an equivalent
idiom in English in general English percha lobang literally translates from
Malay to tear a hole or something like that tarek harga to stretch the price
in English it'll be play hard to get now Chinese from Chinese you have
chiahchua literally eat snakes but English in general English would be play
truant liam geng <&>  laugh </&> liam geng that would be recite a prayer literal
translation in English similar equivalent would be give a lecture that in
standard English bao ga liao very interesting bao ga liao meaning everything
included package deal everything included part of his kiasu philosophy chap
zai literally mixed vegetable uh idiomatically it's a mixed bag that kind of
thing mixture and ngiao very interesting too onomatopoeic representation of a
cat sound very ngiao I think but it translates into bitchy or caty but it's
more bitchy actually well another one uh English versions uh where the
English some exist in both the local version and Singapore English like in
Malay you have paly play main main translates into Singapore English play
play both versions come into Singapore you can say don't main main ah don't
play play okay hah his big mouth he mulok besar make noise ah bising bising
ah shake legs goyang kaki both versions hokkien tripod sar kar tripod he sar
kar you know he tripod uh catch no ball liap bo kew okay both versions rice
bin peng tang vomit blood tor hui now another category the fourth one terms
and expressions used to lepict depict local practices customs campaigns
sports crafts local food housing education the environment uh in short the
folk ways and lifestyle of Singaporeans they comprise a collection of English
Chinese or Malay words whole list year customs and festivals a few examples
of each feng shui red eggs ? ceremony paper houses red packet ten course
dinner mass wedding etcetra under schemes we have coupon parking
three-quarter tank rule red light camera thirteenth month allowance plus plus
plus 10 plus 3 etcetra institutions I can't find um or Singapore stereotypes
really the saingapore girl perhaps samsui woman death houses food and food
ingredients this is um quite common char siew fun banana leaf curry etcetra
utensils wok kwalis steamboat fruit and vegetables starfruit jackfruit
etcetra local fruits rambutan durian vegetables kai lan kang kong etcetra
clothing that's common enough orchid dress comes in here uh or or orchid
print games sports and gambling the local sports selak goli taiji chatek
sepak takraw five stones chogek mo modern rongeng gambling four-d chap gee
kee architecture interesting reflecting the changing environment HDB life
void deck terrace apartments point block intermediate terrace bungalow condo
executive flats flatted factory shop house five-foot way environment mama
shop coffee shop um all the abbrevia many abbreviations kimo kimo mono wok
SDU COE POSB gift program now expressions which depict character stereotypes
are in black and white amah not just amah amah also balck and white amah
samsui woman the Singapore girl Centrepoint and Mcdonald kids latch-keyed
children new generation MPs the old guards onetwo-three-four man
one-two-three-four Singaporean the ? graduate mothers filipino maids masaleh
expressions which describe human traits attitudes and emotions kiasu kaypoh
kiamsiap yaokui this's hokkien cantonese we have hamsap Malay we have kayu
katao geelah ayam lo loyaburok English we have loud mouthed chicken feet
cheapskate tripod oily all sorts uh miscellaneous under this category of
ragbag again catered food branded cooked food touting copy watch black market
now exclamations and particles which convey attitudes and emotions
exclamations like the whole list adoey alamak ambouy chilakak or bochok siow
this is not a definitive list I have much more now exclamations uh particles
I won't go through we've got enough of the particles already but three items
under exclamations which seem to me to be interesting why don't I put them in
because they occurred in my corpus when I was recording classrooms in
Singapore I have thirty-one tapes on classsrooms and these there were times
when I had to assign a meaning to these exclamations like yeeee yierh wha now
the teacher waa asking soliciting for questions you know what did the boy see
when the spaceship landed and the one of the uh pupils said oh he saw a man
ah come out and he had a green face or something like that and the pupils in
the class in chorus all say wha wha you know now what did that mean it was an
expression of actually gentle protest or wonder or whatever but this is a
very common exclamation yeee again is very common expression of horror yierh
not so much horror but perhaps dislike so degrees from wha ? yierh and then
yeeee that's the worst kind I think the most intensive now this whether it
will finally go into my list or not I have not yet decided but I'll just
recorded as I said the initial thrust was to bag everything now the items in
some of the classifications are particularly susceptible to change while the
exclamation alamak is still of common currency others like obochok and
kusemangat are heard only among the older generation of peranakans whose
language is fast disappearing these I expect will fall into disuse in a few
years' time as the peranakan elders pass away the entries will have to be
revised regularly already what was a half-tank rule when I first started my
entry was half-tank rule now I've changed it to three-quarter tank rule the
third child is another entry which has to be given a different gloss in the
light of policy change in population control the one-two-three-four
Singaporean will probably also change because of the changing Singaporean
philosophy you know on-two-three-four man one wife two children uh three-room
flat and four wheels unless the characters stereotypes attain the status of
institutions and form an integral part of Singapore's cultural history like
the samsui woman and the black and white amah even what is currently accorded
some sort of institutional status like the Singapore girl may have to be
weeded out eventually the award for example queen's scholar was replaced by
President's scholar when Singapore had its own head of state and pirate taxi
has probably been erased more or less permanently from the immediate memory
of Singaporeans who used to take this trans this form of transport not too
long ago instead of pirate taxis we now have photocopy pirates well as far as
I can foresee the task of compilation is one of on-going revision and
updating thank you </X> </I>
