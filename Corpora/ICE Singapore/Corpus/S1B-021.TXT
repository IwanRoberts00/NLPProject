With me tonight are three observers of the political scene

<ICE-SIN:S1B-021#2:1:A>
Mr Goh Chok Tong has asked for the endorsement for his premiership
and he says the PAP will get their endorsement if it improves on its 1988
percentage                                                        

<ICE-SIN:S1B-021#3:1:A>
By how many percentage points

<ICE-SIN:S1B-021#4:1:A>
Do you think it will have to improve to gain a comfortable margin
Bilveer

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-021#5:1:B>
Ya while dangerous to speculate I think after Nomination Day
results and in view of the lack of general substantive issues ah as I see in
this particular election my guess is to get a clear mandate anything between
sixty four to sixty eight would be regarded in my view as a clear endorsement

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-021#6:1:A>
Thian Ser do you share the view

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-021#7:1:C>
It's not a bad number to put into a ball park area

<ICE-SIN:S1B-021#8:1:C>
In part because the Prime Minister has said that he wants more open
views

<ICE-SIN:S1B-021#9:1:C>
So once you allow a system where you begin to relax uh the system to
allow more people to come in and debate issues there is bound to be uh less
of a consensus that we saw a couple of elections back when it was as high as
eighty odd percent

<ICE-SIN:S1B-021#10:1:C>
So somewhere between sixty odd to seventy

<ICE-SIN:S1B-021#11:1:C>
Seventy'll be a very good number

<ICE-SIN:S1B-021#12:1:C>
I think those are reasonable standards Peter

<$D> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-021#13:1:D>
Well I wouldn't want to box the poor Prime Minister in with
numbers you know because uh I think the the way the campaign is fought you
know is more important than longer term

<ICE-SIN:S1B-021#14:1:D>
It's so easy to say he's got so many more points percentage points
so he's got the endorsement he's done better

<ICE-SIN:S1B-021#15:1:D>
But more important is the people's uh feed uh perception of the
confidence level of the government

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-021#16:1:A>
Well I was coming to that point as to whether you know there
is another measure because he did talk about the people's perception and what
do you understand by that Peter

<$D> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-021#17:1:D>
Well I understand well I don't know what I can't be reading
his mind but I would say this some people are saying look why so kiasu you
know why the suddenness of this election uh and a few other things like that

<ICE-SIN:S1B-021#18:1:D>
Is the gov does the government know something that we don't know

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-021#19:1:B>
Is the economy going to go plunging down

<ICE-SIN:S1B-021#20:1:B>
So I think there's some recovery there you know so it's uh the
perception of how confident government is uh how much leeway it gives the
opposition uh I don't say backward backwards you know because even in sports
you know you you you gain every advantage you can according to the rules of
the game

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-021#21:1:C>
If I could just go back to the point that you made as to why
this election is being called now

<ICE-SIN:S1B-021#22:1:C>
Why in fact is Mr Goh going to the election at this point when uh
after the 1988 election the PAP did say that the win could be interpreted as
a mandate for the new team

<ICE-SIN:S1B-021#23:1:C>
So why in fact is Mr Goh going for an election now

<$D> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-021#24:1:D>
I I think uh because he thinks the conditions are right you
know and this is the best time for the best win

<ICE-SIN:S1B-021#25:1:D>
I think he has put a very strong case that he wants the people to
judge him for who he is and his style

<ICE-SIN:S1B-021#26:1:D>
His National Day Rally performance was by any observer's view a
very good performance

<ICE-SIN:S1B-021#27:1:D>
And he's trying to establish himself once and for all that this is
his cabinet this is his government

<ICE-SIN:S1B-021#28:1:D>
So I think this campaign hangs on his personality and whether the
changes have taken place because we have seen accommodation of uh some of the ?
opposition type views into the PAP's style of government now

<ICE-SIN:S1B-021#29:1:D>
At one time it was the the general consensus was that the
government is very confident of itself it states its case that's it

<ICE-SIN:S1B-021#30:1:D>
But now we're getting a position where the PAP is sort of saying
well we have a position but we're willing to listen to the public we're
listen to to to to the voters

<ICE-SIN:S1B-021#31:1:D>
That's happen in say the ah car policy that's now happening in the
area of health cost

<ICE-SIN:S1B-021#32:1:D>
So I think Mr Goh says to be judged on his personality and approach
it it would be appear to be an important issue here

<ICE-SIN:S1B-021#33:1:D>
I would agree with clear with things here that the real question is
actually political legitimacy

<ICE-SIN:S1B-021#34:1:D>
I think there is a feeling that he has been given the premiership
without the mandate of the people and now he think the timing is right

<ICE-SIN:S1B-021#35:1:D>
Economically politically the ground is sweet that uh this is better
than anytime to go to the people because he will have to go to the people
either 92 or 93 so judging from that political uh soundness I think he's
going to the people for the simple reason of legitimacy nothing more than
that

<$D> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-021#36:1:D>
Well following up from what you say can I say something here?

<ICE-SIN:S1B-021#37:1:D>
He's already there legitimate because at the last election it was
quite clear that year Mr Lee Kuan Yew was going to hand over so uhm the
mandate is already there uhm

<ICE-SIN:S1B-021#38:1:D>
I think there's a clear difference in this time zone Peter in the
sense that since that mandate was given to him he has made several changes
more in style if you like more open approach also substance

<ICE-SIN:S1B-021#39:1:D>
Now this is where this is where the measure is being taken and I
feel that you know the Nomination results are not in his favour because he
will he already has a majority

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-021#40:1:A>
Would you would you say that the change in policy direction
that you talked about is sufficient reason to seek a fresh mandate

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-021#41:1:C>
I think it is sufficient because the change has been happening
fairly rapidly and it's time to take a measure of how people are reacting

<ICE-SIN:S1B-021#42:1:C>
I think the the worries over the economy probably there's some pros
in it I mean what's happened in Russia is very major

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-021#43:1:A>
Is the government concerned about the possible economic
downturn

<ICE-SIN:S1B-021#44:1:A>
I'm not sure they hasn't said that openly but uh many people in the
business sector are concerned of possible fears because cost are still rising
in the economy and that's a problem

<$D> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-021#45:1:D>
And I think in addition to that ah in this country I think
what hits the pocket is politically significant and I think there is a
perception I mean it may be wrong but at least there's a perception even in
the public mind that the economy is taking slowly but surely a flight

<ICE-SIN:S1B-021#46:1:D>
And politically if you don't hit now and you hit later whether in
92 or 93 I think it can be costly

<ICE-SIN:S1B-021#47:1:D>
So it's from that perspective that I think the timing factor and
its relationship with economic cannot be dismissed

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-021#48:1:A>
If we can come back to Mr Goh pushing himself as the issue in
this election uh is there a risk for him in doing this Peter

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-021#49:1:C>
I think uhm it's a big risk but I think being the uh good
politician a good leader that he is he is he has organised the environment so
that uh it's a it's a risk as a bold move it's a risk but uh minimum risk
because uh you know he he's he hasn't talked about opposition type issues

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-021#50:1:B>
Uh I agree with Thian Ser except that I won't call it
opposition type issues I I say the concerns of the people you know

<ICE-SIN:S1B-021#51:1:B>
I think in the past opposition grappled some of those concerns much
better than the PAP but now the PAP has uh has taken the initiative on many
of these issues that affect people's feelings and people's aspirations

<ICE-SIN:S1B-021#52:1:B>
I think one result of a strong victory in this coming general
elections would be that the PAP is seen to have institutionalized itself
because in the past we have the leadership on the Prime Minister Lee very
capable very strong and to a certain extent very dogmatic in approach

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-021#53:1:C>
It's nothing wrong in that it give us twenty-five years of
success but I think what we are saying now is a new approach and if that's a
endorsed strongly by the people then we have seen that most people will
accept that the PAP is get around for many more years to come and perhaps one
good result of that would be that together with that exception uh sorry with
that acceptance of the PAP as a the ruling party as long as it accepts a
wider range of views together with that will be acceptance of opposition

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-021#54:1:A>
Pick up from what you're saying about the opposition now the
SDP has made a call for this election to be treated as a by-election

<ICE-SIN:S1B-021#55:1:A>
How far do you see them getting with this

<$D> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-021#56:1:D>
I think by virtue of the fact that uh the PAP has already had
a walk-over victory this effect is likely to be enhanced that makes Mr Goh's
job a lot tougher

<ICE-SIN:S1B-021#57:1:D>
I think the PAP has to campaign much much strongly

<ICE-SIN:S1B-021#58:1:D>
There are a few uh areas it would appear where candidates who
performed well in the last election are standing again

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-021#59:1:A>
So do you see I'm talking about opposition candidates

<ICE-SIN:S1B-021#60:1:A>
Do you see a replay of some of the major contests for example in
Bukit Gombak and Eunos

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-021#61:1:B>
Possibly possibly I think a lot of people will be watching
Eunos not that the candidates uh put on either side I think because both
sides have put forward interesting candidates and obviously a swing in the
GRC is very significant in terms of the majority and that will have a real
effect

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-021#62:1:C>
I in fact I would differ a bit I think the SDP's strategy is
making a virtue out of necessity

<ICE-SIN:S1B-021#63:1:C>
That's one point of looking at it because I think they will caught
but uh on the other hand about the swing I think basically there are four
factors which will affect an election outcome

<ICE-SIN:S1B-021#64:1:C>
One would be I think the people's desire for a PAP government which
has been achieved

<ICE-SIN:S1B-021#65:1:C>
There are three other factors I think the type and nature of
natural national issues type and nature of local issues and finally they need
to signal to the government about what it can do and cannot do

<ICE-SIN:S1B-021#66:1:C>
I think the the other three will affect the swing and my feeling is
at this present time the ground is far more sweeter compared to 88 when there
were a lot of sulfurist issues and I think I do not uh share Kansas' view
that it's going to be a shift

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-021#67:1:A>
So what you're saying is that there are no national issues
that's bothering the public at this point

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-021#68:1:C>
I I would think there's no national substantive issue which
can fundamentally affect the flavour and uh to that extent I think it's going
to work on Mr Goh's advantage

<ICE-SIN:S1B-021#69:1:C>
I think Mr Goh's halo effect is going to play itself down to the
local constituencies whereas in the past the local issues were very critical
I mean you talk of whether the MP meets the man or not whether that you what
what what type of flats you're living in so on and so forth

<ICE-SIN:S1B-021#70:1:C>
But I think this time now it's different because we are seeing a
major political transition a lot of the past issues were in fact related to
Mr Lee and his style

<ICE-SIN:S1B-021#71:1:C>
This time I think it's Mr Goh and his style and he's seeking an
endorsement

<ICE-SIN:S1B-021#72:1:C>
I think people will go out to vote if not for anything at least for
Mr Goh

<ICE-SIN:S1B-021#73:1:C>
I've heard people saying I like Mr Goh I don't like the MP I don't
know what to do but I'd rather vote with Mr Goh than take a gamble you know

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-021#74:1:A>
Peter do you think in announcing a by-election in twelve to
eighteen months Mr Goh has in fact undercut the strategy of the opposition
<X>

<ICE-SIN:S1B-021#X75:1:A>
I don't think so because uh you know the uh the uh the the bas the
basic strength of the SDP's tactic in saying look let's fight this
by-election is still there you know whether whether it's by-election now or
by-election one and a half years from now so it's a it's a good move on the
SDP and uh it's a it's a very uh compelling argument so we come back to the
point of performance of the candidates and the party's performance so
government must show must I think make uh recognise that uh one big factor is
the Fanner's concept that people now have you know and the fact that
government has reformed today you know it's going to make that an e even more
important factor that you got to appear to be fair I like to take up a point
that Bilveer raise which is that uh the issues are very different this tim eI
think he's right on that score the issues are different but it does not make
the election easier precisely because more people in the constituencies will
be able to take the view well if we have a few more opposition members in
parliament what is so wrong with that uh that's going to be a factor in this
coming elections I think the other point that many people will have to
consider would what kind of manifestos are the opposition parties coming up
with the concept of gracious society is in a way within the PAP's manifesto I
think unless the opposition is not conscious So are you saying then there
really aren't any clear differences between the manifestos of the opposition
and the PAP Bet you PAP will disagree with that But i would I would tend to
say that the PAP have been very successful in hijacking many of the
opposition parties' manifestos especially when it come to talking of uh the
lower classes talking about the poorer people I think this caring
compassionate society has been very successfully uh modelled on by Mr Goh and
it's really I think going to deliver That's one I'm coming to the by-election
strategy I think people are confused you know you have not run your GE you're
already talking about your by-election That's one I think Number two it was
mainly to overcome two basic arguments one was the SDP call for treating it
as a by-election Number two was the J.B.J. problem and the fact that he chose
to address it people amy argue that eh ther's something in it you know you
just can't dismiss it as a ploy a tactic and I think people are beginning to
think seriously about it and that that maybe this is an afterthought rather
than really something thought through and that may in fact hurt Mr Goh in th
long run Do you see the issues changing over the next ten days of the
campaign you know anything can happen from Nomination Day to Polling Day but
uh that's a a gen a general truth I would argue but uh my sense said i would
not feel that fundamental of a change I think there will be basically quite
low-key unless the opposition is able to come on with something out of their
head But Mr Goh has draw has drawn the ground rules in the sense by pitting
himself as the centre of this arena so it will be about mr Goh this time but
perhaps uh longer run the worry will be a about Mr Goh's political role
within the neighbourhood in uh ASEAN and so on the opposition parties need to
come out more strongly with uh manifestos in respect of where they want
Singapore go in the future Well I think it's not a manifesto bad backward all
you know because the positions have have already closed uh closed closed up
the the the uh endorsement of of mr Goh and uh I think he has a lot of
goodwill and a lot of people will vote for him but that would that could be
uh negated to some extent by local issues like constituencies and how the uh
the candidates uh look because the uh I think Singaporeans become more
sophisticated now they they do not accept the argument that unless I have a
the PAP has a bigger mandate in percentage terms is going to be bad for the
country so it's not that black and white lah Now while though the local
issues are important at this particular time in point somehow or another they
have been made quite insignificant by the fact that there is a call and the
call is where does Mr Goh stand not just now maybe in the next decade or so I
think that's very pressing well the last election was described as a
watershed election now if you had to describe this one in just one word what
would you say Peter we'll start with you Turning point Legitimacy Mr Goh's
election Thank you gentlemen for your views well tomorrow the hustings begin
with political rallies and dialogue sessions the campaign will continue for
nine days after which you decide who to give your vote to good night </X>
