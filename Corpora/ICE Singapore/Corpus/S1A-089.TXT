<I>

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#1:1:A>
So the first part will be a brief lit review

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#2:1:B>
What should come first the bit about Singapore or the bit about
this uhm the lit review

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#3:1:A>
Or should we then use this

<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#4:1:A>
We start with here skip that we start with here since this part has
been thrown out anyway

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#5:1:B>
Okay

<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#6:1:B>
Uhm so it's not so much of lit review but a review on Singapore as a
society in composition and

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#7:1:A>
And then a brief mention of the different strategies available
in developing and developed ya

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#8:1:B>
A brief a brief a very brief mention

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#9:1:A>
Then

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#10:1:B>
So the next bit we state in state impacts right on uh state
policies and impacts on household structure first

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#11:1:A>
State impact

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#12:1:B>
Oh we forgot the bit about women

<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#13:1:B>
That's here is it

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#14:1:A>
Ya

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#15:1:B>
Reviewing Sing Singapore women rather

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#16:1:A>
This one will include change in

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#17:1:B>
religious <unclear> word </unclear>

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#18:1:A>
women's

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#19:1:B>
women's structures or something uh

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#20:1:A>
Women's priority ah and change in household structure

<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#21:1:A>
That impact is on this point

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#22:1:B>
So in this case just to review two strengths and policy uh
state policies and the impacts on household structure and state policies on
child care

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#23:1:A>
And some here somewhere here we mention that or here that they
are uhm

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#24:1:B>
Logical uh they've no ethnic bias

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#25:1:A>
Make it more implicit that they they they don't regard one
group above another of this special persons you see

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#26:1:B>
The multi-racial identity

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#27:1:A>
Multi-racial

<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#28:1:A>
And then we talk about the H D B and other housing policy and down
here M C B

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#29:1:B>
Here put all the M C B stuff here then more explicit exactly
what they do

<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#30:1:B>
Right so what we're saying is that uhm because Singapore is
changing uhm traditional forms of child care are now disappearing right and
uh new ones are emerging

<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#31:1:B>
The the state uh is trying to do a couple things

<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#32:1:B>
One is to try to provide alternate means of childcare in terms of
the childcare centres and secondly to try to encourage in some form of that
traditional support structure so it'll carry on that's about all

<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#33:1:B>
Uhm okay

<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#34:1:B>
Ya

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#35:1:A>
What what I do

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#36:1:B>
Fairly nicely right <unclear> word </unclear> to

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#37:1:A>
<unclear> word </unclear> on

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#38:1:B>
Okay first of all we could have all all this stuff about how
uhm childcare centres are very popular so that's part one right with with
women in Singapore

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#39:1:A>
So this will have partial <unclear> word </unclear>

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#40:1:B>
I think we can use like uhm some of the board general idea

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#41:1:A>
Ya

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#42:1:B>
So there will be specific data that which I know data that
across all household types and in in fact across all ethnic groups except or
perhaps the Malays uhm has been a very acceptable form of child care

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#43:1:A>
Childcare centres <unclear> word </unclear> after all
household structures then <unclear> word </unclear>

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#44:1:B>
except uh perhaps the Malays

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#45:1:A>
Malay

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#46:1:B>
Okay and then uhm secondly uhm so that's the response
<unclear> word </unclear> then response to housing to

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#47:1:A>
Energy <unclear> word </unclear> arrangement and <unclear>
word </unclear> and <unclear> word </unclear>

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#48:1:B>
So are we saying that the women like responding fairly well to
this as well to this this strategy this state policy

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#49:1:A>
Perhaps you may not say that the women are responding well but
that uhm this kind of strategy is correct and if the women are shown that
with more than just state rhetoric you know they okay this is working use it

<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#50:1:A>
This is in fact the case that these women are finding it less of a
problem because they have really readily available help at home

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#51:1:B>
Okay

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#52:1:A>
So it is useful

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#53:1:B>
Uhm but uh I think we could then end by saying that uhm that
uhm these have not proven entirely sufficient because women are still finding
or some women are finding it a need to turn to foreign maids

<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#54:1:B>
Uhm what's the other one which is up here

<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#55:1:B>
Foreign maids right and that uh even with all these options there
are still gaps which is which will be the gaps will be all those who quit
right

<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#56:1:B>
And a few household housewives

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#57:1:A>
<unclear> word </unclear> as far as <unclear> word </unclear>

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#58:1:B>
No it's that it's I think it is gelling on all the ideas

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#59:1:A>
that we have been working with and not

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#60:1:B>
The next stage will be the uh economic restructuring phase uh
women quitting and also the cultural constraints <unclear> word </unclear>

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#61:1:A>
I think that's enough nah

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#62:1:B>
Ya and I don't know right I mean if the introduction takes up
if you're talking about like six pages the rest will take up about

<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#63:1:B>
This will take up say three quarters of the page one or two pages
of the page

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#64:1:A>
Aye I think it's more than one

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#65:1:B>
Ya because it has all the data

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#66:1:A>
Ya one and a half maybe

<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#67:1:A>
This one will be about two and a half two and a half

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#68:1:B>
No I can't allow that then we have no more space

<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#69:1:B>
If this is one this is two then this is to be

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#70:1:A>
This is about two and a half

<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#71:1:A>
Two pages

<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#72:1:A>
Should be okay right

<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#73:1:A>
If this is one and a half then two three four five and six

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#74:1:B>
Okay

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#75:1:A>
Should be

<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#76:1:A>
I mean this is this is the maximum

<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#77:1:A>
If you know it's going

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#78:1:B>
It's five hundred pages five hundred words per page right

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#79:1:A>
If it's single <O> Interruption </O>

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#80:1:A>
Uhm Lily wants to know whether you're okay next Tuesday 2:30
pm for I T H G

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#81:1:A>
Okay I've asked her to give it

<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#82:1:A>
Okay so when am I going to get around here

<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#83:1:A>
So should I tell her that you might do when you're slightly

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#84:1:B>
No I don't think you need to tell her that

<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#85:1:B>
She doesn't <unclear> word </unclear>

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#86:1:A>
So sorry well I'll just say that uhm that we left lah

<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#87:1:A>
Should I tell her that we are currently revising

<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#88:1:A>
That's not necessary is that right

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#89:1:B>
Uhm I mean because it does it doesn't concern how she's
already said here that uh she doesn't want her <unclear> word </unclear>
paper give given the the larger papers went in right

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#90:1:A>
Ya and anyway if this comes out <unclear> word </unclear> we
could always refrain

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#91:1:B>
Ya and this this will be different

<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#92:1:B>
It's not it's not it's not about what the household

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#93:1:A>
To feed the household and childcare

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#94:1:B>
These these actually very huge terms you know

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#95:1:A>
So how

<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#96:1:A>
The same in childcare and things like that

<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#97:1:A>
That's too bad

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#98:1:B>
Well leave that as a working title first and when we get round
to it's basically a policy evaluation type paper right

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#99:1:A>
Ya from what what she feel I think it'd be much better to go
along with my

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#100:1:B>
If you want to you could but I don't think necessary but if
you want to you can say that uh you're revising the paper to send it off
elsewhere but uhm you're happy to to summarise the main ideas uh to give
emphasis to state poli policies in Singapore

<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#101:1:B>
Mention the what's this for

<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#102:1:B>
Asian cities <unclear> word </unclear>

<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#103:1:B>
You seem to be getting a bit more mileage out of that conference
that caused you so much agony

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#104:1:A>
Agony

<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#105:1:A>
I think I'm sick because of it

<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#106:1:A>
Must have settle with my bone

<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#107:1:A>
Last night I could not even swallow

<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#108:1:A>
It was so painful because after a talk to Marietha for two hours I
went home I discovered my voice had totally disappeared and my my throat
<unclear> word </unclear> was very very swollen

<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#109:1:A>
Every time I swallowed it was like pain <unclear> word </unclear>

<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#110:1:A>
You know when we have a fish bone stuck in your throat I felt so
bad and <unclear> word </unclear> oh my goodness when I left my medicine at
work because I was so late I just grabbed everything and I went and then I
convey to my husband

<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#111:1:A>
I said this new antibotics you've given me is not working and this
the worse way <unclear> word </unclear> acting on because you can't take all
the others

<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#112:1:A>
But luckily by around six o'clock next morning <unclear> word
</unclear> when I take look at and then I took another one

<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#113:1:A>
So

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#114:1:B>
So what did your husband say it is

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#115:1:A>
It's a throat infection

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#116:1:B>
Throat infection

<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#117:1:B>
Okay so uhm their their deadline is end of January right

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#118:1:A>
I know if I don't get it done we've

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#119:1:B>
I think we'll try to do it by December

<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#120:1:B>
Then you which one is given by <unclear> word </unclear> or the
other

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#121:1:A>
This one is easier lah ah

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#122:1:B>
Sure but they want don't want already so that's more or less
there It will be centre

<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#123:1:B>
This one you know that uhm

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#124:1:A>
I think it's safer to do the other one first because then at
least I know what's ready <unclear> word </unclear>

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#125:1:B>
That's right

<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#126:1:B>
I think we give priority to that one I'll

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#127:1:A>
That day you know you're trying to tell me to do both by
December

<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#128:1:A>
I mean I know it's necessary but it's

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#129:1:B>
Well I have to get round to doing the women's studies one too
and that's like one out of <unclear> word </unclear> twenty

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#130:1:A>
Still haven't revise my <unclear> word </unclear>

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#131:1:B>
Oh that should be quite fast what

<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#132:1:B>
Why don't you do when Fauziah's around

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#133:1:A>
She was she I I gave it to her and <unclear> word </unclear>

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#134:1:B>
It's basically that one section that has been rewritten right

<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#135:1:B>
I don't remember

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#136:1:A>
She she just looked at it and wrote some stuff on the piece
of paper we talked about it and I was like okay okay never mind

<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#137:1:A>
We could say something bad about Sharmala

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#138:1:B>
That is true

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#139:1:A>
And Karmalini ai aiyah what I always say to Karmalini I
always hear them before I see them

<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#140:1:A>
The three studious

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#141:1:B>
Three

<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#142:1:B>
Oh ya uh what's the other girl's name you know the one who's
walked in

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#143:1:A>
Suzanna

<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#144:1:A>
Let's say it loud

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#145:1:B>
Stop this right

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#146:1:A>
No she wants us to continue talking for a while more

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#147:1:B>
Oh

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#148:1:A>
Or you want it back

<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#149:1:A>
Or you want to continue talking for a while more

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#150:1:B>
Uh maybe another what

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#151:1:A>
Do you need it

<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#152:1:A>
If you don't need it it's five minutes

<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#153:1:A>
Okay fine

<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#154:1:A>
You just stay outside

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#155:1:B>
Five minutes ya okay

<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#156:1:B>
Okay so and then uh this so this thing would be about how
multi-generational households different members use how they use space in
different types of flats right

<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#157:1:B>
And uh some themes would be like the how they negotiate public and
private space and uh how uhm how they were maximised

<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#158:1:B>
What what's the term I want where you use the space for multiple
purposes

<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#159:1:B>
Like something could be used as as a sleeping quarters at one
point of time and then change

<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#160:1:B>
No because all like for example smaller flats a bit of constraints
so uh negotiating constraints of space okay like uh multiple functions that
kind of thing right

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#161:1:A>
Or where you have to have two dinner times or that kind of
thing right

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#162:1:B>
Ya I think we just talk about it as temporal

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#163:1:A>
Staggering of

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#164:1:B>
Like bathing

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#165:1:A>
Ya I think it's one F Brenda

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#166:1:B>
Sorry

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#167:1:A>
Staggering off shoo don't bathe today don't eat today

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#168:1:B>
And we could think of other things

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#169:1:A>
Ya and perhaps also like uhm if we do manage to find part of
it in the case study ask them what they would like you know and whether they
could <unclear> word </unclear> extensions extra balcony space and all that
so

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#170:1:B>
This creeps in to the upgrading

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#171:1:A>
We will step on certain people's toes sometimes

<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#172:1:A>
What what physical aspects they will like changed What their

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#173:1:B>
Okay this will particularly be pertinent in the M G flat
which is specially designed

<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#174:1:B>
And then for those for the other two types we could talk about for
the last type the three room we could talk about upgrading

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#175:1:A>
Upgrading

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#176:1:B>
And what they would like to see the extra balcony and all
that Because uhm

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#177:1:A>
Ya <unclear> word </unclear> time

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#178:1:B>
It's it is not mine neighbour but it will be coming soon so
uhm you know we might be able to

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#179:1:A>
It'd be nice to have on the <unclear> word </unclear> have
already had it

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#180:1:B>
But the upgrading process hasn't proceeded far enough

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#181:1:A>
Ya

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#182:1:B>
Because the one in-charge of Jalan Nela was only a few and we
could go and ask

<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#183:1:B>
We could get Louviana to give us the contact

<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#184:1:B>
She did <X>

<ICE-SIN:S1A-089#X185:1:B>
How how is she </X> </I>
