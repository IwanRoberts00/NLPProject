Alvin is seventeen

<ICE-SIN:S2B-024#2:1:A>
He used to cycle out even if it were very late whenever he had
problems with his parents

<ICE-SIN:S2B-024#3:1:A>
Five years ago Alvin was sent to Boys' Town

<ICE-SIN:S2B-024#4:1:A>
His parents felt that they'd lost total control over their son

<ICE-SIN:S2B-024#5:1:A>
And this boy felt the same way too

<ICE-SIN:S2B-024#6:1:A>
After Damian's father passed away four years ago it became difficult
for his mother to keep track of his activities

<ICE-SIN:S2B-024#7:1:A>
He used to come back at odd hours

<ICE-SIN:S2B-024#8:1:A>
Today Damian comes back only on alternate weekends

<ICE-SIN:S2B-024#9:1:A>
The rest of his time is spent at Boys' Town

<ICE-SIN:S2B-024#10:1:A>
He's been there for ten months now

<ICE-SIN:S2B-024#11:1:A>
One reason for this problem is that not enough time is spent with
the children

<ICE-SIN:S2B-024#12:1:A>
But then there's little choice

<ICE-SIN:S2B-024#13:1:A>
Money needs to be earned and food needs to be put on the table

<ICE-SIN:S2B-024#14:1:A>
About nine in ten of the kids at these homes come from lower income
or single-parent families

<ICE-SIN:S2B-024#15:1:A>
With the extended family becoming less common today it's meant that
while parents are out working the child is left to his own devices

<ICE-SIN:S2B-024#16:1:A>
Many may not have taken a wrong turn but some have

<ICE-SIN:S2B-024#17:1:A>
Left alone they're free to do whatever they want with whomever they
want

<ICE-SIN:S2B-024#18:1:A>
Many parents have lost control and in desperation have put their
children into homes like Boys' Town

<ICE-SIN:S2B-024#19:1:A>
They hope that the change of environment and a more structured
lifestyle will instill discipline and councilors like Irene Loy see to that
but not in the way many people expect

<ICE-SIN:S2B-024#20:1:A>
There's no unnecessary caning or severe punishment

<ICE-SIN:S2B-024#21:1:A>
And discipline means following a fixed schedule for meals study
games and housekeeping

<ICE-SIN:S2B-024#22:1:A>
It's rise and shine at 0640 hours and lights out at 2200 hrs

<ICE-SIN:S2B-024#23:1:A>
But discipline alone isn't enough to smoothen the rough edges

<ICE-SIN:S2B-024#24:1:A>
These boys need practical skills and a sound education to give them
a boost when they leave Boys' Town

<ICE-SIN:S2B-024#25:1:A>
Thirty of the seventy-six boarders learn a trade at Boys' Town
Vocational Institute

<ICE-SIN:S2B-024#26:1:A>
The remaining forty-six attend Assumption English School which's
next door and study with a thousand others students

<ICE-SIN:S2B-024#27:1:A>
But how do these students feel about their classmates from Boys'
Town

<ICE-SIN:S2B-024#28:1:A>
But unfortunately acceptance remains confine to those who study
teach and play with the boys

<ICE-SIN:S2B-024#29:1:A>
To study together to share their problems thoughts and hopes this
is what the home has come to mean for these boys

<ICE-SIN:S2B-024#30:1:A>
So after a while being there doesn't seem so bad

<ICE-SIN:S2B-024#31:1:A>
There's a feeling that there're all in it together

<ICE-SIN:S2B-024#32:1:A>
And change is also a key word at the Haven

<ICE-SIN:S2B-024#33:1:A>
This home run by the Salvation Army takes in children from families
with problems

<ICE-SIN:S2B-024#34:1:A>
But they're younger between ten to thirteen years

<ICE-SIN:S2B-024#35:1:A>
To protect them from prejudices we're even told not to show their
faces

<ICE-SIN:S2B-024#36:1:A>
The Haven hopes that by reaching them at such a tender age the
child will be able to escape a vicious circle of problem families

<ICE-SIN:S2B-024#37:1:A>
John Nickelson has been a social worker for over thirty years now
and he gave producer Silvan Poi his views

<ICE-SIN:S2B-024#38:1:A>
So the approach is that residential care should only be the last
resort

<ICE-SIN:S2B-024#39:1:A>
But sadly there are parents who have pushed the responsibility to
the home saying that it can take better care of their child

<ICE-SIN:S2B-024#40:1:A>
And that's where the Teen Challenge Crisis Care can help

<ICE-SIN:S2B-024#41:1:A>
The home services are temporary shelter for troubled teens many who
are runaways

<ICE-SIN:S2B-024#42:1:A>
And that's the aim for all these homes

<ICE-SIN:S2B-024#43:1:A>
The eventual reconciliation of the family unit

<ICE-SIN:S2B-024#44:1:A>
Although not all cases are success stories those that do make it
are much better for the experience

<ICE-SIN:S2B-024#45:1:A>
After five years Alvin's relationship with his parents is much
better

<ICE-SIN:S2B-024#46:1:A>
Now he can talk to them

<ICE-SIN:S2B-024#47:1:A>
It's also his last year in Boy's Town and his outlook on life is
clearer

<ICE-SIN:S2B-024#48:1:A>
He wants to go to the Temasek Polytechnic to study graphics

<ICE-SIN:S2B-024#49:1:A>
So how does he feel about Boys' Town now

<ICE-SIN:S2B-024#50:1:A>
So there is hope

<ICE-SIN:S2B-024#51:1:A>
For Damien he's just beginning to feel the change in himself

<ICE-SIN:S2B-024#52:1:A>
Being at Boys' Town only ten month he still got some ways to go

<ICE-SIN:S2B-024#53:1:A>
But he is more tolerant of his mother now and he's finding out that
there's more to life than just doing what he wants to do </I>

Four times a week for the last three years David Wee has been
attending a private law school

<ICE-SIN:S2B-024#55:2:B>
He's a full-time student and will be taking his exams this June

<ICE-SIN:S2B-024#56:2:B>
It hasn't been easy studying law on his own but then David didn't
have much of a choice

<ICE-SIN:S2B-024#57:2:B>
And going abroad was out of the question

<ICE-SIN:S2B-024#58:2:B>
Like David almost half his classmates are striving towards the same
goal to be a lawyer

<ICE-SIN:S2B-024#59:2:B>
But for various reasons they're not doing it the usual way through
the university

<ICE-SIN:S2B-024#60:2:B>
All are however serious about achieving their dream

<ICE-SIN:S2B-024#61:2:B>
But it's an uphill struggle for them for some are able to do it
full-time many aren't as fortunate

<ICE-SIN:S2B-024#62:2:B>
Peter Ong is one such person

<ICE-SIN:S2B-024#63:2:B>
He's a second year external law student from another private school

<ICE-SIN:S2B-024#64:2:B>
But time is a luxury they can't afford

<ICE-SIN:S2B-024#65:2:B>
The external degree they're working for now is recognised only up
till nineteen ninety-six for admission to the bar which is what qualifies
them as a lawyer

<ICE-SIN:S2B-024#66:2:B>
After nineteen ninety-six too bad

<ICE-SIN:S2B-024#67:2:B>
A law degree yes but no hope of actually becoming a lawyer

<ICE-SIN:S2B-024#68:2:B>
In the report published by the committee for the supply of lawyers
the members said we do not accept that the holder of the external degree is
comparable to the holder of a LLB NUS degree

<ICE-SIN:S2B-024#69:2:B>
And the reason for this they feel that external students aren't in
university because of their lower A level qualifications

<ICE-SIN:S2B-024#70:2:B>
And because they aren't in university they wouldn't have benefited
from what the committee calls an intellectual environment which conduces to a
deeper and better understanding of the law and its role in society

<ICE-SIN:S2B-024#71:2:B>
In other words the committee believes that because external
students did not go to a proper school they won't make good lawyers

<ICE-SIN:S2B-024#72:2:B>
And the course David sought isn't that much different from what
students in UK universities are doing

<ICE-SIN:S2B-024#73:2:B>
In fact it's the external programme conducted by the University of
London

<ICE-SIN:S2B-024#74:2:B>
It's a three year course with exams at the end of each year

<ICE-SIN:S2B-024#75:2:B>
The only difference external students can study at their own pace
and only sit for each exam when they feel ready

<ICE-SIN:S2B-024#76:2:B>
So they can take anything from three to eight years to get a degree

<ICE-SIN:S2B-024#77:2:B>
But even so the exams they take will still have to meet certain
standards

<ICE-SIN:S2B-024#78:2:B>
S Kunalan a former external law student has a Masters degree with
distinction from the University of London and he's been teaching external law
students for eight years

<ICE-SIN:S2B-024#79:2:B>
Another words the university expects the same standard from both
its internal and external students

<ICE-SIN:S2B-024#80:2:B>
That's not all

<ICE-SIN:S2B-024#81:2:B>
Passing the basic degree exam is one thing but it doesn't qualify
them as a lawyer

<ICE-SIN:S2B-024#82:2:B>
They still have to sit for the English bar exam

<ICE-SIN:S2B-024#83:2:B>
And this they can't do if they get anything less than a second
class lower Honours

<ICE-SIN:S2B-024#84:2:B>
And to make things harder the pass rate at English bar is less than
thirty per cent

<ICE-SIN:S2B-024#85:2:B>
Chandran Mohanair is a partner in a law firm and Vice-President of
the Law Society

<ICE-SIN:S2B-024#86:2:B>
He agrees universities can produce good law graduates but more is
required

<ICE-SIN:S2B-024#87:2:B>
Whether or not external law students are of lower calibre than
university students is debatable

<ICE-SIN:S2B-024#88:2:B>
But what's clear however is this

<ICE-SIN:S2B-024#89:2:B>
External law students have to pass a basic degree exam which is
similar to that taken by UK students and all of them also have to pass the
same bar exam

<ICE-SIN:S2B-024#90:2:B>
So surely there's no reason to assume that every external law
degree holder is inferior

<ICE-SIN:S2B-024#91:2:B>
And what's more to carry that assumption so far as to deny them the
chance to prove themselves

<ICE-SIN:S2B-024#92:2:B>
Classes may be over for the day for these students

<ICE-SIN:S2B-024#93:2:B>
But for David that only means it's revision time after all he has a
deadline to beat </I>

<ICE-SIN:S2B-024#94:3:C>
Established one hundred and seven years ago ACS the best is
yet to be striving towards an all-round education reaching the mind the heart
and even the soul

<ICE-SIN:S2B-024#95:3:C>
Every aspect of the school is planned and built towards making sure
that the boys are given the most and the best right down to little details
that make school feel like home

<ICE-SIN:S2B-024#96:3:C>
Each student pays two hundred dollars a month which sure helps a
lot in getting the school on its feet and going

<ICE-SIN:S2B-024#97:3:C>
The school has an administrative staff of seven clerks four
secretaries one bursar two vice-principals and one principal

<ICE-SIN:S2B-024#98:3:C>
All to manage the massive paper work logistics and plans necessary
to keep the school in fighting shape

<ICE-SIN:S2B-024#99:3:C>
And this is certainly a relief I'm sure to the teachers some one
hundred and twenty-eight of them who can now at least concentrate on what
they do best

<ICE-SIN:S2B-024#100:3:C>
And most of these teachers are graduates hand picked by the
principal himself

<ICE-SIN:S2B-024#101:3:C>
I dropped in a class of boys revising for a geography exam

<ICE-SIN:S2B-024#102:3:C>
This ratio of one teacher to fifteen students certainly makes
teaching and learning a different experience all together

<ICE-SIN:S2B-024#103:3:C>
And you wonder where are the exercise books

<ICE-SIN:S2B-024#104:3:C>
In this set up each student gets individual attention

<ICE-SIN:S2B-024#105:3:C>
And it's refreshing to see how on the spot learning of mistakes
take place

<ICE-SIN:S2B-024#106:3:C>
Also the students learn how to interact with each other all within
the cool and conducive environment

<ICE-SIN:S2B-024#107:3:C>
It means <unclear> word </unclear> whole culture or group sharing
and learning is simply a way of life in the school

<ICE-SIN:S2B-024#108:3:C>
Beauty and the beast

<ICE-SIN:S2B-024#109:3:C>
Now this secondary four class was learning reading and
comprehension skills in a fun well funny way

<ICE-SIN:S2B-024#110:3:C>
So each class at whichever level is the same yet different because
teacher and pupil are allowed to experiment and come up with new ideas from
whatever way so long as learning takes place

<ICE-SIN:S2B-024#111:3:C>
Yes a lesson in stress management for these fourteen year olds and
the boys tell it all

<ICE-SIN:S2B-024#112:3:C>
This is all part of a pastoral care programme that looks after the
boys' emotional needs

<ICE-SIN:S2B-024#113:3:C>
It also prepares them to face the world like an adult and confront
problems with each other

<ICE-SIN:S2B-024#114:3:C>
And who wouldn't be able to build up his confidence if you've to
stand in front of your friends just about everyday in almost every class

<ICE-SIN:S2B-024#115:3:C>
The essence of education the molding of each student's character
and what better way than through enrichment programmes so that he finds
within himself something he likes something he knows is uniquely his
something to show the world who he is

<ICE-SIN:S2B-024#116:3:C>
And the chance to create and be spurred on to do even better

<ICE-SIN:S2B-024#117:3:C>
So after almost one year of teething problems ACS not unlike the
other seven independent schools has began to start a standard of education
which I believe is going to be a tough act to follow

<ICE-SIN:S2B-024#118:3:C>
Simply because of its whole support system in terms of its funding
alumni teaching and non-teaching staff

<ICE-SIN:S2B-024#119:3:C>
Also the school has complete freedom to plan and chart each
student's future

<ICE-SIN:S2B-024#120:3:C>
Now all these things are absolutely crucial in ensuring the
school's strength and success

<ICE-SIN:S2B-024#121:3:C>
So can autonomous schools match up

<ICE-SIN:S2B-024#122:3:C>
Well so far details released by the education ministry on
autonomous schools show that they'll remain as either government or aided
schools

<ICE-SIN:S2B-024#123:3:C>
Funding the government will give them seven hundred thousand
dollars more for an enrolment of fifteen hundred students

<ICE-SIN:S2B-024#124:3:C>
This is to help them introduce new enrichment programmes

<ICE-SIN:S2B-024#125:3:C>
School fees will be between fifteen dollars and thirty-two dollars

<ICE-SIN:S2B-024#126:3:C>
Teachers will still come under the ministry but principals will
have more say in selecting who they want on their staff

<ICE-SIN:S2B-024#127:3:C>
They can also hire new staff for enrichment programmes and support
services

<ICE-SIN:S2B-024#128:3:C>
And as far as class size is concerned that will remain the same

<ICE-SIN:S2B-024#129:3:C>
The education minister had also said autonomous schools would be
more like an intermediate grade of schools between independent schools and
neighbourhood schools

<ICE-SIN:S2B-024#130:3:C>
Many principals like mister Tan Teck Kwee from Victoria School
welcome this idea

<ICE-SIN:S2B-024#131:3:C>
However some parents while they welcome the setting up of
autonomous schools believe we shouldn't expect too much out of them <X>

<ICE-SIN:S2B-024#X132:3:C>
And doctor Gwee Ee Hian and academic consultant sees yet another
reason why autonomous schools may not match up to their independent
counterparts Well what does the education minister think Well one thing for
sure for parents like Lawrence Teo autonomous schools is a welcome choice
</X> </I>
