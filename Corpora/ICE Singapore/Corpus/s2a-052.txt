<ICE-SIN:S2A-052#1:1>
Good afternoon

<ICE-SIN:S2A-052#2:1>
Ah my name is Iris Ching and and I'm the Software Consultants

<ICE-SIN:S2A-052#3:1>
Welcome you to our this Easy Asset II and Easy Cash seminar

<ICE-SIN:S2A-052#4:1>
So uh before I explain into our package of uh computerising the Fixed
Asset which is the first session of the seminar and the second session will
be on Easy Cash which is the general ledger package plus the cash management
system session I will like to briefly explain ah what actually how you can
successfully use our package to computerise your system

<ICE-SIN:S2A-052#5:1>
Okay uh our system runs mainly all on PC-base and uh you could use a
IBM compatible PC or running on an MS-DOS system which can be running on
version five or below and uh it goes on an unlimited databased system okay

<ICE-SIN:S2A-052#6:1>
Now if you are looking into uh how many of you are actually looking
into a G/L package over here

<ICE-SIN:S2A-052#7:1>
Yourself is it

<ICE-SIN:S2A-052#8:1>
And uh what kind of G/L package you are looking into

<ICE-SIN:S2A-052#9:1>
A multiuser or a single-user

<ICE-SIN:S2A-052#10:1>
Single-user

<ICE-SIN:S2A-052#11:1>
So it's no problem because our system runs on a 
single-user basis and it has this ah multi passwords whereby you will give you 
this security purposes and uh what about yourself

<ICE-SIN:S2A-052#12:1>
Eileen

<ICE-SIN:S2A-052#13:1>
Not at the moment

<ICE-SIN:S2A-052#14:1>
Ya I have seen ah in <unclear> word </unclear> and you are also
looking into Fixed Asset system

<ICE-SIN:S2A-052#15:1>
You are looking into that

<ICE-SIN:S2A-052#16:1>
Ah okay this Easy Asset II is a new upgrade or we call it a new
release version for this year

<ICE-SIN:S2A-052#17:1>
Previously we know it's known as Easy Asset and the package for this
one compared to the old version there's a difference is this one goes
unlimited database

<ICE-SIN:S2A-052#18:1>
The other version is limit up to a thousand five of records it can
enter

<ICE-SIN:S2A-052#19:1>
Now this one goes unlimited so you don't have to worry about the Easy
Asset II

<ICE-SIN:S2A-052#20:1>
If you have number on or you call the volume of assets increasing per
year then you will not have this problem of you know up to a certain limit
you cannot carry on your system

<ICE-SIN:S2A-052#21:1>
So okay let me run down this system for you so that you could
understand better of the features and also the operations of it

<ICE-SIN:S2A-052#22:1>
Now as you can see this is the introduction whereby it tells you that
this package is developed by our own company and it's developed in Singapore
okay specially for the Singapore office but we also cater for oversea office
because Fixed Asset system is more or less quite uh I should say it's quite
consistent throughout internationally

<ICE-SIN:S2A-052#23:1>
The laws of uh supposing like the functions like depreciation by how
many straight line methods and all that or balancing on reducing balance or
double declining balance

<ICE-SIN:S2A-052#24:1>
So it's more or less quite standard in the sense

<ICE-SIN:S2A-052#25:1>
Okay the first thing you can see that over over your left side if I'm
going to sit this way it's going to be over my left side the database window
is goes unlimited database so you can have number of databases there

<ICE-SIN:S2A-052#26:1>
Does not matter

<ICE-SIN:S2A-052#27:1>
It can scroll on and on

<ICE-SIN:S2A-052#28:1>
You have number of companies if you are using just one package to
control number of companies' assets

<ICE-SIN:S2A-052#29:1>
So you can just use a macro key and zoom into any one of these
database that you already built in the system

<ICE-SIN:S2A-052#30:1>
Okay let's say this is the database that you have put in the system
call the EA2SAM and you are going into the period

<ICE-SIN:S2A-052#31:1>
Okay the fiscal period depends on how you identify your fiscal period

<ICE-SIN:S2A-052#32:1>
Let's say you go into a fiscal period of twelve which is you classify
that now your fiscal period is December

<ICE-SIN:S2A-052#33:1>
Okay and you proceed on enter your password

<ICE-SIN:S2A-052#34:1>
Now your password here allows you you can see it allows you more than
enough okay

<ICE-SIN:S2A-052#35:1>
And right over here once you enter into this password you will come
to the actual main menu and you can start having your computerisation

<ICE-SIN:S2A-052#36:1>
First of all building the parameter set

<ICE-SIN:S2A-052#37:1>
Okay under this parameter set you have what you call miscellaneous
parameters where this is where you set up

<ICE-SIN:S2A-052#38:1>
Okay you're start off computerisation fiscal period

<ICE-SIN:S2A-052#39:1>
Is it you're starting as a fiscal period six

<ICE-SIN:S2A-052#40:1>
Okay let's say it's six is your fiscal period

<ICE-SIN:S2A-052#41:1>
Now you can see the change automatically over there

<ICE-SIN:S2A-052#42:1>
The period end date which means your first fiscal period accounting
month is on June

<ICE-SIN:S2A-052#43:1>
Thirtieth of June nineteen-ninety-one ending and your last fiscal
period twelve will be ending thirty-first May nineteen-ninety-two

<ICE-SIN:S2A-052#44:1>
You do not have to go into that particular parameters to set the date

<ICE-SIN:S2A-052#45:1>
There is an auto-control

<ICE-SIN:S2A-052#46:1>
Okay

<ICE-SIN:S2A-052#47:1>
Now if you set your this first accounting period first fiscal
accounting period month as one which is January

<ICE-SIN:S2A-052#48:1>
Now you go and change go right into a company's name you can see that
it overrides your first fiscal period becomes thirty-first January ninety-one
and your ending fiscal period twelve is thirty-first December ninety-one

<ICE-SIN:S2A-052#49:1>
So this is how our system controls over the parameters now if you are
going into the subsequent years of ninety-two

<ICE-SIN:S2A-052#50:1>
Okay all you require is you put in the current accounting year which
is ninety-two

<ICE-SIN:S2A-052#51:1>
Now you can see over there on the period end-date it has
automatically change for you to nineteen-ninety-two

<ICE-SIN:S2A-052#52:1>
Okay

<ICE-SIN:S2A-052#53:1>
So this is how the computerisation helps you to speed up in certain
ways of control

<ICE-SIN:S2A-052#54:1>
And right over here you put in the company's profile which is your
company's name the address and the other information

<ICE-SIN:S2A-052#55:1>
Okay

<ICE-SIN:S2A-052#56:1>
Over here you can see that you will have to enter the standard
currency

<ICE-SIN:S2A-052#57:1>
Okay your standard currency can be you can controlled as US dollar as
your standard company's currency or you use Singapore dollar as a standard
currency control

<ICE-SIN:S2A-052#58:1>
So you can enter over here and this means that how many decimal place
are you giving two decimal or four decimal place

<ICE-SIN:S2A-052#59:1>
So you can use it over here and all currency name now this one will
be in US dollar or maybe you want it to be an alternate currency in Malaysian
dollar or whichever other cur country currencies you want it to be an
alternate currency

<ICE-SIN:S2A-052#60:1>
Now the decimal place is up to you to identify and the exchange rate
is also up to your company's standard company's exchange rate

<ICE-SIN:S2A-052#61:1>
And over here the you will also have this what you call the capital
allowances whether you are allowing the capital allowance less initial amount
or full amount

<ICE-SIN:S2A-052#62:1>
So it's up to you to set the parameters over here

<ICE-SIN:S2A-052#63:1>
Now your full-year depreciation or prorated when we talk about
full-year depreciation means you're taking a full-year depreciation to equal
so that you will divide by twelve month

<ICE-SIN:S2A-052#64:1>
Your depreciation will be spread out equally okay for the twelve
months

<ICE-SIN:S2A-052#65:1>
Let's said if one asset is twelve thousand so you use full-year
you're spread out twelve thousand divide by twelve equals to one thousand per
month

<ICE-SIN:S2A-052#66:1>
That will be the depreciation amount

<ICE-SIN:S2A-052#67:1>
Now if you are taking a pro-rate it means it will pro-rate
accordingly by the month so you will pro-rate for example by the date that
you acquire starts

<ICE-SIN:S2A-052#68:1>
Okay you depreciate according to that date and you pro-rate
accordingly by rounding up the amount that is to certain months

<ICE-SIN:S2A-052#69:1>
So this is the method that you could identify over here in the
parameters

<ICE-SIN:S2A-052#70:1>
Now spaces between labels is up to you to identify what type of
labels you are actually using to print numeric the asset labels for your
company and you also have the audit <unclear> word </unclear> and right over
here you have the location of DOS location of document custom

<ICE-SIN:S2A-052#71:1>
Now this location means a lot of people ask what is this location
means Now this location means you can actually default okay in the C drive or
D drive accordingly or you can have it set a default into the A drive by
putting this function in this odd manner and under this directory okay and
the file name or whatever will be default in the A drive or C drive or D
drive

<ICE-SIN:S2A-052#72:1>
Okay if you set it you set it this way and right over here let me
take this out for you okay

<ICE-SIN:S2A-052#73:1>
Now right over here you can see that there are a number of colours
for you to select

<ICE-SIN:S2A-052#74:1>
Two hundred and fifty-five colours

<ICE-SIN:S2A-052#75:1>
So you can if you feel tired of any of the colours you want to play
around with other colours you can just switch over with the help of this box
colour here

<ICE-SIN:S2A-052#76:1>
Now right over here will be your set-up of the column paper width

<ICE-SIN:S2A-052#77:1>
Okay now if you are using a printer which is eighty column width then
you identify as eighty okay

<ICE-SIN:S2A-052#78:1>
If you are using a printer that is for printing of hundred and
thirty-two column width paper you can override this eighty column to hundred
and thirty-two column width

<ICE-SIN:S2A-052#79:1>
So this will enables you to set accordingly to your company's printer
configurations and it has this special condensed intelligence of the reports

<ICE-SIN:S2A-052#80:1>
Uh the modes for you for example if the reports exceed hundred and
thirty-two which is for the eighty column width it come to hundred and
thirty-two maximum

<ICE-SIN:S2A-052#81:1>
Now the system will condense the reports automatically for you
without having you to set the kind of condense mode

<ICE-SIN:S2A-052#82:1>
Okay now if you save this parameter and you only do it once you don't
want to come back and change and change again you only change it every
beginning of the year and okay the next step you go is the update of codes

<ICE-SIN:S2A-052#83:1>
Now you may a codes for category the supplier code country subgroup
location G\L account number and you may have cost centre number and let's go
into one of this

<ICE-SIN:S2A-052#84:1>
Okay let me go into the category I'll show it to you

<ICE-SIN:S2A-052#85:1>
Now under this category code you may want to identify you may want to
identify a certain code

<ICE-SIN:S2A-052#86:1>
Now this code is four limit to four alphanumeric code

<ICE-SIN:S2A-052#87:1>
You can have E001 or something else that you like to call or EA01 or
you can even identify this way all in alpha but it's four alphanumeric

<ICE-SIN:S2A-052#88:1>
Okay now from here the description is up to you to identify what you
want to call Fixed Asset okay equipment you may call an equipment

<ICE-SIN:S2A-052#89:1>
Now the next one you may want to call something like FF which is
Fixtures and Fitting okay and you may want to fix up this one as this
description

<ICE-SIN:S2A-052#90:1>
So let's save this one into the window so you will have what you call
uh FF code and it's the description is considered as Fixtures and Fittings
okay

<ICE-SIN:S2A-052#91:1>
After this you may want to continue okay updating or creating the
other codes

<ICE-SIN:S2A-052#92:1>
Now you don't have to get out of this windows

<ICE-SIN:S2A-052#93:1>
All you need is just press and F five key which is the macro key to
help you to select into the others build a supplier code and or go into a
country okay to establish at the other codes for you

<ICE-SIN:S2A-052#94:1>
Okay let's say you want to build another country codes like uh
Malaysia

<ICE-SIN:S2A-052#95:1>
So you just key in M one it can be alphanumeric also and you put
Malaysia okay

<ICE-SIN:S2A-052#96:1>
So this one will enable you to carry on okay building doing all the
other codes without having to to be out of this function

<ICE-SIN:S2A-052#97:1>
Now you can also go into cost centre and then start building your
cost centre codes and descriptions

<ICE-SIN:S2A-052#98:1>
So if you have completely okay set up the parameters for all this you
can just come out of this function and go into the printing modes

<ICE-SIN:S2A-052#99:1>
Now you can print all this that you already actually set up the table
codes okay and right here system passwords

<ICE-SIN:S2A-052#100:1>
After having all this set up you can go into what you call a system
password where you can just build a system password for a certain level of
people <X>

<ICE-SIN:S2A-052#X101:1>
You can have master you can have the other stock levels so that
only certain level of people can get assess to certain functions only </X>
