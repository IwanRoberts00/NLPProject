Question: If Gulliver is an unreliable narrator, the narrator of
Rasselas is a dictator.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-001#2:1>
As such both are vehicles for distortion.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-001#3:1>
Would you agree with this assessment?

<ICE-SIN:W1A-001#4:1>
Answer: The narrative technique of Gulliver's Travels and Rasselas
differs vastly.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-001#5:1>
In the former, the narrator is a character of the story while in the
latter, the narrator is the detached and omniscient type.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-001#6:1>
Both stories, being very different in nature, would warrant very
different responses to the story as well as to the narrators of each book.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-001#7:1>
In Gulliver's Travels, we respond to Gulliver, the narrator,
differently.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-001#8:1>
Firstly, because of the fantastic nature of the tale and secondly,
because Swift the author is not the same as Gulliver the narrator and that
Swift is satirising Gulliver.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-001#9:1>
Therefore our response to the narrator of Gulliver's Travels is often
more tainted with suspicion.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-001#10:1>
And in Rasselas, the use of the all-knowing narrator also alters the
ways we see the story because such a narrator is at liberty to " impose" on
the readers anything he sees fit.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-001#11:1>
In Gulliver's Travels, because we are seeing the entire story through
Gulliver's eyes and from his perspective and he is a character actively
involved in the storyline itself, it therefore becomes inevitable that an
element of unreliability would exist in the narration.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-001#12:1>
Because we are, after all, receiving a second-hand account that had
been subjected to Gulliver's own questionable sense of assessment and
value-judgement.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-001#13:1>
In fact, the opening letters of the novel already sets in us such a
mood of uncertainty.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-001#14:1>
The publisher and Gulliver appears to be giving us different
accounts, with Gulliver accusing the Publisher of altering his manuscript, he
said,"You have either omitted some material circumstance, or minced or
changed them in such a manner, that I do hardly know mine own work."
Therefore, right from the beginning, we are told that Gulliver's so called "
truthful" account has been tampered with and as such, it forces us to
question the reliability of what we are reading.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-001#15:1>
Also, we, as readers, are several removes away - with Swift as the
ultimate controller of the story who controls the narrator, Gulliver, whose
manuscripts had been tampered with by the Publisher, and lastly, us.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-001#16:1>
As such, all these multiple layerings and manipulation makes us
question the authenticity of the story, as much as Gulliver claims it to be
true.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-001#17:1>
This opening atmosphere of unreliability is perpetuated throughout
the novel by Gulliver himself.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-001#18:1>
Gulliver is very prone to exaggeration.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-001#19:1>
For example, in Book I, he said this of the Lilliputians.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-001#20:1>
" I confess I was often tempted, while they were passing backwards
and forwards on my Body to seize Forty of Fifty of the first that came in my
Reach, and dash them against the Ground." This is an instance of exaggeration
because at that point of time, Gulliver had only one hand free.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-001#21:1>
Perhaps, seizing ten or twenty would be a more reasonable claim, than
Forty or Fifty.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-001#22:1>
Hence, Gulliver's tendency to exaggerate makes him a less reliable
narrator.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-001#23:1>
Gulliver's state of mind is also one of the factors that makes him an
unreliable narrator.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-001#24:1>
The first example, is at the end of Book II after his escape from
Brobdingnag.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-001#25:1>
By then, Gulliver had totally lost his sense of perspective.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-001#26:1>
He told the rescue crew, " let one of the crew put his finger into
the Ring, and take the Box out of the sea into the ship, and so into the
Captain's Cabin." And " I was equally confounded at the Sight of so many
Pignies; for such I took them to be, after having so long accustomed my eyes
to the monstrous objects I had left."

<ICE-SIN:W1A-001#27:1>
Everyone, including his family, though he had gone mad.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-001#28:1>
Indeed, when the narrator loses his perspective or mind, we as
readers are also de-stabilised.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-001#29:1>
Hence, Gulliver's unreliability distorts our views too.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-001#30:1>
Another instance of Gulliver losing his mind, is at the end of the
novel.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-001#31:1>
After spending some time in Houyhnhnmland he becomes absolutely
irrational.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-001#32:1>
He said, " But I must freely confess, that the many virtues of those
excellent Quadrupeds placed in opposite view to human corruptions, had so far
opened my Eyes, and enlarged my understanding, that I began to view the
Actions and Passion of man in a very different light;"

<ICE-SIN:W1A-001#33:1>
" In a very different light" indeed!

<ICE-SIN:W1A-001#34:1>
For he acts and behaves in a most ridiculous manner.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-001#35:1>
y " rational ideals and rejects the company of man.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-001#36:1>
Even the sight of his beloved family makes him sick.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-001#37:1>
By this time, Gulliver is totally unreliable as a narrator because he
is now irrational and we just cannot accept his views.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-001#38:1>
Because the narrator himself is disoriented, our views are inevitably
distorted by his madness.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-001#39:1>
Also, on the grounds that since Swift the author is different from
Gulliver, the narrator, one can already say that the narrator would
inevitably be unreliable.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-001#40:1>
This especially so as Swift satirises Gulliver in the story.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-001#41:1>
Therefore, Gulliver's account of his experiences and responses will
always be regarded by readers with a certain amount of disbelief and
suspicions.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-001#42:1>
As for Rasselas, the role of the narrator is sometimes played by the
characters themselves but more often by an unseen narrator.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-001#43:1>
By the use of an unseen narrator, the way we see the story is
inevitably dictated.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-001#44:1>
This is because this unseen narrator is an all-knowing type.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-001#45:1>
And in this sense, we are at his " mercy" for he does not give us
alternatives.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-001#46:1>
For example, in Chapter 1, after describing Happy Valley, he said, "
Such was the appearance of security and delight which this retirement
afforded, that they to whom it was new always desired that it might be
perpetual; and as those, on whom the iron gate had once closed, were never
suffered to return, the effect of longer experience could not be known."
Therefore, we are forced to accept what he says because he is " all-knowing".

<ICE-SIN:W1A-001#47:1>
Whether or not what he says is true is something that we cannot
question, because there are no other options.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-001#48:1>
Unlike in Gulliver's Travels, where the narrator is a character, we
can at least question the reliability of his account.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-001#49:1>
But here is Rasselas, this is denied of us and as such, we are
dictated by the narrator.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-001#50:1>
One of this narrator's techniques is to cushion the harsh reality
that occurs.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-001#51:1>
He does not present the facts as it occurs but rather, he cushions
it.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-001#52:1>
That is, serious issues would be turned by his narrative style, into "
light-hearted" comedy.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-001#53:1>
For example, the narrator transforms the seriousness of the
astronomer's self-deception into comedy.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-001#54:1>
He allows the astronomer to say, " One day as I was looking on the
fields withering with heat, I felt in my mind a sudden wish that I could send
rain on the southern mountains,....In the hurry of my imagination I commanded
rain to fall,....I found that the clouds had listened to my lips."

<ICE-SIN:W1A-001#55:1>
By doing so, he is inevitably controlling our responses to the story
by emphasising on the morals to be learnt, rather than the harshness of the
situation.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-001#56:1>
This is also seen in the way the narrator chooses to hint and imply
his morals, rather than by overtly stating it.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-001#57:1>
For example, after Rasselas discovered the hypocrisy of the " wise
and happy man", he said,

<ICE-SIN:W1A-001#58:1>
" The prince, went away convinced of the emptiness of rhetorical
sound, and the inefficacy of polished periods and studied sentences." By
allowing Rasselas to say this himself after the experience he went through,
it subtly reinforces the moral of this situation.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-001#59:1>
By using such a means, the narrator subtly controls and dictates our
attitude towards the story.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-001#60:1>
At times, the narrator allows the characters to speak for themselves.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-001#61:1>
But even this is ultimately controlled by him for his " heavy"
presence is still felt because he sometimes intrudes and makes comments.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-001#62:1>
Or sometimes, he would already have set up the framework or
background, in which the characters speak, whereby our views and attitudes
are ultimately controlled.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-001#63:1>
Therefore, Gulliver is an unreliable narrator, because his sanity is
questionable and because he is a character being satirised in the story, his
account is therefore even more subjective.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-001#64:1>
As such, it distorts our views.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-001#65:1>
As for Rasselas, the narrator is a dictator for he controls and
dictates how we should see the characters and the incidents.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-001#66:1>
But it is not necessarily a means of distortion.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-001#67:1>
For this unseen narrator is at least closer to Johnson than Gulliver
the narrator is to Swift. </I>

<ICE-SIN:W1A-001#68:2>
Q: Would you agree that it is possible for each reader to interpret
who is the hero of Paradise Lost according to his or her predilections?

<ICE-SIN:W1A-001#69:2>
A: Paradise Lost is an epic poem based on Christianity.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-001#70:2>
And one does not need to know a lot about Christianity in order to
know that God represents goodness, while Satan, evil, and therefore,
everything bad.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-001#71:2>
In fact this is a basic assumption that one has even before reading
the poem.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-001#72:2>
However, in Paradise Lost this basic assumption is brought to
question.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-001#73:2>
This is not to say that Paradise Lost depicts God as bad.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-001#74:2>
On the contrary, the goodness of God is never in question.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-001#75:2>
It is in the character Satan that all our prior assumptions are
shaken.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-001#76:2>
As much as we know that Satan is evil, Milton's portrayal of him is
such that he emerges as a hero in his own right.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-001#77:2>
In the beginning of Paradise Lost it is Satan that we see.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-001#78:2>
Milton took pains to describe Satan and his fall.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-001#79:2>
We are never allowed to forget that what Satan had done was
essentially wrong.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-001#80:2>
But yet, it is inevitable from the portrayal that we feel closer to
Satan and Hell at this point.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-001#81:2>
God in Heaven seems so far away.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-001#82:2>
With the emphasis placed on Satan right from the beginning, Milton
describes Satan's stature.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-001#83:2>
He wrote, <X> <quote>

<ICE-SIN:W1A-001#X84:2>
" he, above the rest In shape and gesture proudly eminent, Stood
like a tower; his form had yet not lost All her original brightness,"
</quote> </X>

<ICE-SIN:W1A-001#85:2>
Therefore there is a quality of grandeur and heroism in Satan's
stature, which cannot be denied.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-001#86:2>
Milton also described Satan in terms of " dauntless courage".

<ICE-SIN:W1A-001#87:2>
And justice is done to this description when we see Satan
volunteering himself for the difficult task of searching the truth of the
prophecy.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-001#88:2>
None of the other devils would dare to undertake this task.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-001#89:2>
Milton described them, <X> <quote>

<ICE-SIN:W1A-001#X90:2>
" but all sat mute, Pondering the danger with deep thoughts;"
</quote> </X>

<ICE-SIN:W1A-001#91:2>
Except Satan, <X> <quote>

<ICE-SIN:W1A-001#X92:2>
" Whom now transcendent glory raised Above his fellows, with
monarchal pride, conscious of highest worth," </quote> </X>

<ICE-SIN:W1A-001#93:2>
He alone dared to undertake " the dreadful voyage" and deserves the
description of " dauntless courage".

<ICE-SIN:W1A-001#94:2>
Hence there is indeed a heroic quality about him.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-001#95:2>
And what makes Satan even more heroic is that he is the only figure
in Paradise Lost in whom we see in full the struggle that he undergoes and
the strength that arises from this conflict.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-001#96:2>
In Book Four Satan talks about his own struggle - - what he had lost.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-001#97:2>
He said, <X> <quote>

<ICE-SIN:W1A-001#X98:2>
" O Sun, to tell thee how I hate thy beams, That bring to my
remembrance from what state I fell, How glorious once above thy sphere; Till
pride and worse ambition threw me down, warring in heav'n against heav'n's
matchless King." </quote> </X>

<ICE-SIN:W1A-001#99:2>
But after deliberating about what he had done and what he had lost,
he stoically said, <X> <quote>

<ICE-SIN:W1A-001#X100:2>
" So farewell hope, and with hope farewell fear, Farewell remorse:
all good to me is lost; Evil, be thou my good;" </quote> </X>

<ICE-SIN:W1A-001#101:2>
As much as we know that Satan has sinned and is therefore in the
wrong, he still emerges as a hero.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-001#102:2>
For the struggle that we see him undergoing is presented with a
sense of realism.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-001#103:2>
That is, we identify with his struggle and we sympathise him.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-001#104:2>
On top of that, it is through this conflict that Satan's strength
and power is shown.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-001#105:2>
He wins our sympathy and, more importantly, our admiration, when he
courageously faces his struggle, knowing well that the odds are against him.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-001#106:2>
On the other hand, God is portrayed as a tyrant.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-001#107:2>
He commands his angels to adore Him.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-001#108:2>
He said, " Adore the Son, and honor him as me." Thereafter, the
angels worship Him.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-001#109:2>
But as for Satan, he earns the respect and praise from his cohorts.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-001#110:2>
Therefore Milton's portrayal of Satan certainly makes him an
impressive figure.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-001#111:2>
And it is not difficult for one to interpret him as the hero of
Paradise Lost even though we are constantly reminded of his wrongdoings.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-001#112:2>
It is precisely this that makes him all the more attractive.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-001#113:2>
For he is the only character in the poem, unlike God and the Son,
who earns his heroic stature.

<ICE-SIN:W1A-001#114:2>
It may seem ironical that Milton should choose to portray Satan
instead of Christ in a heroic light. <X>

<ICE-SIN:W1A-001#X115:2>
But in Milton's Paradise Lost everything begins with God, even
Satan acknowledges God as " Heav'n's matchless King".

<ICE-SIN:W1A-001#X116:2>
Perhaps in choosing to give Satan a heroic stature, Milton is using
Satan's pride and rebellion to illuminate the enigmatic question of free
will. </X> </I>
