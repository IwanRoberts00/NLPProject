<ICE-SIN:W2F-008#3:1>
" Do you regret it?" Wen Ei asked.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-008#4:1>
Grace didn't answer.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-008#5:1>
She was standing in the middle of the large hall, turning slowly to
look at each wall in turn.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-008#6:1>
Wen Ei knew Grace well enough to realise that she was planning,
designing, plotting exactly what would be done and how it would be done.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-008#7:1>
It was a long room.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-008#8:1>
One end opened to the purple bougainvillea-shadowed balcony, while the
other led to the passage which ran alongside the 'sky-well' to the kitchen.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-008#9:1>
We can have barbecues in the sky-well, Wen Ei had said excitedly when
she saw this.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-008#10:1>
Two bed-rooms opened off the hall, facing a wall of windows, casually
barred in with sturdy metal that was beginning to rust.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-008#11:1>
One bedroom was empty except for the thick dust on the floor.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-008#12:1>
The other contained an incredibly high, hard bed and a row of dark
wood cupboards with doors that wouldn't open.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-008#13:1>
" No," said Grace, long after Wen Ei had given up expecting a reply,
" No, I don't regret it at all.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-008#14:1>
It's a wonderful house.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-008#15:1>
We were meant to be here."

<ICE-SIN:W2F-008#16:1>
" They had been talking about buying a place together for a long
time, ever since coming back from America.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-008#17:1>
Why had they put it off till now?

<ICE-SIN:W2F-008#18:1>
Too much of a commitment?

<ICE-SIN:W2F-008#19:1>
A commitment to keeping their jobs, to seeing through the mortgage,
to staying in Singapore...

<ICE-SIN:W2F-008#20:1>
or was it just a matter of waiting for the right house?

<ICE-SIN:W2F-008#21:1>
Wen Ei had been ready to put her money down on the first place that
they saw.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-008#22:1>
This had been a compact little flat in Clementi.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-008#23:1>
Wen Ei had been sure that it could be done up.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-008#24:1>
Wen Ei was always working up enthusiasm for the most unsuitable
things.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-008#25:1>
In retrospect, the Clementi flat was much too small and had a front
door that opened onto the garbage pickup point.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-008#26:1>
It would have had bad feng shui.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-008#27:1>
Grace was not superstitious about feng shui, but she was particular.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-008#28:1>
Grace didn't mind living in a rented flat, but she was reluctant to
put her money in one.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-008#29:1>
If she was to be a property owner, she wanted to own land; land that
she was responsible for, that she could dig and plant sensible things in,
even if it was only pandan leaves or tapioca.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-008#30:1>
Grace was very practical and the money she inherited from her
grandparents allowed her the luxury of being practical.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-008#31:1>
She wanted to be able to tear down her house and live in a tent if
she wanted to.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-008#32:1>
To rebuild on her land.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-008#33:1>
Sure, your strata title established your claim to your cube of
apartment air-space, but up there you were surrounded by air-space that
belonged to other people.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-008#34:1>
Wen Ei, having lived all her conscious years in an HDB flat before
going to Michigan, didn't find it disturbing to be surrounded by other
people's air-space.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-008#35:1>
She liked the apartment they rented in St Thomas Walk, and she hadn't
been in any hurry to move even if she did want to buy every apartment they
saw.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-008#36:1>
Wen Ei could probably have spent the rest of her life in St Thomas
Walk quite contentedly.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-008#37:1>
After all, Grace paid most of the rent.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-008#38:1>
But then they found this house.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-008#39:1>
It was almost as though it had been waiting for them even before they
knew they were looking for it.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-008#40:1>
The house was set almost at the top of a long, upward-winding road,
and behind the house the slope continued into restless trees which grew tall
out of a tangle of luxuriant undergrowth.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-008#41:1>
There were birds, there were butterflies, the air smelt of damp earth
and happy kampong childhood and an Indian neighbour who was airing her two
beautiful Eurasian babies told them that at times monkeys came out of the 'jungle'
to play in the gardens, especially when you had ripe mangoes and papayas.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-008#42:1>
" Monkeys in the garden," Wen Ei said rapturously, picturing postcard
sweet chimpanzees.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-008#43:1>
" They're probably vicious.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-008#44:1>
And she said that snakes come up in the rainy season,"

<ICE-SIN:W2F-008#45:1>
" But monkeys," said Wen Ei dreamily.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-008#46:1>
Of course they bought the house.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-008#47:1>
Grace took two weeks leave following the move.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-008#48:1>
Wen Ei said she wanted to do the same, but with SBC's tenth
anniversary coming up, it was impossible.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-008#49:1>
In any case, Wen Ei wasn't too interested in things like cleaning and
clearing.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-008#50:1>
So Grace set out to tackle that alone.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-008#51:1>
Grace started in the bedroom they were going to turn into a study.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-008#52:1>
" It's so strange," Grace told Wen Ei that night, " I kept feeling
that someone was watching me'.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-008#53:1>
It's such a small, stuffy room.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-008#54:1>
We'll have to clear the bushes outside the window to let more light
in, and I think it could do with some extra wiring.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-008#55:1>
And we'll have to get rid of the cupboards and the bed.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-008#56:1>
You know, it's so weird, I kept thinking someone was lying on the bed
watching me."

<ICE-SIN:W2F-008#57:1>
" Maybe we should get you a radio to keep you company," Wen Ei
suggested, thinking about car-pets and pictures and spot lighting.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-008#58:1>
" You know, I thought I actually saw someone there?

<ICE-SIN:W2F-008#59:1>
On the bed."

<ICE-SIN:W2F-008#60:1>
" Who?"

<ICE-SIN:W2F-008#61:1>
" I don't know.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-008#62:1>
At first I thought a very old woman.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-008#63:1>
Lying back, you know...because of the shadows.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-008#64:1>
In a sort of flowered thing.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-008#65:1>
Then I thought it wasn't a woman at all; it was an enormous cat."

<ICE-SIN:W2F-008#66:1>
" You mean like a lion or a tiger?"

<ICE-SIN:W2F-008#67:1>
" No, if I meant a lion or a tiger I would have said so.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-008#68:1>
It was a cat, a pussy cat, only really enormous, you know." Wen Ei
didn't know.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-008#69:1>
She wasn't very interested and felt that Grace wasn't paying
attention to her plans.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-008#70:1>
They could get a dog, she thought.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-008#71:1>
Now they had a garden and there was room enough for a dog to run
about, they could get a dog.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-008#72:1>
It would have to be bathed and walked, but Grace would probably enjoy
doing that.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-008#73:1>
" Let's get a dog."

<ICE-SIN:W2F-008#74:1>
" No!"

<ICE-SIN:W2F-008#75:1>
For a moment, Grace's face was livid with anger.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-008#76:1>
Wen Ei hadn't realised Grace was so dead set against dogs.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-008#77:1>
It was very unfair of Grace not to have told her.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-008#78:1>
Wen Ei started to cry, but for once Grace didn't come over to soothe
her and promise her everything she wanted.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-008#79:1>
Instead Grace went back into the bedroom wearily to continue cleaning
it out.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-008#80:1>
Perhaps, Wen Ei thought, Grace was allergic to dust and it affected
her in this way.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-008#81:1>
Wen Ei stopped crying since no one was paying attention to her.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-008#82:1>
She thought she was generous to put up with Grace until all the
moving in problems were sorted out.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-008#83:1>
Which seemed to be taking a long time.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-008#84:1>
" Why is it taking so long?" " Why is what taking so long?"

<ICE-SIN:W2F-008#85:1>
" I mean, it's just cleaning, right?"

<ICE-SIN:W2F-008#86:1>
" There are so many cupboards," Grace said vaguely.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-008#87:1>
" Why don't you just focus on cleaning the windows and floors and
walls.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-008#88:1>
If we're going to throw out the cupboards anyway, there's no point
cleaning them up first, right?"

<ICE-SIN:W2F-008#89:1>
" I don't know, I think we should keep them.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-008#90:1>
They're beautiful pieces.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-008#91:1>
You don't get wooden furniture like that any more."

<ICE-SIN:W2F-008#92:1>
" Personally, I think I'd prefer something a bit more modern," Wen Ei
said.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-008#93:1>
Grace didn't answer.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-008#94:1>
As though she didn't exist, Wen Ei thought grumpily.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-008#95:1>
Her mind ran through all the men who had wanted to marry her.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-008#96:1>
It was one of her mind's favourite occupations.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-008#97:1>
Usually she did it out loud, but the probability that Grace would
ignore her made this a pointless exercise.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-008#98:1>
Grace was sitting on the floor in front of a solid looking cupboard.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-008#99:1>
It was both solid and unyield - both solid and unyielding.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-008#100:1>
There was a fold-out cabinet above, three drawers, and then another
fold-out cabinet below.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-008#101:1>
It was this second fold-out cupboard that Grace was working on.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-008#102:1>
The doors were jammed and Grace was trying to ease them open.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-008#103:1>
" Just force it," Wen Ei said.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-008#104:1>
Grace didn't answer.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-008#105:1>
Wen Ei was hurt.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-008#106:1>
After all, she had been trying to be helpful and it was very
magnanimous of her to try after the way Grace had treated her.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-008#107:1>
But Grace didn't even acknowledge this.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-008#108:1>
" Was anything inside any of the other cup-boards?"

<ICE-SIN:W2F-008#109:1>
" No."

<ICE-SIN:W2F-008#110:1>
" Then there's probably nothing inside here either.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-008#111:1>
Just leave it.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-008#112:1>
You look so tired already, poor thing.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-008#113:1>
Come and have a bath and go straight to bed.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-008#114:1>
We can finish up tomorrow."

<ICE-SIN:W2F-008#115:1>
" If you slip your hand in at the top while I'm holding the doors
open like that, maybe you can see if you can find the catch."

<ICE-SIN:W2F-008#116:1>
Obediently, Wen Ei put her hand into the dark triangle.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-008#117:1>
It felt horribly dirty and it suddenly struck her that something
inside the unpleasant darkness of the cupboard was going to reach out and
slash its fangs through her vulnerable hand.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-008#118:1>
She slid her fingers down where the two doors met in front.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-008#119:1>
" There's a metal loop on each door, and some-thing through them."

<ICE-SIN:W2F-008#120:1>
" See if you can slide it out." Wen Ei pinched the cylindrical
object between her index finger and middle finger and slid it out.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-008#121:1>
The doors opened out under Grace's hands.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-008#122:1>
Wen Ei looked at the object in her hand.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-008#123:1>
It was a Chinese pen, but a strange one; its body was thicker than
Wen Ei's thumb and it was patterned all over with inked-in scratches.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-008#124:1>
Inside the cupboard there was only an old book.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-008#125:1>
Grace lifted it out.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-008#126:1>
Its pages were yellow with age and as thin and powdery as moth
wings.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-008#127:1>
Grace blew on it.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-008#128:1>
The cover was missing, but it was clear but it was clear that it was
some sort of a translating dictionary.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-008#129:1>
One of the languages was Chinese, but they couldn't tell what the
other language was.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-008#130:1>
It seemed more a series of coded symbols than a language.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-008#131:1>
There were actually pictures and diagrams.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-008#132:1>
The squat book sat comfortably in Grace's lap but somehow made her
feel uncomfortable.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-008#133:1>
Again, and even more strongly, she felt that there was someone
watching her.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-008#134:1>
When she turned to look, the bed ( like the cupboard) was bare, ( as
she had expected it to be) - but it was the bareness of anticipation.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-008#135:1>
" Do you think this is writing?"

<ICE-SIN:W2F-008#136:1>
Wen Ei passed her the Chinese pen and took the book.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-008#137:1>
" I wonder if this is worth anything.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-008#138:1>
It looks like it's really old."

<ICE-SIN:W2F-008#139:1>
The scratches on the pen matched the scratches in the book, Grace
saw.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-008#140:1>
But it was strange to her how the pen felt safe and comforting while
the book felt full of a dangerous, latent power.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-008#141:1>
Grace closed her fingers around the pen.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-008#142:1>
It comforted her.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-008#143:1>
Wen Ei turned the pages of the book, delicately, between two careful
fingers.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-008#144:1>
Wen Ei had beautiful fingers, long and tapered, like those of
ancient courtesans whose only duty is to sing for emperors.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-008#145:1>
Wen Ei would have been a perfect, pampered courtesan.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-008#146:1>
Unfortunately for her she had been born too late into an age that
expected women to take responsibility for their own lives.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-008#147:1>
With her slender fingers, Wen Ei turned the ancient pages which no
emperors had looked into, but which had been consulted to shape the destiny
and deaths of emperors.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-008#148:1>
Wen Ei read aloud from the book, making out the Chinese symbols
which made no sense to her as she sounded them.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-008#149:1>
But the thick pen danced in Grace's grasp, struggling towards the
girl beside her, as though to stab her through.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-008#150:1>
Grace held it, and it transferred the desire to her, the desire to
rip itself through Wen Ei's throat and shred the pages of the book she held.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-008#151:1>
But a movement behind them arrested all other movement in the room.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-008#152:1>
As Wen Ei spoke the words she did not understand, darkness had
collected from different parts of the room.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-008#153:1>
Darkness that had been banished into different parts of different
cupboards in different rooms of the house and bound there by charms.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-008#154:1>
Stray darkness that hadscattered and escaped the binding. <X>

<ICE-SIN:W2F-008#X155:1>
The darkness collected itself on the bed, but it was not yet whole.

<ICE-SIN:W2F-008#X156:1>
It was still a shadow without substance, the shadow of an old, old
woman; or, if you looked again, the shadow of an enormous, malevolent cat.
