Dear CPF Member,

<ICE-SIN:W1B-030#2:1>
Every month part of your CPF goes into your Medisave Account which can
be used to pay hospital bills or buy a CPF medical insurance called
MediShield.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-030#3:1>
From July 1994, CPF members have yet another choice of medical
insurance, that is MediShield Plus.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-030#4:1>
<h> WHAT IS MEDISHIELD & MEDISHIELD PLUS? </h>

<ICE-SIN:W1B-030#5:1>
MediShield is a low-cost medical insurance that helps a CPF member and
his dependants pay their hospital bills if they exceed a certain amount.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-030#6:1>
For most cases, together with Medisave, it should be enough to help a
CPF member pay the Class C or Class B2 hospital bills incurred in a
Government or Restructured hospital.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-030#7:1>
MediShield Plus works just like MediShield except that it pays out
more.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-030#8:1>
It is particularly helpful to those who choose to use the more
expensive Class B1 and Class A wards.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-030#9:1>
But they will need to pay a higher premium for the higher insurance
cover.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-030#10:1>
<h> HOW TO JOIN MEDISHIELD OF MEDISHIELD PLUS? </h>

<ICE-SIN:W1B-030#11:1>
A CPF member may join either MediShield of MediShield Plus, but not
both.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-030#12:1>
Therefore, if you wish to join : -

<ICE-SIN:W1B-030#13:1>
MediShield, just keep the enclosed MediShield certificate and we will
insure you on the date indicated.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-030#14:1>
MediShield Plus, please complete the enclosed application form ( Form
MSH/F1) and return it to us.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-030#15:1>
If you do not wish to join MediShield or MediShield Plus, please sign
the lower portion of the enclosed MediShield Certificate and return it to us
before the date indicated there.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-030#16:1>
If you are also insuring your dependants under MediShield or
MediShield Plus, please complete the relevant section of the enclosed form as
well.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-030#17:1>
You may use your Medisave to pay their premiums.

insurance scheme, provides financial protection to about 1.3 million CPF
