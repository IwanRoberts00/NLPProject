<ICE-SIN:W2C-013#3:1>
MAJOR international drug smugglers are avoiding using Singapore as a
transit station following the arrests of many of their couriers here.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-013#4:1>
Increased pressure by the Central Narcotics Bureau ( CNB) and the
sharing of intelligence with other countries in the region have forced these
syndicates to alter their smuggling routes.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-013#5:1>
Previously, couriers flew from Thailand to Singapore, and then caught
connecting flights to final destinations in Europe and the United States.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-013#6:1>
Now, couriers moving out of the Golden Triangle - the main
poppy-growing region which borders Thailand, Myanmar and Laos - travel
eastward, across China to Hongkong, or west to India and Sri Lanka, for their
connecting flights, according to foreign anti-narcotics agencies.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-013#7:1>
The syndicates have altered their methods of smuggling drugs into
Singapore frequently, but better surveillance and advanced detection
equipment have continually foiled attempts to bring the drugs here, forcing
them to change their smuggling circuits.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-013#8:1>
CNB officers have noted with satisfaction that two major syndicates
using Nigerian and Hongkong runners seem to have stopped coming through
Singapore.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-013#9:1>
In 1991, the CNB smashed several Nigerian operations, while the last
time a Hongkong trafficker was detected here was in July last year.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-013#10:1>
The change in couriers' routes has resulted in a fall in the number
of big-time traffickers facing the death penalty here - from a high of 88 in
1991 to 72 last year.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-013#11:1>
CNB chief Sim Poh Heng said that its revamped intelligence system and
better co-ordination between the CNB and its counterparts in other countries
have also resulted in record heroin seizures, which amounted to 60.5 kg last
year - up from just 10 kg six years ago.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-013#12:1>
As of May 31, 94 of the 372 traffickers who are facing the death
penalty have been sentenced to death.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-013#13:1>
Forty of them have been executed.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-013#14:1>
The authorities are also paying more attention to drugs smuggled in
by sea.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-013#15:1>
Although there have been just a handful of cases where drugs were
found hidden on fishing trawlers, Mr Sim said that the Police Coast Guard,
with its faster boats and better radar, will continue to tighten the screws
on drug smugglers at sea. </I>

THE STRAITS TIMES, FRIDAY, JUNE 18, 1993

<ICE-SIN:W2C-013#17:2>
<h> Jail,
&dollar;50,000 fine for running illegal billiard saloons </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2C-013#18:2>
<h> Students found there will be arrested too </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2C-013#19:2>
By David Miller

<ICE-SIN:W2C-013#20:2>
ILLEGAL billiard saloon operators could find themselves behind bars
or facing stiffer fines following a decision by the Attorney General's
Chambers to charge them under a different law.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-013#21:2>
The decision to use the Common Gaming Houses Act which carries a jail
term of up to five years and a maximum fine of
&dollar;50,000, will put more bite into police enforcement.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-013#22:2>
The decision also means that patrons, including students, found
gambling in such dens could also, for the first time, be hauled to court.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-013#23:2>
The Act has a presumption which states that any person found in a
common gaming house shall be deemed to have been gaming unless he can prove
otherwise.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-013#24:2>
Superintendent Ng Kee Hoe, the Commander of Central Police Division
who first mooted the idea said: " This Act will definitely have a more
deterrent effect on operators.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-013#25:2>
" We also want to issue a stern warning to students during their
current vacation, that if they are found gambling in these saloons, they are
liable to be arrested." Operators of illegal saloons were previously charged
under the Public Entertainment Act which carries a maximum fine of just
&dollar;5,000. 

<ICE-SIN:W2C-013#26:2>
But bearing in mind the highly lucrative nature of the
illegal business, operators had no trouble settling the fine.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-013#27:2>
More than 100 raids by the police in the past two years hardly made a
dent in this mushrooming gambling business which was attracting students in
greater numbers.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-013#28:2>
Many dens hit by the authorities who confiscated their equipment,
were back in business within a week.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-013#29:2>
This prompted Supt Ng to propose to the Attorney General's Chambers
last month that the Common Gaming Houses Act should be invoked to deal with
the problem.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-013#30:2>
The Attorney-General gave the go-ahead last week, Supt Ng told The
Straits Times.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-013#31:2>
" This Act will definitely have a greater deterrent effect on
operators," said Supt Ng, who warned that the police will continue to
crackdown on these saloons.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-013#32:2>
" We will not stop until this menace has been cleaned up." </I>

<h> Girl, 16, among 46 nabbed in massive drug blitz </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2C-013#34:3>
<h> Death for youngest suspect if convicted </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2C-013#35:3>
By David Miller

<ICE-SIN:W2C-013#36:3>
A 16-YEAR-OLD girl - the youngest suspect to be arrested for drug
trafficking here - was among 46 Singaporeans nabbed in a series of raids that
began on Wednesday.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-013#37:3>
The unemployed girl will be charged as an adult and, like five other
men who were arrested in the raids, will face the mandatory death penalty if
convicted.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-013#38:3>
The blitz, codenamed Operation Potato, was the largest in terms of
suspects arrested.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-013#39:3>
It netted 2 kg of heroin with a street value of about
&dollar;800,000. 

<ICE-SIN:W2C-013#40:3>
This was the second major drug syndicate to be smashed by
the Central Narcotics Bureau ( CNB) in the past two months.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-013#41:3>
Last month, CNB officers arrested 18 Singaporeans and seized heroin
worth
&dollar;200,000 in a crackdown codenamed Operation Tanah Merah.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-013#42:3>
Mr Masbollah Fazal, CNB's deputy director, said his men had worked on
the latest case for about two months after receiving information that a local
supplier was smuggling between 2 kg and 4 kg of heroin each week from across
the Causeway.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-013#43:3>
The drug was sold quickly to a few major distributors who then
repacked it into small sachets to be sold to pushers and addicts.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-013#44:3>
According to the CNB, the supplier, a 31-year-old unemployed man,
used pagers and handphones to contact his distributors.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-013#45:3>
He was very cautious when setting up meetings and normally met a
distributor at a pre-arranged spot, but not before keeping close surveillance
to ensure that he was not walking into a trap.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-013#46:3>
He even planned multiple escape routes.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-013#47:3>
Each transaction, lasting only a matter of minutes, took place in his
car, a white Honda Accord, while he was driving so that he could check easily
if he was being followed.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-013#48:3>
Both parties left in different directions immediately after the sale
was completed.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-013#49:3>
The CNB moved in at about 4.30 pm on Wednesday when the supplier was
seen picking up a known distributor, an unemployed 35-year-old man, at
Saujana Road in Bukit Panjang.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-013#50:3>
Using various teams, CNB officers trailed the car, which later
stopped at Jalan Lokam off Upper Paya Lebar Road.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-013#51:3>
When the suspected distributor alighted from the car, the officers
moved in.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-013#52:3>
Both men put up a violent struggle, but were subdued and arrested.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-013#53:3>
A packet of heroin weighing 442 g was found in the distributor's
pocket, while
&dollar;2,600 - proceeds from the drug sale - was found on the supplier.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-013#54:3>
The distributor's rented room in a house along the same road was
raided.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-013#55:3>
Three men in their 20s and the 16-year-old girl were arrested.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-013#56:3>
The four were apparently packing heroin weighing 301 g into 43
smaller sachets when they were caught.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-013#57:3>
The supplier's flat in Hougang was also raided, and 352 g of heroin
was seized.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-013#58:3>
The man led CNB officers to a flat in Saujana Road later that night,
where another 884g of heroin was found.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-013#59:3>
Once the main suspects were picked up, the CNB launched a massive
island-wide sweep to weed out the rest of the syndicate's members.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-013#60:3>
From midnight to 6 am yesterday, 40 suspects, including three women,
were arrested.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-013#61:3>
More heroin and 11 packets of opium were confiscated.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-013#62:3>
In all,
&dollar;12,150 in cash was seized.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-013#63:3>
Mr Masbollah said that 26 of the 40 suspects picked up in the later
raids tested positive for drug consumption and would be sent for
rehabilitation.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-013#64:3>
He said that some of them may be charged with drug possession after
they are discharged from the rehabilitation centre.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-013#65:3>
As a result of the latest raids, " addicts are going to find it more
difficult to get their hands on the drugs", he added.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-013#66:3>
" For our part, we are going to do our best to keep the pressure up
to stop any new syndicates from setting up shop here".

<ICE-SIN:W2C-013#67:3>
<h> Seized: Radio scanner that intercepts signals </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2C-013#68:3>
A RADIO scanner ( right), capable of intercepting signals from
handphones, walkie-talkies and possibly even frequencies used by the police
and the Central Narcotics Bureau ( CNB), was seized in Wednesday's drug
crackdown.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-013#69:3>
This is another indication to the authorities that drug syndicates in
Singapore are using more sophisticated equipment.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-013#70:3>
In December last year, the CNB seized a laptop computer that was used
by another suspected trafficker to check his distribution network.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-013#71:3>
CNB's deputy director, Mr Masbollah Fazal, said the scanner was used
probably to monitor transmissions which could alert syndicate members to an
impending raid by the authorities.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-013#72:3>
He said the scanner had yet to be checked to see if it could tune in
to police or the CNB's radio frequencies.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-013#73:3>
In the past few years, more drug suspects had been using handphones
and pagers to set up deals.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-013#74:3>
Seized pagers have been known to provide the authorities with vital
clues.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-013#75:3>
During yesterday's press briefing on the drug bust, a few of the six
seized pagers kept beeping.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-013#76:3>
Said Mr Masbollah: " We will have to check these numbers.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-013#77:3>
We could expect more arrests to be made soon." Two main challenges
for CNB in fight against drug abuse </I>

<I>

<ICE-SIN:W2C-013#78:4>
<h> Curbing relapse rate </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2C-013#79:4>
<h> Beefing up prevention programme </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2C-013#80:4>
by David Miller

<ICE-SIN:W2C-013#81:4>
THE two main challenges facing the Central Narcotics Bureau ( CNB)
will be to curb the high number of relapse cases among hardcore drug addicts
and to look into ways to beef up its drug prevention programme.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-013#82:4>
The CNB's director, Mr Sim Poh Heng, made these points while giving
an overview of the drug situation in Singapore.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-013#83:4>
Although the relapse rate fell for the second successive year, it was
still high at 70.3 per cent for 1992 - down from its peak of 78.1 per cent
three years ago.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-013#84:4>
The CNB, together with the Prisons Department, which runs the
rehabilitation programme, will be discussing ways to make the detoxification
programme more effective, particularly for those who have gone through it
three or more times but have not been able to break the habit.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-013#85:4>
" The problem of hardcore addicts must be resolved in order to
improve the drug situation," stressed Mr Sim, who declined to give further
details as plans are still being worked out.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-013#86:4>
The CNB is also looking at ways to revamp its drug prevention
programme, to ensure that it leaves a lasting impression on the target group.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-013#87:4>
Most drug addicts here fall within the 20 to 39 age group.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-013#88:4>
Many are school dropouts and are either unemployed or holding
blue-collar jobs.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-013#89:4>
On the current drug scene the CNB said that its constant pressure had
eradicated " black areas" - - places where drugs are bought and used openly.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-013#90:4>
It also said that although the number of drug addicts is believed to
have risen marginally last year, this is not a cause for concern.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-013#91:4>
" The drug situation is well under control and will continue to be so
as long as we do not become complacent about it, said Mr Sim.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-013#92:4>
He said the CNB's simple strategy of tackling the problem of drug
abuse from both the demand and supply fronts has been effective.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-013#93:4>
" In order to reduce the supply, we hit very hard at drug suppliers,
from small-time street-pushers and distributors to big-time syndicate
leaders," he said.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-013#94:4>
Last May, in the largest operation in CNB history, 37 suspects were
nabbed and heroin with a local street value of about
&dollar;6 million was seized in a blitz codenamed Operation Monopoly.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-013#95:4>
One reason why drug suppliers continue to try to penetrate the local
drug market is the erroneous perception that there is a large market for the
contraband here because of the higher prices it commands.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-013#96:4>
The Woodlands checkpoint remains the main avenue for traffickers to
smuggle in drugs meant for local consumption in Singapore.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-013#97:4>
" Drug traffickers are aware that detection is hampered by the high
volume of traffic, and they take advantage of this. <X>

<ICE-SIN:W2C-013#X98:4>
" We have,therefore stepped up our operations at the Woodlands
Checkpoint and introduced other features like high-tech equipment and
narcotic dogs," said Mr Sim.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-013#X99:4>
He said that for security reasons, he could not elaborate on the new
equipment.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-013#X100:4>
On the demand side, the CNB arrested a record 5,600 local addicts
last year - up from 4,425 in 1991.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-013#X101:4>
One area of particular concern for the bureau is the increasing
number of intravenous drug abusers, whose numbers shot up from 23 in 1989 to
238 last year.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-013#X102:4>
While their proportion is still small compared with the total
number of addicts arrested, the CNB is monitoring the situation closely.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-013#X103:4>
The bureau's concern is understandable.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-013#X104:4>
Apart from the higher chance of an overdose, intravenous abusers
using shared needles also run the risk of infection and contracting diseases
such as malaria, hepatitis B and Aids.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-013#X105:4>
So far, five people have contracted Aids through intravenous drug
abuse.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-013#X106:4>
The CNB attributed the rise in the number of such addicts to the
influence of foreign drug abusers, who use needles to administer the drug
directly into the bloodstream for a faster and harder " kick" compared with
inhaling heroin fumes - or " chasing the dragon" - the method favoured by
local addicts. </X> </I>
