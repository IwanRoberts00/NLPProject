Falls creak Vancouver

<ICE-SIN:S2B-032#2:1:A>
Some a hundred years ago the poor Chinese immigrants who lived in
make-shift shelters here were often the objects of scorn and physical abuse

<ICE-SIN:S2B-032#3:1:A>
One particularly notorious attack involved two Chinamen tied
together by their pig-tails

<ICE-SIN:S2B-032#4:1:A>
They were thrown into the water for no reason other than they were
Chinese

<ICE-SIN:S2B-032#5:1:A>
In the right twist of history the whole stretch of the far bank
today belongs to and it's being developed by a Chinese Hong Kong billionaire
Lee Kah Shing

<ICE-SIN:S2B-032#6:1:A>
And overseeing the project is his Chinese Canadian associate Stanley
Kwok

<ICE-SIN:S2B-032#7:1:A>
This is just one example of the growing economic clout of ethnic
Chinese a phenomenon that stems from and resonates with an East-Asia in
ascendance

<ICE-SIN:S2B-032#8:1:A>
And that resonance especially with China is something that those who
called themselves the dragon descendants have always found hard to ignore

<ICE-SIN:S2B-032#9:1:A>
The Chinese Cultural Centre in Vancouver acts very much like the
centennial in the preservation of the ancient Chinese heritage

<ICE-SIN:S2B-032#10:1:A>
With that in mind one area in particular has been accorded high
priority

<ICE-SIN:S2B-032#11:1:A>
These children have been sent here by parents who wish to see them
retain the use of their mother tongue

<ICE-SIN:S2B-032#12:1:A>
The same intent also motivates others in the United States

<ICE-SIN:S2B-032#13:1:A>
Many parents are uncomfortable with the fact that their children
are fast losing their competence in the Chinese language

<ICE-SIN:S2B-032#14:1:A>
In the Chinese mind knowing the language is seen as crucial to the
tapping of the Chinese cultural wellspring and integral to the definition of
being Chinese

<ICE-SIN:S2B-032#15:1:A>
In days past that definition went even further to include a
political identification with China

<ICE-SIN:S2B-032#16:1:A>
Overseas Chinese money and support were instrumental in helping
doctor Sun Yat Sen overthrow the Manchu dynasty and for that contribution
doctor Soon was to call them the mother of the revolution

<ICE-SIN:S2B-032#17:1:A>
Evidence of such close links in the past can still be seen today

<ICE-SIN:S2B-032#18:1:A>
Many overseas Chinese continued to support their ancestral homeland
long after doctor Soon's death

<ICE-SIN:S2B-032#19:1:A>
The Japanese invasion of China in brutal treatment of civilians
between nineteen thirty-seven to nineteen forty-five saw not only a
tremendous outpouring of money for China's war effort but also arouse intense
animosity towards Japan China's enemy became the overseas Chinese as well

<ICE-SIN:S2B-032#20:1:A>
But World War Two also brought about a change in the relationship
between ethnic Chinese in America and China

<ICE-SIN:S2B-032#21:1:A>
Having fought for the United States they had showed clearly whether
allegiance and sense of belonging laid

<ICE-SIN:S2B-032#22:1:A>
They had become Americans But same experience were shared by those
who fought on Canada's side

<ICE-SIN:S2B-032#23:1:A>
Douglas Chang who was decorated for bravery in action remembers

<ICE-SIN:S2B-032#24:1:A>
But the unfolding drama in China continued to impact the ethnic
Chinese elsewhere especially those in South-East Asia

<ICE-SIN:S2B-032#25:1:A>
At first the fact that China had finally stood up after years of
humilation and turmoil was celebrated not only by those of the mainland but
also by the overseas Chinese

<ICE-SIN:S2B-032#26:1:A>
The celebration however was short-lived and any fond hope of
returning of returning to China was soon dashed by a confluent of factors

<ICE-SIN:S2B-032#27:1:A>
That question was to put thousands in a terrible fix

<ICE-SIN:S2B-032#28:1:A>
In Indonesia the involvement of some ethnic Chinese in the abortive
Communist coup of nineteen sixty-five implicated entire communities

<ICE-SIN:S2B-032#29:1:A>
In an atmosphere of turmoil and suspicion many innocent lives were
lost

<ICE-SIN:S2B-032#30:1:A>
That experience was a sombre reminder that any affiliation to China
even cultural was easily misconstrued and harshly rewarded

<ICE-SIN:S2B-032#31:1:A>
With Mao's cultural revolution links between ethnic Chinese in
China received a further blow

<ICE-SIN:S2B-032#32:1:A>
South-East Asia weary about any spill-over to their shores slammed
their doors shut to China

<ICE-SIN:S2B-032#33:1:A>
The change only came in nineteen seventy-nine when Teng Xiao Ping
flung China's doors open

<ICE-SIN:S2B-032#34:1:A>
With a billion people hungry for trade and product links with China
suddenly became an advantage

<ICE-SIN:S2B-032#35:1:A>
One of those who responded to that pull is the Chairman of
Singapore's United Overseas Bank Wee Chor Yeow Convinced that China offered
huge opportunities after a trip there in nineteen seventy-nine

<ICE-SIN:S2B-032#36:1:A>
Wee proceeded with his investments capitalising on the linkages
that ethnic Chinese enjoy

<ICE-SIN:S2B-032#37:1:A>
The empathy that ethnic Chinese abroad have for China and her ways
have made it easier for them to penetrate the huge market

<ICE-SIN:S2B-032#38:1:A>
This however has led some to question the motives of those who are
doing business with the mainland

<ICE-SIN:S2B-032#39:1:A>
A misconception ethnic Chinese will like to correct

<ICE-SIN:S2B-032#40:1:A>
By investing in China ethnic Chinese abroad have again renewed ties
with their ancestral homeland

<ICE-SIN:S2B-032#41:1:A>
But although forged by business rather than politics the
re-establishing of such ties will still have to be managed carefully

<ICE-SIN:S2B-032#42:1:A>
The renewal of ties with China is not initiated solely by the
ethnic Chinese abroad

<ICE-SIN:S2B-032#43:1:A>
China is also actively seeking to tap their resources and expertise

<ICE-SIN:S2B-032#44:1:A>
It is for this reason that the leaders of Singapore whose efforts
have contributed to the city state's economic prosperity are much sought
after visitors

<ICE-SIN:S2B-032#45:1:A>
But just how significant is the role played by ethnic Chinese
abroad in transforming China

<ICE-SIN:S2B-032#46:1:A>
The Senior Minister of Singapore Lee Kuan Yew

<ICE-SIN:S2B-032#47:1:A>
So in many ways a China that is doing well will also free the
ethnic Chinese abroad from the psychological stigma of being off-shoots of a
failed civilization

<ICE-SIN:S2B-032#48:1:A>
Not only that a China plugged into the modern world would also be
instrumental in shifting the economic centre of gravity to East Asia

<ICE-SIN:S2B-032#49:1:A>
But will China disappoint by failing again

<ICE-SIN:S2B-032#50:1:A>
The promise of an East Asian renaissance however goes beyond its
anticipated economic preeminence in the next century

<ICE-SIN:S2B-032#51:1:A>
Many believe that there is also much to rediscover in the Chinese
heritage so that tomorrow's progress will not be devoid of yesterday's wisdom

<ICE-SIN:S2B-032#52:1:A>
And here ethnic Chinese as inheritors of an ancient culture have
much to hold on to and share

<ICE-SIN:S2B-032#53:1:A>
But are ancient Chinese values relevant to modern living

<ICE-SIN:S2B-032#54:1:A>
In the West the increasing number of old folks living alone or in
homes is a reality that contradicts the fundamental Chinese ideal of filial
piety and respect for elders

<ICE-SIN:S2B-032#55:1:A>
This old man is seeing his family for the first time in over ten
years

<ICE-SIN:S2B-032#56:1:A>
He had chosen to stay behind in San Francisco when they emigrated
to Australia

<ICE-SIN:S2B-032#57:1:A>
Situations like these are not confined to Western societies

<ICE-SIN:S2B-032#58:1:A>
The pressures that modernisation brings are felt on a global level
and the ethnic Chinese are not spared

<ICE-SIN:S2B-032#59:1:A>
Does this mean that the Chinese tradition is also fast becoming
irrelevant in today's ground

<ICE-SIN:S2B-032#60:1:A>
In many ways the story of the overseas Chinese ends when the ethnic
Chinese abroad embrace the nationalities of their countries

<ICE-SIN:S2B-032#61:1:A>
These children for example may not consider themselves as overseas
Chinese and rightly so because they are Americans

<ICE-SIN:S2B-032#62:1:A>
But they and others like them will inherit a tradition that had
guided their parents and the Chinese people for thousand of years

<ICE-SIN:S2B-032#63:1:A>
So will they discard that heritage in a rapidly changing world or
will they try to harmonise the ancient wisdom found in it with the demands of
modernisation

<ICE-SIN:S2B-032#64:1:A>
Their choice will determine what is to be written in the epilogue
of the story of the overseas Chinese </I>

Handphones you just can't leave home without it

<ICE-SIN:S2B-032#66:2:B>
That's what hundred and twenty thousand Singaporeans say and for
Japanese models which are forty per cent of this market prices look set to
increase

<ICE-SIN:S2B-032#67:2:B>
Whether prices for handphones will go up will depend much on where
the Yen is heading

<ICE-SIN:S2B-032#68:2:B>
In the past six months the Yen rose by more than twelve per cent
against the Sing dollar

<ICE-SIN:S2B-032#69:2:B>
So far most brands including Sony Sharp Pioneer have taken a hard
bash from the Yen's rise

<ICE-SIN:S2B-032#70:2:B>
In the past month prices of these Japanese goods have risen by
three to ten per cent

<ICE-SIN:S2B-032#71:2:B>
The full twelve per cent rise in the Yen may not be reflected on
their price tags yet but for the four wheelers the price hike is beyond the
full rise of the Yen

<ICE-SIN:S2B-032#72:2:B>
The OMV or open market value of the car includes the insurance
freight charges customs uplift which is a form of tax on the car and their
invoice cost which is affected by the currency movements

<ICE-SIN:S2B-032#73:2:B>
Take a family car the Honda Civic one point six ESI manual
transmission

<ICE-SIN:S2B-032#74:2:B>
Six months back the OMV was seventeen thousand dollars

<ICE-SIN:S2B-032#75:2:B>
Today with the Yen factor it's at twenty thousand dollars an
increase of three thousand

<ICE-SIN:S2B-032#76:2:B>
With custom duties and the additional registration fee or ARF of
hundred and ninety-five per cent the three thousand increase is further
compounded to nearly nine thousand dollars

<ICE-SIN:S2B-032#77:2:B>
And these price increases have been largely borne by car buyers

<ICE-SIN:S2B-032#78:2:B>
Across the board other Japanese cars like Mitsubishi Nissan Toyota
have all increased their prices with the rise of the Yen

<ICE-SIN:S2B-032#79:2:B>
And some businessmen say that their profit margins have been
squeezed as they have to bear part of the Yen's rise

<ICE-SIN:S2B-032#80:2:B>
Although recent political upheaval in Japan has sent the Yen
sliding a little some say this may just be a temporary breather

<ICE-SIN:S2B-032#81:2:B>
With the pressure to keep the Yen strong some people hope for a
replay of what took place in the eighties when the rising Yen then led to a
surge of Japanese investments here

<ICE-SIN:S2B-032#82:2:B>
The Yen factor today does not call for a celebration here or in
Japan

<ICE-SIN:S2B-032#83:2:B>
Keeping watch on the Yen and waiting for the sun to rise again is
now just part of the Japanese way of life </I>

<ICE-SIN:S2B-032#84:3:C>
It was a hot day but these people were undaunted

<ICE-SIN:S2B-032#85:3:C>
Some have queued for more than twelve hours for the chance to buy a
choice unit at Parc Oasis a new condo development in Jurong East

<ICE-SIN:S2B-032#86:3:C>
The apartments were snapped up as if they were free

<ICE-SIN:S2B-032#87:3:C>
Buyers were willing to pay more than four hundred thousands dollars
for each unit

<ICE-SIN:S2B-032#88:3:C>
That was a month ago

<ICE-SIN:S2B-032#89:3:C>
Today buyers are willing to pay up to fifty thousand dollars more
in the resale market

<ICE-SIN:S2B-032#90:3:C>
Not surprising new condos in the outlying Nort-West North and
North-East of the island went like hot cakes last year

<ICE-SIN:S2B-032#91:3:C>
Projects like Hue Park Bishan Park and Tanah Merah were sold within
days

<ICE-SIN:S2B-032#92:3:C>
The Tanah Merah for example

<ICE-SIN:S2B-032#93:3:C>
More than thirty per cent of the buyers were upgraders from the
nearby HDB towns

<ICE-SIN:S2B-032#94:3:C>
To cater to this niche market most of the properties are priced in
the mid level range with different locations commanding different prices

<ICE-SIN:S2B-032#95:3:C>
But on average condos in the North-West like Upper Bukit Timah cost
ten per cent more than the other two regions

<ICE-SIN:S2B-032#96:3:C>
They're popular with expatriates working in the nearby Jurong
Industrial estate

<ICE-SIN:S2B-032#97:3:C>
Rents in this region are also one to two per cent higher

<ICE-SIN:S2B-032#98:3:C>
But compared to the prime districts East and West Coast rents in
outlying areas are as attractive

<ICE-SIN:S2B-032#99:3:C>
But not so for Anthony Fong

<ICE-SIN:S2B-032#100:3:C>
He made good capital gains rather quickly

<ICE-SIN:S2B-032#101:3:C>
This Dairy Farm apartment was bought last year for six hundred
thousand

<ICE-SIN:S2B-032#102:3:C>
Today Anthony can sell it for almost a million

<ICE-SIN:S2B-032#103:3:C>
Like Dairy Farm prices of condos in the North-West tend to rise
faster and higher than those in the other regions half a per cent higher than
the North and two per cent more than the North-East

<ICE-SIN:S2B-032#104:3:C>
Even with the record two thousand condo units to be launched in
the next two years prices in Upper Bukit Timah are unlikely to fall

<ICE-SIN:S2B-032#105:3:C>
Another up and coming area in the North-West is Woodlands the
future business and leisure hub in the North

<ICE-SIN:S2B-032#106:3:C>
To be built within the next ten years the Woodlands regional
centre will have entertainment joints cinemas and offices

<ICE-SIN:S2B-032#107:3:C>
By nineteen ninety-six the MRT will be completed and the American
School will have relocated here

<ICE-SIN:S2B-032#108:3:C>
These developments will benefit the eight hundred units of new
condos and houses along Woodlands Avenue one but that's in two years' time

<ICE-SIN:S2B-032#109:3:C>
Meanwhile the more established areas like Yishun and Yio Chu Kang
are drawing the crowds

<ICE-SIN:S2B-032#110:3:C>
The next most popular region after the North-West condos like
Bullion Park cost about four hundred dollars per square foot

<ICE-SIN:S2B-032#111:3:C>
But the closer they are to the city in Bishan and Ang Mo Kio the
higher the price and the greater the demand

<ICE-SIN:S2B-032#112:3:C>
Another popular area is the North-East

<ICE-SIN:S2B-032#113:3:C>
Along Upper Changi road Loyang and Pasir Ris

<ICE-SIN:S2B-032#114:3:C>
These may not be near the city but they are cheaper than the North
and North-West <X>

<ICE-SIN:S2B-032#X115:3:C>
The main attraction however is its proximity to the East Coast
and the surrounding recreation clubs In addition homebuyers are also wooed by
plans to transform nearby Tampines into another business regional centre
Developers are optimistic about the potential of this area as can be seen
from the number of condos sprouting up especially along Upper Changi road So
far five hundred and twenty units have already been matketed and another one
thousand four hundred will be launched in the next two years A few streets
away in Simei a new condo will hit the market in September Hailed as the
largest development in Singapore more than one thousand two hundred units
will be up for sale This will bring the total number of condos in the
North-East to a staggering two thousand nine hundred Another two thousand six
hundred is expected in the North-West and more than eight hundred in the
North The total supply coming on stream is an overwhelming six thousand four
hundred units in the next two years So it seems there's no need for scenes
like these anymore With ample supply coming up buyers should'nt panic but
take their time to pick the right homes </X> </I>
