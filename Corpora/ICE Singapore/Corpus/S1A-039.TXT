Ya try try before these people finish

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-039#188:1:C>
I keep eyeing for that

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-039#189:1:A>
I made that one Tuesday or Wednesday

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-039#190:1:B>
Uhm

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-039#191:1:A>
I froze the I had to freeze the pastry overnight

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-039#192:1:C>
Uhm

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-039#193:1:A>
The dough

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-039#194:1:B>
The mixture

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-039#195:1:A>
And then when it comes out it's like hard like rock

<ICE-SIN:S1A-039#196:1:A>
Then you just thaw it for a while and you just quickly work at it
and you dump it to the oven

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-039#197:1:C>
Uhm

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-039#198:1:A>
Uhm

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-039#199:1:B>
The pie is not bad but a bit soft uh

<ICE-SIN:S1A-039#200:1:B>
Is it supposed to be like that

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-039#201:1:A>
No it's supposed to be harder

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-039#202:1:C>
Uhm

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-039#203:1:A>
Ya firmer

<ICE-SIN:S1A-039#204:1:A>
But the taste is okay right

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-039#205:1:B>
<unclear> word </unclear>

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-039#206:1:C>
Ya the taste is good

<ICE-SIN:S1A-039#207:1:C>
How many times have you made this

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-039#208:1:A>
This pie

<ICE-SIN:S1A-039#209:1:A>
It's my first time

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-039#210:1:C>
Oh it's an experiment too

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-039#211:1:A>
Ya it's a miracle

<ICE-SIN:S1A-039#212:1:A>
I don't know how I can serve you all experiments

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-039#213:1:B>
<unclear> word </unclear> this your potential <unclear> word
</unclear>

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-039#214:1:A>
<unclear> word </unclear> Well actually a regular custard pie
is when you make it with condensed milk whereas this is the custard pie with
the custard powder

<ICE-SIN:S1A-039#215:1:A>
The regular custard pie is when you bake the whole thing with the
pie

<ICE-SIN:S1A-039#216:1:A>
So that's why my pie I bake my pie crust separately

<ICE-SIN:S1A-039#217:1:A>
And it cracked because usually for a regular after you make a pie
crust you add this metallic thing to it you know

<ICE-SIN:S1A-039#218:1:A>
It's like it's it's in a shape of like a high dish type thing and
it's usually <unclear> word </unclear>

<ICE-SIN:S1A-039#219:1:A>
And you press it down so that when the pie bakes it wouldn't pluff
up and break and I didn't do that you see

<ICE-SIN:S1A-039#220:1:A>
I just had to take the risk

<ICE-SIN:S1A-039#221:1:A>
Ya I can I've only found that thing in the States

<ICE-SIN:S1A-039#222:1:A>
Maybe I should get my friends to you know send it to me

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-039#223:1:C>
Uhm

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-039#224:1:B>
Ya

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-039#225:1:A>
'Cos this is the first time I've made other pies

<ICE-SIN:S1A-039#226:1:A>
