<ICE-SIN:W2B-017#6:1>
Alex Sim, a 19-year-old national serviceman, took five days' leave in
August 1986 to spend some time with Sara, his girlfriend of four months.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-017#7:1>
Until then, their relationship had been restricted to telephone
conversations.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-017#8:1>
Subsequent dates followed in the next few days.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-017#9:1>
On 30 August 1986, Alex made an appointment to meet Sara at the Ang Mo
Kio bus interchange around 7 pm.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-017#10:1>
" Hi, Kwong Huat.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-017#11:1>
Sorry I'm late," said Sara, looking at Alex with plaintive eyes.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-017#12:1>
To his army buddies, he was Alex but Sara preferred the more
endearing " Kwong Huat".

<ICE-SIN:W2B-017#13:1>
" That's okay.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-017#14:1>
I've also just arrived," Alex replied.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-017#15:1>
" Have you got the tickets for the show yet?"

<ICE-SIN:W2B-017#16:1>
Sara asked as they walked hand in hand across the crowded
interchange.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-017#17:1>
" Too bad Sara, the tickets were all sold out.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-017#18:1>
It's so difficult to get tickets on Saturday nights," Alex explained
apologetically.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-017#19:1>
" I know.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-017#20:1>
People are usually free on Saturday nights," Sara said.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-017#21:1>
" Why don't we see if there is another show that we can watch?"

<ICE-SIN:W2B-017#22:1>
They walked towards New Town Cinema.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-017#23:1>
It was already twenty-five minutes past the scheduled screening time
of the show when they arrived.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-017#24:1>
Alex suggested that they go to the nearby Broadway Cinema.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-017#25:1>
They finally gave up the idea of watching a movie that evening after
realizing that the show being screened was one they had already seen.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-017#26:1>
The couple strolled around the area for a while, then crossed over to
Ang Mo Kio Street 12, and sat down on one of the concrete benches in front of
Block 125.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-017#27:1>
It was a rare opportunity for the young couple to be together.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-017#28:1>
Alex and Sara did not mind that the bench in front of Block 125 was
not exactly a romantic spot as long as they had each other for company.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-017#29:1>
" How's work?" Alex asked.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-017#30:1>
" Oh, it's okay, I suppose.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-017#31:1>
What about you?

<ICE-SIN:W2B-017#32:1>
Do you have to report back to camp tomorrow?"

<ICE-SIN:W2B-017#33:1>
Alex nodded.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-017#34:1>
They continued chatting, oblivious to what was going on around them.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-017#35:1>
Their private concern for each other was rudely interrupted by a
sudden commotion at the void deck of Block 125.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-017#36:1>
A horde of teenagers brandishing iron pipes were talking in raised
voices.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-017#37:1>
Meanwhile, seemingly out of nowhere, a yellow lorry stopped directly
across from where Alex and Sara were seated.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-017#38:1>
A handful of teenagers jumped down and rushed towards the void deck
of Block 125.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-017#39:1>
One of them crept up on Alex from behind and struck him on his left
shoulder with an iron pipe.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-017#40:1>
He got up to confront the assailant, only to be struck again.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-017#41:1>
Sara, shocked by the sudden attack on he date, froze in horror.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-017#42:1>
Alex tried to run away from his attacker but could only manage a few
steps before he collapsed.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-017#43:1>
The others immediately surrounded the helpless Alex and swung their
iron pipes mercilessly at him.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-017#44:1>
Instinctively Alex shielded his head from thc attack with his hands.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-017#45:1>
Recovering from her initial shock, Sara ran as fast as her wobbly
legs could carry her towards Ang Mo Kio Central to get help.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-017#46:1>
As she ran, she could hear Alex pleading with his assailant in
Hokkien that he was not the person they were after.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-017#47:1>
Then just as suddenly as they had descended or their defenceless
victim, the assailants withdrew and ran towards the yellow lorry.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-017#48:1>
They clambered up the back of the lorry which whisked them off into
the night.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-017#49:1>
All was quiet again at Block 125 as if nothing had happened.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-017#50:1>
Alex struggled to his feet.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-017#51:1>
He was gravely injured but kept telling himself that he must get help
quickly.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-017#52:1>
He managed to hail a taxi and directed the driver to his home.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-017#53:1>
Meanwhile, Sara contacted Ah Siong, a friend of Alex also known to
her, for help.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-017#54:1>
Ah Siong informed Alex's parents.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-017#55:1>
Together, they made their way to Block 125.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-017#56:1>
Failing to locate his son, Alex's father telephoned home and found
out that Alex had already returned home.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-017#57:1>
" Sis, can you get me a glass of water?"

<ICE-SIN:W2B-017#58:1>
Alex asked his sister in a voice no louder than a whisper as he sat
on the living room sofa, his head throbbing with pain.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-017#59:1>
After taking the drink, Alex felt drowsy.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-017#60:1>
He laid down and closed his eyes...

<ICE-SIN:W2B-017#61:1>
When Alex's parents along with Sara returned home, they thought that
Alex was resting on the sofa.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-017#62:1>
Sara had just finished recounting the evening's incident to Alex's
parents when she sensed that something was wrong.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-017#63:1>
Getting no response from the apparently lifeless form after repeated
calls, Alex's brother-in-law immediately called the ambulance.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-017#64:1>
By the time the police and ambulance arrived, Alex was already dead.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-017#65:1>
It was a miracle that he could even make his way home in spite of his
extensive and fatal injuries.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-017#66:1>
At the police station, Inspector Ng was puzzled by the assault on
Alex.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-017#67:1>
There seemed to be no motive for the vicious attack.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-017#68:1>
Could it have been a case of mistaken identity as evidenced by Alex's
desperate plea with his assailants that he was not the man they sought?

<ICE-SIN:W2B-017#69:1>
Or was there some undiscovered or undisclosed motive behind the
assault?

<ICE-SIN:W2B-017#70:1>
The pilot episode of Crime Watch was telecast on 30 November 1986.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-017#71:1>
Among the cases re-enacted was the murder of Alex Sim.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-017#72:1>
Police appealed for information which could assist them in their
investigations.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-017#73:1>
They were not to be disappointed.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-017#74:1>
A man called the Police Hotline as the number was being flashed
across the television screen.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-017#75:1>
Speaking in Hokkien, the man revealed the identities of two
characters whom he claimed would be able to shed light on the murder.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-017#76:1>
The police swung into action.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-017#77:1>
The whereabouts of the two men were quickly ascertained and they were
taken to the Criminal Investigation Department for questioning.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-017#78:1>
Disclaiming any involvement in the fatal attack, they nevertheless
expressed their suspicion that members of the Ang Soon Tong Triad Society
were responsible.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-017#79:1>
Pursuing this lead resulted in further allegations that yet another
secret society was involved.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-017#80:1>
Police investigators, egged on by the belief that the truth about the
case was close at hand, continued with renewed vigour.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-017#81:1>
Before long, the police were able to establish that the headman and
several members of the Gi Leng Kiat Secret Society of the " 24" Group were
responsible for the murder.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-017#82:1>
The police had to act fast.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-017#83:1>
A series of raids was conducted at various housing estates and 33
suspects were arrested.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-017#84:1>
Ten of them were released after questioning while the rest were held
in custody for involvement in secret society activities.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-017#85:1>
Of these, nine were charged in court for the murder of Alex Sim.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-017#86:1>
The youngest in the group was only 16 years old while the oldest was
19.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-017#87:1>
" What's your name?"

<ICE-SIN:W2B-017#88:1>
Inspector Ng asked the leader of the gang in Hokkien.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-017#89:1>
" Tan Leng Siong".

<ICE-SIN:W2B-017#90:1>
" Any aliases?"

<ICE-SIN:W2B-017#91:1>
" Simon".

<ICE-SIN:W2B-017#92:1>
After warning Simon to state " truly the facts and circumstances" of
the incident, Inspector Ng sat behind his typewriter, ready to record the
events that led to the murder...

<ICE-SIN:W2B-017#93:1>
Simon first came into contact with secret-society activities in 1984
while still attending secondary school.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-017#94:1>
He befriended members of the Ang So Tong Triad of the Ji It group and
was soon recruited into its fold.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-017#95:1>
Not long after his indoctrination into the group, the headman
demanded
&dollar;250 from Simon.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-017#96:1>
The adolescent was unable to raise the money and reported the
incident to his mother.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-017#97:1>
The police were informed and the headman was subsequently arrested.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-017#98:1>
It was then that Simon had his first brush with the law.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-017#99:1>
He was interviewed by officers of the Criminal Investigation
Department and advised to disassociate himself from the gang.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-017#100:1>
He did so...but not for long.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-017#101:1>
The members of the Ang Soon Tong Triad Society did not take kindly
to Simon's betrayal and threatened to assault him.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-017#102:1>
Terrified, Simon sought protection from the Gi Leng Kiat Secret
Society of the " 24" group.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-017#103:1>
In mid-1985, Simon had his second brush with the law.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-017#104:1>
The ever vigilant police force moved in on the gang.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-017#105:1>
Several members of the gang were arrested and dealt with under the
Criminal Law ( Temporary Provisions) Act.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-017#106:1>
Simon was however fortunate enough to escape arrest.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-017#107:1>
As a result of the incident, the remaining society members kept a
low profile for some time.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-017#108:1>
The following year Simon established the Gi Leng Kiat Secret Society
of the " 24" group at Block 10 Ang Mo Kio.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-017#109:1>
With almost two years of background experience in secret society
affairs, Simon had the confidence to appoint himself as headman.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-017#110:1>
His concerted efforts to recruit members proved fruitful.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-017#111:1>
Within a year, 19 teenagers had pledged their allegiance to the
society.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-017#112:1>
On 29 August 1986, Simon and his gang met at the void deck of Block
104 Ang Mo Kio.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-017#113:1>
It was during their deliberations on what they should do that night
that they came upon the idea of gatecrashing a social function being held at
the community hall at Block 161 Ang Mo Kio.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-017#114:1>
On their way there, Simon met some of his friends and went off with
them while the rest of the gang proceeded on to the community hall.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-017#115:1>
The community hall was packed with youths dancing to the latest pop
hits.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-017#116:1>
The gang members quickly joined in the fun.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-017#117:1>
One of them, Lim Eu Soon started to flaunt his dancing skills.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-017#118:1>
He danced so well that many girls started to clap for him, much to
the displeasure of their partners, who happened to be members of the Ang Soon
Tong Triad Society.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-017#119:1>
These young men from a rival society closed in on Eu Soon and beat
him up so badly that his friends had to carry him out of the community hall.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-017#120:1>
Indignant at the attack on one of his men, Simon decided to
retaliate.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-017#121:1>
he gathered his supporters, armed them with wooden poles and
bottles, and led them to the community hall.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-017#122:1>
When they got there, they found no sign of the rival triad group.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-017#123:1>
The police, having been alerted by the passers-by of the impending
fight, arrived a few minutes later.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-017#124:1>
Simon and his gang dispersed.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-017#125:1>
Simon's gang regrouped later that evening at their " operational"
territory at Block 125, Ang Mo Kio.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-017#126:1>
They decided to launch a retaliatory attack on the rival triad
group.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-017#127:1>
However, before they could finalize plans for the attack, two
uniformed police officers approached them.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-017#128:1>
They quickly dispersed.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-017#129:1>
The next day saw Simon busy with the preparations for the attack
that evening.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-017#130:1>
He met up with several members of an affiliated gang to make
arrangements for the weapons he needed.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-017#131:1>
Using his many contacts, Simon managed to borrow a yellow lorry.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-017#132:1>
The entire operation was carried out with the efficiency of
well-structured military exercise.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-017#133:1>
Simon saw to it the advice of the senior members of the Gi Leng Kiat
Triad Society was sought.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-017#134:1>
Allies were requested " recce" Block 125.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-017#135:1>
Finally, the blueprint for the evening's attack was completed.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-017#136:1>
On 30th August 1986, Simon and his gang met Block 104, Ang Mo Kio,
at 7 pm.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-017#137:1>
Among those present were members of an affiliated gang.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-017#138:1>
Simon contacted his reconnaissance party about the situation at
Block 125, Ang Mo Kio.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-017#139:1>
He was informed that there were some youths loitering there.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-017#140:1>
The " recce" team also briefed Simon on the various possible places
where weapons could be concealed.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-017#141:1>
Thus informed, Simon decided that it was time for action.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-017#142:1>
Armed with iron pipes, the horde of youngsters clambered up the
yellow lorry that was to bring them to Block 125.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-017#143:1>
Before alighting, Simon instructed the driver to park the lorry at
the junction of Ang Mo Kio Avenue 6 and Ang Mo Kio Street 12.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-017#144:1>
Like a general leading his troop into fierce combact, Simon advanced
towards Block 125 ahead of his comrades.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-017#145:1>
The place was deserted except for a couple sitting on a concrete
bench.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-017#146:1>
Suddenly, one of gang members shouted in Hokkien.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-017#147:1>
" That's him!"

<ICE-SIN:W2B-017#148:1>
Eager for action and thinking that the young man was a member of the
rival gang, Simon rushed over and hit the man across the left shoulder with
an iron pipe. <X>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-017#X149:1>
The man immediately stood up but Simon struck him down again.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-017#X150:1>
The impetus for the confrontation having been supplied by Simon's
first blow, the rest of his gang rushed forward to join in the fracas. </X>
