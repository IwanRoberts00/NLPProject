<h> Software Roundup Green adventure Learn about the value of a
rainforest, and the animal and plantlife in it in this enjoyable game </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-038#2:1>
by Francis Chin If you have enjoyed Eco-Quest I, you will find its
sequel, Lost Secret of the Rainforest, even better.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-038#3:1>
Filled as a learning program, it is an ecological adventure game that
takes you into the Amazon Jungle.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-038#4:1>
The action begins at the port of Iquitos, where you, as the
environmentally conscious boy Adam Greene, and his father have just landed.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-038#5:1>
Things immediately go awry as you face hostile customs officials,
luggage thieves and a couple of suspicious characters.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-038#6:1>
In the rainforest, you can climb to different levels of the forest
from floor to canopy, and find out about the animals living there.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-038#7:1>
As you progress, you must solve ecological and botanical puzzles
blocking your path.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-038#8:1>
You can also visit strange places populated with animals that talk and
other engaging characters, and be pursued by a group of baddies who are all
out to loot and despoil the forest.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-038#9:1>
The game teaches the value of a forest, and the critical relationship
between species and environmental protection.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-038#10:1>
The graphics in 256 colours are sharp and smooth, giving a
3-dimensional realism to the scenes.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-038#11:1>
A Help feature provides clues and hints when you are stuck.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-038#12:1>
While the game is billed as for children from 10 and above, adults
will find Lost Secrets of the Rainforest just as playable and enjoyable.

Check your grammar, select all kinds of fonts, manipulate text to
your heart's content, search for words quickly from any document in the
system, calculate spreadsheet problems and even fax your document directly.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-038#20:1>
These are what Version 6.0 of WordPerfect, the world's top-selling
DOS word processor, can do.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-038#21:1>
The program will be out in June, and the version reviewed is a
pre-release one.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-038#22:1>
Although a DOS program, its graphic user interface is closer to that
of a Windows product.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-038#23:1>
It has three editing modes: text mode, similar to that in WordPerfect
5.1; graphics mode, that gives a graphic representation of fonts, pictures
and colours as you edit; and page mode, like the graphics mode but with page
numbers, footnotes and headers shown during editing.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-038#24:1>
The graphics mode has menu push buttons, like those now used in
WordPerfect 5.2 for Windows.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-038#25:1>
You can also move, drag, drop or add buttons.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-038#26:1>
In effect, you get Windows ease of use without its sluggishness and
high demand on RAM and hard disk space.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-038#27:1>
WP6 can also handle Windows typefaces such as ATM Type 1, Intellifont
and Microsoft's TrueType fonts.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-038#28:1>
Hence, a WP6 document can be read by a Windows program with the same
fonts and types displayed unchanged.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-038#29:1>
A spreadsheet will be an integral part of the program.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-038#30:1>
You use Tables to perform true spreadsheet calculation with formulas
and functions, and cell formatting.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-038#31:1>
You can open up to nine different documents on the screen, as opposed
to the current two.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-038#32:1>
They can be tiled ( laid out side by side so that you can glance at
all of them) or cascaded ( stacked in a row) on screen.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-038#33:1>
WP6 will run on a 286 PC with 450 kilobyte or more of free RAM and 7
megabyte of hard disk space.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-038#34:1>
The program is not rated since it is yet to be launched.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-038#35:1>
All bases covered Superbase 2.0 is fast and responsive Not many know
that Superbase was the first large database program to run on Windows.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-038#36:1>
Software Publishing Corporation ( SPC) has combined two earlier
versions, Superbase 2 and the more expensive Superbase 4, into one: Superbase
version 2.0.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-038#37:1>
The result is a program with extensive features to handle the most
demanding corporate database needs.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-038#38:1>
It is fast and responsive and its well-laid out menus and dialogue
boxes are a pleasure to use.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-038#39:1>
The core of Superbase's database design is the concept of the file
family.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-038#40:1>
When you create a new database, you are creating not a single file
but a collection of files, each fulfilling a specific function.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-038#41:1>
You will have the basic data file and various index files ( records
are sorted and indexed according to the fields).

<ICE-SIN:W2B-038#42:1>
You can also have the database displayed as a form or as a report.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-038#43:1>
Databases are easily and quickly created.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-038#44:1>
The many pop-up dialogue boxes will guide you through in creating
the fields, defining the data types and formatting the data to be entered.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-038#45:1>
You can have up to 1 billion records in a single database file and an
unlimited number of fields per record.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-038#46:1>
Also, each field can have space for up to 4,000 characters.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-038#47:1>
You can attach external text files to a field.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-038#48:1>
Superbase power comes in the filtering of records, the lookup setting
to link one set of records to another set in another database, and the
linking of databases.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-038#49:1>
Forms and reports can be designed as you wish, and can include
imported graphics and bitmap images.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-038#50:1>
There is a special programming language to fine-tune and customise
your database collection.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-038#51:1>
System requirements: You need at least a 386 PC with 4 MB of RAM,
from 5 to 7 MB of hard disk space.

<h> Client/servers successful but...Client/server systems are
successful only when implemented as part of a firm's re-engineering strategy
</h>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-038#59:1>
by Kevin Lim

<ICE-SIN:W2B-038#60:1>
More large companies are replacing their older mainframes and
minicomputers with client/server systems.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-038#61:1>
The reasons are many.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-038#62:1>
A network of PCs and workstations - - on which client/server
applications are built - - costs less than a mainframe of equivalent power.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-038#63:1>
Client/server solutions also involve distributed computing where work
is shared by the client ( the PC) and the server ( either a high-end PC or
workstation).

<ICE-SIN:W2B-038#64:1>
Hence a database or even a heavy-duty engineering program can be
produced on the PC, with the server acting only as backup or a means of
distributing the data.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-038#65:1>
In contrast, the old mainframe environment requires all
number-crunching to be done at the mainframe level, as dumb terminals can
only relay signals to and from the main computer.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-038#66:1>
This unnecessarily slows the system down.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-038#67:1>
But switching to client/server systems has not always been positive.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-038#68:1>
International Data Corporation ( IDC), a research firm, following a
survey of large users in the US earlier this year, said: " Mainframes clearly
involve higher capital costs.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-038#69:1>
However, we believe that it is a mistake to extrapolate that higher
capital costs necessarily incur higher operating costs.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-038#70:1>
" Indeed, for certain complex applications, mainframes enjoy distinct
cost advantages over local area networks ( LANs)."

<ICE-SIN:W2B-038#71:1>
Mr Klaus Wenger, Andersen Consulting's regional coordinator for its
Asean/Greater China Technology Integration Services organisation added: "
There are probably hundreds of client/server type systems that have failed to
deliver.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-038#72:1>
These failures have however never been highlighted.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-038#73:1>
According to IDC, staffing costs account for a large portion of total
running costs of complex networks.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-038#74:1>
And even if companies are prepared to pay for staff, they may not get
enough of IT professionals who are familiar with client/server systems, said
Mr Lionel Lim, Asean managing director of Sun Microsystems.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-038#75:1>
Added Mr Wenger: " Even though LAN flexibility improves personal
productivity, it can dramatically increase complexity, and therefore systems
management costs as workloads increase in sophistication." dditionally, some
issues still plague client/server systems.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-038#76:1>
Security and maintenance of remote servers containing critical
information are two such key issues.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-038#77:1>
So why switch to client/server?

<ICE-SIN:W2B-038#78:1>
Mr K C Lee, the National Computer Board's assistant chief executive,
Government Systems Division, said that " by comparing cost alone, you are not
comparing apples with apples.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-038#79:1>
You can do more on a PC than on a dumb server".

<ICE-SIN:W2B-038#80:1>
With the emphasis on service, front-end counter staff will need more
processing power in order to respond quickly to customer enquiries.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-038#81:1>
And while he concedes that mainframes still possess several
advantages, the government expects to spend more on client/servers over the
next few years while mainframe related expenses will remain the same
proportion of the total budget, he said.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-038#82:1>
The increasing emphasis on multimedia which takes up more digital
space on networks, will also give mainframe systems more problems.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-038#83:1>
Electronic Data Systems, the systems integrator for the recent USA '
94 World Cup, said concern about delivering multi-media type information was
one of the main reasons that prompted the World Cup organisers to choose a
client/server system.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-038#84:1>
This system, built on Sun Microsystems workstations, provided on-line
and on-time information to journalists and officials involved in the World
Cup in nine US venues and Zurich, Switzerland where FIFA ( the world soccer
body) is based.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-038#85:1>
Mr Cheche Vidal Noya, vice-president in charge of technology for the
World Cup USA 94, said: " We identified a client/server model right from the
start because we knew it can overcome the geographic, logistical applications
and information challenges presented by this event.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-038#86:1>
" And we were proven right.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-038#87:1>
All our applications were developed very quickly and easily.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-038#88:1>
More importantly, we were able to implement these applications
rapidly in a very large network".

<ICE-SIN:W2B-038#89:1>
Users must realise that to fully benefit from client/server systems,
they must incorporate it into the whole process of change, which covers not
just computers but the entire business processes in their companies.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-038#90:1>
<h> Handy Computing with the PDA Smaller and lighter than a filofax
or mobile phone, the personal digital assistant ( PDA) is finally gaining
recognition </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-038#91:1>
by Cheng Chee Seng

<ICE-SIN:W2B-038#92:1>
The application that is giving hope to personal digital assistant (
PDA) makers is wireless communications.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-038#93:1>
PDAs like the Apple Newton MessagePad allow users to send and receive
data wirelessly.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-038#94:1>
The Newton has an infrared capability that allows users to beam data
across to another Newton.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-038#95:1>
With many applications now available, the PDA is not only a roving
electronic secretary but also a stocks adviser and the gateway to the
electronic highways of information banks and communications worldwide.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-038#96:1>
Although they are commonly known as palmtop computers here, PDAs are
not computers in the true sense of the word.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-038#97:1>
You cannot run your favourite software applications such as Windows,
WordPerfect, or QuarkX-press on them.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-038#98:1>
Neither is it practical to prepare your company's
&dollar;60 million budget and write a 100,000 word novel on them.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-038#99:1>
They are small - - half the size of a shorthand pad weighing under
350 gm.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-038#100:1>
Most have either a QWERTY keyboard ( like the HP100LX) or pen-based
design ( like the Newton MessagePad 110).

<ICE-SIN:W2B-038#101:1>
The Sharp Wizard on the other hand is a hybrid with a keyboard as
well as an on-screen sketch-pad.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-038#102:1>
Apple's Newton blazed the trail for PDAs.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-038#103:1>
But the reception when they were launched 12 to 18 months ago was
cold because the PDA did not live up to its expectations of being an
electronic filofax.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-038#104:1>
One possibility is that there were insufficient applications to run
on the Newton.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-038#105:1>
The crucial faxing, paging, connection software and other important
utilities did not appear in time.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-038#106:1>
As a result, the Newton was seen as just a pen-based electronic
organiser that recognises handwriting.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-038#107:1>
A more plausible explanation is that consumers were perhaps looking
for desktop computing power in a palmtop or PDA.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-038#108:1>
New developments in the region's data communication technologies and
infrastructure have changed this.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-038#109:1>
Also, consumers are now more aware of the true role of PDAs as a
pocketable mobile personal information device that also provides two-way
information exchange.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-038#110:1>
It is interesting that where Apple flounders, palmtop computer
pioneer Hewlett-Packard ( HP) has been quietly moving towards its goal of
being the " most connectable" PDA.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-038#111:1>
The second generation and higher-powered HP100LX offers users
real-time stocks prices and news-flashes round-the-clock.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-038#112:1>
This new service has been put together by HP together with Singapore
Telecom and Motorola which developed the modem for this service.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-038#113:1>
But it is with the introduction of Singapore Telecom's new public
mobile data service, DataRoam, in late July that two-way wireless
transmission became a reality.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-038#114:1>
By plugging the Motorola InfoTac data communicator into the HP100LX,
a user will gain instant access into the new world of wireless two-way
communications. <X>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-038#X115:1>
In other words, you may be working on a ship anchored at the
Eastern Anchorage in Singapore port but you can still check your electronic
messages in your office PC or monitor your stock portfolio.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-038#X116:1>
You can even confer with service engineers back home in your
headquarters in the United States.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-038#X117:1>
Digital Equipment Singapore's field service engineers are using a
DataRoam service to keep in touch with customers.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-038#X118:1>
Engineers at the customer site can access Digital's database
located in the United States for information and recommend solutions almost
immediately.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-038#X119:1>
Postmen from Singapore Post's Local Urgent Mail Service are
directed to their destinations through the DataRoam service, resulting in
faster service.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-038#X120:1>
With seven out of the 21 wireless networks in the world located in
Asia where many areas still lack good communications infrastructure, PDAs
could well become very popular.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-038#X121:1>
Mr Tan Kiok Siang, Marketing Manager for Hewlett Packard's mobile
products estimated that sales for the palmtops in the last ten months jumped
70 percent.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-038#X122:1>
" I am confident that the upward trend will continue especially
with the tremendous opportunities offered by wireless comunication".

<ICE-SIN:W2B-038#X123:1>
A hope that will no doubt be shared by key players like Apple,
Amstrad, Tandy, Casio and Compaq.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-038#X124:1>
PDA's success rests on software developers.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-038#X125:1>
They have to develop more applications especially in the credit
card sized PCMCIA format.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-038#X126:1>
Already some PCMCIA-based applications are available like
Travelling Software's Newton Connection for Windows, Ex Machina's PocketCall
( a terminal emulation software) and Microsoft's " Microsoft At Work"
operating system for hand-held device adopted by Compaq for their yet
unnamed PDA.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-038#X127:1>
With the exception of a couple of companies here like Reuters
Singapore and Associated Breweries, companies are still unconvinced about the
benefits of palmtop devices.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-038#X128:1>
But the good news is there are more companies assessing PDAs for
their use.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-038#X129:1>
For example, courier companies are looking into their use.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-038#X130:1>
There is also talk of developing wireless two-way communication to
execute the buy-sell instructions for share trading.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-038#X131:1>
The attraction is instant confirmation of transaction and price.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-038#X132:1>
On the drawing board are software development efforts to tap the
power of DataRoam for wireless faxing, 2-way messaging, wireless alphanumeric
paging and perhaps even wireless Internet connectivity.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-038#X133:1>
So watch this slot for more news on PDAs. </X> </I>
