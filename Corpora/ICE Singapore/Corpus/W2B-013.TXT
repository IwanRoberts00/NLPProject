<ICE-SIN:W2B-013#3:1>
<h> Chapter 1 : Successful Women - Who are they ? </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-013#4:1>
<h> How Were They Selected? </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-013#5:1>
To write this book I interviewed 32 women in various professions from
both the public and private sectors.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-013#6:1>
They are from the fields of education, law, banking, business,
manufacturing, broking and management consultancy.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-013#7:1>
The selection was based on a reputational survey method, i.e., I asked
people in each profession to identify women whom they considered successful
in their profession.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-013#8:1>
Some names were also obtained through professional associations, and a
couple were visible women whose names were given to me by a journalist.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-013#9:1>
I must state at the outset that I failed to interview a few very
visible and successful women in Singapore because I was " filtered" out by
their secretaries, i.e., their secretaries informed me that they were too
busy to meet me.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-013#10:1>
Where professionals were approached for names, I told them my
definition of success.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-013#11:1>
I define success as having visibility and the ability to function
with some measure of peer recognition.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-013#12:1>
Accordingly, a successful banking officer would be one who is
visible, i.e., known by others in banking or in other professions, and who
holds a position of authority.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-013#13:1>
Her efforts would be recognized by her superiors or peers and she
would enjoy social standing among fellow banking officers.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-013#14:1>
However, nominators, i.e., those who gave me the names, were told
that they may have their own definitions of success.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-013#15:1>
I feel that each one would have certain notions of what success
means, so it seemed unnecessary for me to lay down strict parameters.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-013#16:1>
Besides, my view of success may not be the same as theirs and as this
is an in-depth study into a small sample of what some " knowledgeable" people
in the various professions consider to be successful women, it is important
that these nominators define the term success themselves.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-013#17:1>
Thus the identification of the women was of greater consequence than
all the other reasons of choice.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-013#18:1>
Notwithstanding this, expertise in identifying visible people
requires no great talent or skill ( I ) .

<ICE-SIN:W2B-013#19:1>
In a country as small and as closely knit as Singapore, identifying
the few really successful women in the various professions was not a complex
task.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-013#20:1>
I approached each of these 32 women for an in-dept interview which
lasted for approximately 1-2 hours.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-013#21:1>
Th minimally structured interviews were characterized as " flexible
strategy of discovery...and its object is to carry on a guided conversation
and to elicit rich, detailed materials that can be used for qualitative
analysis" ( 2).

<ICE-SIN:W2B-013#22:1>
One of my aims is to provide opportunities for the women to talk and
tell their stories.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-013#23:1>
As I am interested in the experiences of these successful women, I
have approached the interviews without a strictly structured set of
questions.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-013#24:1>
Instead, I simply ask them to tell their stories, be they about their
families or their work.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-013#25:1>
From the interview data, I was able to sketch a profile of the
successful women.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-013#26:1>
<h> Successful Women - A Profile </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-013#27:1>
In an earlier study on educational administrators in Singapore, I
found that many female administrators were single and had their education in
mission girls' schools, where they actively took part in activities ( 3).

<ICE-SIN:W2B-013#28:1>
I also found out that female administrators as compared to their male
counterparts were more likely to attend in-service courses to update or
upgrade themselves, and therefore they were better qualified as a group than
their male counterparts.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-013#29:1>
Of the 32 successful women interviewed, what common characteristics
do they possess?

<ICE-SIN:W2B-013#30:1>
Can a profile be drawn?

<ICE-SIN:W2B-013#31:1>
I would like to discuss these characteristics under the following
subheadings:

<ICE-SIN:W2B-013#32:1>
1) Some personal data

<ICE-SIN:W2B-013#33:1>
2) Their position in their families

<ICE-SIN:W2B-013#34:1>
3) Their parents

<ICE-SIN:W2B-013#35:1>
4) Their school lives

<ICE-SIN:W2B-013#36:1>
5) Their religious commitment

<ICE-SIN:W2B-013#37:1>
<h> Some Personal Data </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-013#38:1>
The age range of these 32 women spans over two decades.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-013#39:1>
The youngest in the group is 32 while there are three who are in
their 50s.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-013#40:1>
The 18 women from the private sector are young, 13 of them being in
their 30s, four in their early 40s and one in her late 40s.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-013#41:1>
As expected, those in the private sector draw a much higher salary.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-013#42:1>
One who is in her early thirties and who is given perks such as a car
cum driver, membership to a country club and other benefits estimated her
cost to her organization as over
&dollar;200,000 a year.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-013#43:1>
Some of the others interviewed were paid more.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-013#44:1>
Of the 32 women, six are single, one is divorced while another is a
widow.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-013#45:1>
And of the 26 who are married, seven have only one child each.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-013#46:1>
Three have no children, one by choice.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-013#47:1>
She said: If I want a serious career, I don't think I can cope with
it plus children.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-013#48:1>
We ( her husband and herself) always say to ourselves we don't have
children and we don't know what we are missing, but at least we are in
control of what we want to do with our lives.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-013#49:1>
( Partner of a consulting firm, mid 30s)

<ICE-SIN:W2B-013#50:1>
Three of the six single ladies are in their early thirties and while
they are fairly open to marriage prospects, two shared.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-013#51:1>
Marriage doesn't feature high on my list because I'm so comfortable.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-013#52:1>
( Top bank executive, early 30s)

<ICE-SIN:W2B-013#53:1>
Being where I am now does cut me off from some circles.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-013#54:1>
There are many who dare not ask me out.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-013#55:1>
I guess this is something I have to accept.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-013#56:1>
( Businesswoman, early 30s)

<ICE-SIN:W2B-013#57:1>
Thus while some may have chosen to stay single, it may not be so for
the rest of them.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-013#58:1>
Their very position in the organization does place limits on the
number who might be eligible to date them.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-013#59:1>
However, it is of interest to note that Susan Faludi in the latest
best-selling book Backlash in the United States cites a study which shows
that " a college educated single woman at thirty would be more likely to
marry than her counterpart with only a high school diploma".

<ICE-SIN:W2B-013#60:1>
In 1986, the same researcher found that while the marriage rate has
been declining in the general population, for women with four or more years
of college education, the rate has actually risen ( 4), debunking the myth
that the more highly educated and older a woman is, the less chance she has
for marriage.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-013#61:1>
<h> Their Position In The Family </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-013#62:1>
Most of them come from fairly large families of five children or
more.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-013#63:1>
Three are the only child and five have no brothers.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-013#64:1>
Approximately a third of the women are the eldest child in their
families.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-013#65:1>
Quite a number attributed their success in part to being the eldest.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-013#66:1>
Two women said: I'm the eldest ...there are eight of us.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-013#67:1>
I have three brothers and four sisters.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-013#68:1>
They all look up to me and I like to set a good example for them.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-013#69:1>
( Businesswoman, early 30s)

<ICE-SIN:W2B-013#70:1>
I had to look after my siblings.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-013#71:1>
I had to be the role model, the one to get the degree although my
father was a degree holder.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-013#72:1>
( Educator, 40s)

<ICE-SIN:W2B-013#73:1>
Like their counterparts in the West, more than half of the 32 women
are either the only child, or the only daughter or the eldest child in the
family.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-013#74:1>
A study in United Kingdom by Miles found that of 40 top women 60 per
cent were the eldest child and 50 per cent the only daughter in their
families ( 5).

<ICE-SIN:W2B-013#75:1>
While being the eldest seems important, one who is a middle child and
in a family of girls shared.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-013#76:1>
I'm the middle child and I think middle people always have to be more
aggressive to be noticed.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-013#77:1>
I've seen it happen so often.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-013#78:1>
( Top bank executive, early 30s)

<ICE-SIN:W2B-013#79:1>
If they are unique in that they are more often the eldest or only
child or have no brothers, what are their parents like?

<ICE-SIN:W2B-013#80:1>
Are their parents equally successful?

<ICE-SIN:W2B-013#81:1>
Are their parents achievers?

<ICE-SIN:W2B-013#82:1>
What sort of relationship do they have with their families?

<ICE-SIN:W2B-013#83:1>
In the following section we will hear what the 32 women have to say
about their parents.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-013#84:1>
<h> Their Parents </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-013#85:1>
It has often been found that parents of successful women are
especially accomplished in themselves ( 6).

<ICE-SIN:W2B-013#86:1>
The parents are not only supportive but also have high expectations
of their daughters.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-013#87:1>
Mothers are often non-traditional role models.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-013#88:1>
In the interviews, the positive influences of the parents come across
very strongly.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-013#89:1>
Their fathers are often seen as their mentors and their mothers serve
as distinctive role models.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-013#90:1>
Studies in the West have found that mothers who work or are active in
leisure pursuits affect their daughters' aspirations ( 7).

<ICE-SIN:W2B-013#91:1>
This could be that in order to aspire to a career, a young girl needs
role models who can show her how to combine the twin goals of career and
marriage.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-013#92:1>
Women who succeed seem to have enriching families and childhood
experiences, which have given them a wider perspective of adult female roles.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-013#93:1>
These are what two women said about their parents.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-013#94:1>
She is 79 and still drives.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-013#95:1>
She is very hardworking, always learning...and very educated....

<ICE-SIN:W2B-013#96:1>
She became a widow in her 30s and never thought of remarrying.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-013#97:1>
She supported me through university.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-013#98:1>
( Educator, late 40s)

<ICE-SIN:W2B-013#99:1>
My parents are very assertive, particularly my mother.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-013#100:1>
She could be the driving force.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-013#101:1>
Although she was not directly involved in my father's business she
was always behind it.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-013#102:1>
She's involved in the stock market.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-013#103:1>
It's rather unusual but she wanted all the girls to go to university ...

<ICE-SIN:W2B-013#104:1>
she insisted that all three of us get an university education and
her reason is " If you have no education, you'll depend too much on your
husbands".

<ICE-SIN:W2B-013#105:1>
She wanted us to go overseas too.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-013#106:1>
She believes that education abroad broadens your outlook and makes
you independent.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-013#107:1>
( Top bank executive, early 40s)

<ICE-SIN:W2B-013#108:1>
A study by Miles found that her 40 subjects who were top women in
Britain and the United States had good relationships with their parents.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-013#109:1>
They were often " daddy's girl".

<ICE-SIN:W2B-013#110:1>
Eighty-two per cent of her subjects were close to their fathers.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-013#111:1>
It is of no surprise that parents play such a major role in
providing them encouragement and expectation, and being their mentors.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-013#112:1>
But what is least expected is the mention of grandmothers and aunts.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-013#113:1>
My grandmother was a very stoic woman and had a lot of influence on
me.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-013#114:1>
She used to lecture me a lot on manners and the importance of face
saving, self-respect and work.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-013#115:1>
To this day, I feel guilty when I take leave and I try not to, even
when I was hospitalized.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-013#116:1>
Her injunctions are in my mind.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-013#117:1>
All the people who have a big influence in my life are women.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-013#118:1>
( Educator, mid 40s)

<ICE-SIN:W2B-013#119:1>
So it appears that successful women in Singapore have parents who
are achievers and/or who have high expectations of their daughters.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-013#120:1>
It has been suggested that if achievement-oriented parents have no
sons then daughters take the place of sons ( 8).

<ICE-SIN:W2B-013#121:1>
I have only two sisters.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-013#122:1>
My father tends to treat me like a boy and therefore I have more
independence, more responsibilities etc, so I suppose that helped.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-013#123:1>
( Top bank executive, early 30s)

<ICE-SIN:W2B-013#124:1>
My father has Western leanings ...come to think of it he treats me
like a son he never had.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-013#125:1>
He relates more to me.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-013#126:1>
( Partner in a law firm, early 30s)

<ICE-SIN:W2B-013#127:1>
Eight of the women lost their fathers at an early age.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-013#128:1>
For one a painful career change had to be made consequently because
of her responsibility to her family.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-013#129:1>
She was forced to take on leadership roles at an early age and to be
responsible for the family from her teenage years such that: " I felt a
tremendous sense of relief when my younger sister graduated.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-013#130:1>
That was it, after that my life was mine, my time was mine".

<ICE-SIN:W2B-013#131:1>
Because of the factors listed above these women may have received
approval for achievement, a recognition that is otherwise often denied to
women ( 9).

<ICE-SIN:W2B-013#132:1>
There are two who did not have support from their parents and have
succeeded only because they have worked extra hard all these years to be
where they are. <X>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-013#X133:1>
My father also made me work hard and carve a career for myself.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-013#X134:1>
You see when I was completing the 8th standard, I asked if he would
send me abroad if I did well at the 'O' levels. </X> </I>
