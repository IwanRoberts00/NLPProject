<h> RETROSPECTIVE </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-003#2:1>
I was only a child when Singapore had her independence unilaterally
thrust upon her on August 9, 1965.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-003#3:1>
Therefore, I wasn't one of those who mulled over the implications of
Singapore's eviction from Malaysia, succinctly expressed by the bold headline
of The Straits Times the next morning: " Singapore is Out".

<ICE-SIN:W2B-003#4:1>
Having absolutely no idea what political forces were at play, I
neither expected nor noted any radical change to our way of life.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-003#5:1>
To a child, national concerns were the domain of adults and
socio-economic changes, if any, were unobtrusive and took the form of sudden,
surprising discoveries.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-003#6:1>
At some point in time, for instance, I was no longer given any loose
change with the cameo of Elizabeth II or George VI.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-003#7:1>
Dollar notes from the Lunar New Year ang-pow started to bear orchid
motifs.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-003#8:1>
Trips across the Causeway to where my parents' generation still
affectionately referred to as " the Federation" became more cumbersome, with
mandatory stops for passport stamps at artificial barriers called immigration
controls.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-003#9:1>
My sister, who was schooled in a convent with a high proportion of
expatriate children, started to lose friends at a swift, steady pace.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-003#10:1>
I gradually lost sight of the fair-haired Caucasian children laying
on the patios or lawns of the houses and apartments along Dunearn and Bukit
Timah Roads, which I passed daily on my way to and from school.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-003#11:1>
There was also talk and frequent sighs, among the older members of my
family, which was in the pineapple canning business, that these were worrying
times for industries that counted on a unified domestic market encompassing
Singapore and Malaysia.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-003#12:1>
If I had seen our Prime Minister in his moment of anguish, announcing
the collapse of the merger on television, I would not have understood what of
national interest could be at stake.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-003#13:1>
That Singapore's role as a financial, banking and shipping centre for
the Malaysian peninsula was rescinded, that quotas and retaliatory tariffs
were levied as a result of the strained relationship between our country and
her immediate neighbour, that our very survival as a nation was forecast with
doom by the majority of observers on the world stage would have been ideas
alien to a child's perspective.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-003#14:1>

Minister doing the honours via the magnified image of the Jumbotron at the
Singapore Indoor Stadium.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-003#15:1>
It was years later, when I was in a better position to understand the
tensions of 1965, that I marvelled in retrospect at the vision,
determination, and most of all, courage of our leadership.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-003#16:1>
It must have been a tall, almost impossible, order to lead a young
nation devoid of all natural resources, from which the British armed forces (
till then our acknowledged protectors) were withdrawing.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-003#17:1>
The withdrawal of the British forces threatened the precarious basis
of our national defence, which was then represented by two infantry
battalions, one partially mobilized volunteer infantry battalion, a volunteer
artillery regiment, an armoured car squadron, some engineers and signals, a
small auxiliary air arm and a single patrol boat.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-003#18:1>
Over 25,000 local citizens who worked in the British military bases
were faced with unemployment, while the livelihood of thousands more
connected with them was also affected.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-003#19:1>
Furthermore, Singapore's industrialization programme was just
underway, with hordes of young school-leavers joining a labour market which
was fraught with strikes and disputes.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-003#20:1>
What confronted the leadership at that tumultuous point of transition
was a prospect that was daunting and not to be envied by the average person
who operated within narrow confines, by and large unconcerned with an
overview of the state of the nation.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-003#21:1>
This was especially true in the early days of independence when a
collective Singaporean identity remained to be forged, and each man reacted
in his own way to what directly involved him.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-003#22:1>
For example, I remember being particularly pleased by curfews as a
child.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-003#23:1>
Curfews meant not having to go to school.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-003#24:1>
I little realized the dangers of racial riots in a polyglot,
multicultural society aiming towards a secular democracy and communal
integration.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-003#25:1>
The average Singaporean of the mid-1960s had no quarrel with this
first generation of leaders led by Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-003#26:1>
Whatever support marshalled by the main opposition party, the Barisan
Socialis, was essentially limited, and dwindled further after it boycotted
the elections of April 1968.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-003#27:1>
After a time, I no longer noticed election posters with the Barisan "
ring and star" but observed a preponderance of the PAP symbol of a ring
mounted by lightning, which came to symbolize policies that spelled freedom
from discontent, whether this last was expressed as student agitation or
labour disputes.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-003#28:1>
1969 became the first strike-free year after tough new laws were
created to curb labour unrest and establish a climate conducive to
investment.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-003#29:1>
While I used to save my pocket money in little piggy banks provided
by the Chung Khiaw Bank, my parents were soon to open accounts at the
Development Bank of Singapore, which was established, as I was also to
discover years later, to provide financial assistance for manufacturing
industries and take equity in private enterprises in order to get these off
the ground.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-003#30:1>
I associated the years following independence with the adjustment to
new features about Singapore.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-003#31:1>
The name Jurong, which hitherto was synonymous with mangrove forests
in the rural west of the island, became the Jurong Town Corporation.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-003#32:1>
Even though I had not then heard of Dr Albert Winsemius and the
United Nations team who made recommendations for our industrialization
programme after surveying the site, I learnt often enough in school about the
1,600 hectares of wild swampy land that were filled to accommodate a colony
of factories.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-003#33:1>
Naval Base, a name which always stood on the northern tip of the
island in my primary school atlas, became known as Sembawang Shipyard when
the Singapore government inherited all the properties previously occupied by
the British military forces, including this comprehensively equipped naval
dockyard.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-003#34:1>
Meanwhile, our coastline was daily changing as inconsequential
hillocks were levelled and the soil used to reclaim land from the sea along
parts of the stretch from Changi to Pasir Panjang.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-003#35:1>
While I learnt to accept the fact that I could no longer lean over
the parapet at the Esplanade and watch the seawater lap against Queen
Elizabeth Walk, I was also fascinated by the furious pace of construction
which raised high-rise public housing estates at virtually every corner of
Singapore.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-003#36:1>
Satellite towns were renamed new towns and these in turn developed
into towns with their individual character, comprehensive infrastructure of
social amenities and comfortable, lived-in look.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-003#37:1>
While the Housing and Development Board was altering the face of
Singapore's residential estates, the Central Business District was assuming a
dramatic skyline of its own, as hotels and shopping complexes in Orchard Road
competed with office blocks and commercial edifices along Shenton Way for
uniqueness and originality of design and concept.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-003#38:1>
Although some would wax nostalgic over the loss of open-air dining
opportunities in hawker stalls around Hokkien Street, Chinatown or the
Cuppage Road Car Park, they soon welcomed the cleaner, more orderly and
hygienic milieux of hawker centres where the same ambience of economy dining
on local morsels is combined with sanitation and vigorously enforced
standards in food preparation.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-003#39:1>
The same applies to the frequent criticisms, during the first decade
of nationhood, that the finer aspects of our architectural heritage were
being crushed by the relentless bulldozers of urban redevelopment.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-003#40:1>
But the problem was soon redressed when conservation zones such as
Chinatown, Little India and Kampong Glam were established, and old Georgian
terraces in the " Golden Shoe" were restored to their former splendour.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-003#41:1>
One just has to accept the fact that there is a right time for
everything in Singapore.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-003#42:1>
In this case, Singapore can afford to preserve her cultural heritage
after she has ensured that her economy is stabilized and her home-owning
population ranks among the highest in the world.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-003#43:1>
On the most banal level, the impact of urban renewal meant for me
that flooding along Bukit Timah Road after torrential downpours was
alleviated by an improved network of drainage canals.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-003#44:1>
Among my vivid memories of the late 1960s is that of my brother
reporting for National Service.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-003#45:1>
After legislation was passed in 1967 requiring all males at eighteen
to serve two years with the Singapore Armed Forces as part of a long-term
plan for national security adopted by the Ministry of Interior and Defence (
later Ministry of Defence), my brother was duly recruited.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-003#46:1>
I remember the send-off party to which the family was invited, full
of anxious-looking parents and fidgety young men unsure of what lay ahead.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-003#47:1>
Although my brother often moaned about the discipline and the
rigorous training, he recognized their positive effects and would eventually
look back on those couple of years as character-building ones, when he also
made many enduring friendships with people from different races and walks of
life.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-003#48:1>
Growing up in Singapore during her first twenty-five years of
independence was also about campaigns.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-003#49:1>
Art classes in school were spent designing posters to disseminate
various messages: " Keep Singapore clean, green and mosquito free", prompted
by an Environmental Health Act of 1968; " Stop at two", promulgated the
Family Planning and Population Board, successor to the voluntary Singapore
Family Planning Association of the 1950s; " Use your hands", " Be courteous",
" Speak Mandarin", to reinforce the importance, respectively, of
self-sufficiency, civic-consciousness and awareness of ethnic roots.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-003#50:1>
And so I learnt to watch Hong Kong television dramas dubbed in
Mandarin, wore " Smiley" badges and held the door for my neighbours.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-003#51:1>
It has often been said that Singapore is extraordinarily fortunate,
in having eight years of boom conditions after her independence, when even
the American involvement in the Vietnam War boosted her role as a supplies
centre, while conflict in the Middle East led to an equal demand for
ship-repair facilities.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-003#52:1>
To me, such an observation, though historically grounded, smacks of
sour grapes.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-003#53:1>
For where does one draw the fine line between a propitious set of
circumstances and the foresight and determination to capitalize on it?

<ICE-SIN:W2B-003#54:1>
I echo what our Prime Minister said in his talk at the National
University of Singapore on 23 July 1990, when I assert that we made happen
all we have today.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-003#55:1>
If anything characterizes the resourcefulness of Singapore and her
people, it is the flexibility of response accompanied by an accessibility to
change.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-003#56:1>
When rapprochement occurred between Washington and Moscow, and the
subsequent entry of the Peoples' Republic of China into the United Nations
led to lesser antipathy between the superpowers, Singapore saw the need for
regional cooperation between the smaller nations.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-003#57:1>
When she decided to exploit the strategic position of her deep-water
port, Singapore enhanced her shipbuilding and ship-repair facilities, set up
her own register of local ships, provided tax free registration for foreign
ships, launched a national shipping line, the Neptune Orient Lines, and
created a National Shippers' Council to shatter the monopoly held by the Far
Eastern Freight Conference, which was till then dominated by old European
shipping lines.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-003#58:1>
When the national birthrate fell below replacement level by the
mid-1980s, a dire prospect for our nation's labour or defence forces in the
near future, Singapore started a vigorous campaign to encourage young people
to marry earlier and have more children, for the purpose of which a special
Social Development Unit was set up.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-003#59:1>
These are but the most obvious examples of our readiness to grasp
opportunities or effect solutions.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-003#60:1>
From the lessons of the past we have learnt to watch our steps, take
necessary action and not take too much for granted.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-003#61:1>
This is again proven by a random survey of our feats during the last
twenty-five years.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-003#62:1>
Asian values of piety and fidelity were advocated when economic
progress was ineluctably tagged by growing materialism.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-003#63:1>
Tax holidays for foreign investors were provided to encourage them to
set up pioneer industries.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-003#64:1>
Rigidly enforced laws against corruption make Singapore a clean
society in both the literal and figurative aspects.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-003#65:1>
" Group representation constituencies" give equal provision to
minority races and ensure that these are not knowingly undersold or
neglected. <X>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-003#X66:1>
The list is endless.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-003#X67:1>
And on this twenty-fifth year, the tangible results of success and
social prosperity are pervasive.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-003#X68:1>
We deserve to be proud.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-003#X69:1>
We have paid our dues and earned our right to celebrate. </X> </I>
