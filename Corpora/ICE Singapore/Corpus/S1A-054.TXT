<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#43:1:B>
Then some of them are quite long

<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#44:1:B>
So you just slice it

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#45:1:A>
And then

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#46:1:B>
It doesn't matter when we just put a few here and there

<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#48:1:B>
I got very sick of it

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#49:1:A>
When you eat too much you get sick of it

<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#50:1:A>
But once in a long long time

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#51:1:B>
After making uh

<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#52:1:A>

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#53:1:B>
At night uh I couldn't eat dinner you know

<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#54:1:B>
When I was eating dinner I feel like throwing out

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#55:1:A>

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#76:1:B>

<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#77:1:B>
Don't know maybe because I don't cook very often

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#78:1:A>
I don't cook at all

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#79:1:B>

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#83:1:A>

<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#84:1:B>
Ya we take turns lah

<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#85:1:B>

<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#86:1:A>

<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#87:1:B>
One day we rotate lah

<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#88:1:B>

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#97:1:B>
Rice

<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#98:1:B>
Usually we just cook two dishes one meat one vegie

<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#99:1:B>
Then maybe sometimes we have soup

<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#100:1:B>
But usually if we cook soup we put the meat inside so we still
have about two dishes

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#101:1:A>
Oh then chin chye eat lah

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#102:1:B>

<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#107:1:B>
We are trying to save money

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#108:1:A>
Not only that a lot of time you have to you know

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#109:1:B>
Ya

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#110:1:A>
Actually you don't need that much

<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#111:1:A>
For me uh I I just fry an egg

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#112:1:B>

<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#113:1:A>

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#114:1:B>
Ya

<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#115:1:B>
My household they don't really like to eat eggs

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#116:1:A>
Oh I love eggs

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#117:1:B>
Ah for me also second year I always cook eggs

<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#121:1:B>
Ya ya I love eggs

<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#122:1:B>

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#123:1:A>
Anyway when nobody's at home right I just make egg

<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#124:1:A>
So easy

<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#125:1:A>
It's the easiest dish

<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#126:1:A>
Anyway when you cook noodle you throw an egg inside

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#127:1:B>
Ya ya I throw an egg inside

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#128:1:A>
Eat with bread

<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#129:1:A>
You you get me hard boil egg as well

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#130:1:B>
Aye I like I like egg sandwiches

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#131:1:A>
I like I like too

<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#132:1:A>
Aye one day we make ah

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#133:1:B>
Egg

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#134:1:A>
I think we should do it because every breakfast is you gotta
spend a lot of money

<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#135:1:A>
Or you say that once in a while we eat it's okay but having here
and there I think

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#136:1:B>
Quickly makes up

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#137:1:A>
And in and we remove it high it can be quite expensive

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#138:1:B>
Ya that is true

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#139:1:A>
Then you order a drink everyday

<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#140:1:A>
So I think when he ask me about stationery as you were saying up
we should we both should do it together because then I won't leave or
anything

<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#141:1:A>
I think we should have a pantry

<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#142:1:A>
Pantry most important

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#143:1:B>
We need a fridge

<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#144:1:B>
No get those small fridge

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#145:1:A>
Ya lah small fridge

<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#146:1:A>
But even so I don't know okay

<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#147:1:A>
I think we should agree not in any need of fridge

<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#148:1:A>
I think we need a little bit of <unclear> word </unclear> not oven

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#149:1:B>
Oven-toaster

<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#150:1:B>
Toaster

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#151:1:A>
Not toaster

<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#152:1:A>
Bread-toaster

<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#153:1:A>
That type you know just heat up a little bit of food

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#154:1:B>
Ya bread-toaster lor

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#155:1:A>
Don't you think not not bread-toaster

<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#156:1:A>
Bread-toaster

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#157:1:B>
Oven-toaster lah

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#158:1:A>
Is just for bread

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#159:1:B>
Ya ya ya those oven-toaster

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#160:1:A>
Ah oven-toaster

<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#161:1:A>
I think we should you know

<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#162:1:A>
It's very practical

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#163:1:B>
But I think we we don't yet slowly lah

<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#164:1:B>
We get the more essential things first

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#165:1:A>
Fridge is it

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#166:1:B>
Fridge

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#167:1:A>
Fridge is important

<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#168:1:A>
We can store things inside

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#169:1:B>
Ya but

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#170:1:A>
Like you put your fruits you bring from home

<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#171:1:A>
You put your fruits

<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#172:1:A>
You throw inside then then

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#173:1:B>
But not in a hurry

<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#174:1:B>
Yet we get the other things first like the desk and all that first

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#175:1:A>
We need only one more desk

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#176:1:B>
One desk

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#177:1:A>
Then chair

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#178:1:B>
What chair

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#179:1:A>
Chair

<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#180:1:A>
We don't need a chair

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#181:1:B>
Don't need ah

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#182:1:A>
There can

<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#183:1:A>
You see we got four chairs here already what

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#184:1:B>
Okay lor

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#185:1:A>
Okay this desk is Boon

<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#186:1:A>
That one is for me

<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#187:1:A>
Yours will be the same one

<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#188:1:A>
All three of ours three of us should get the same chairs and
tables

<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#189:1:A>
Of course he will have this big chair

<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#190:1:A>
If he wants to get another table he should get a bigger one for
himself

<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#191:1:A>
At least both of us share the kind of table

<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#192:1:A>
Then there won't be some kind of discrepancy

<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#193:1:A>
This one will be for this computer like when you are not at your
desk working you want to go to the computer you move the computer

<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#194:1:A>
Okay so we need another desk we need

<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#195:1:A>
I think we need two cupboards

<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#196:1:A>
Ah how many cupboards do you think we need

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#197:1:B>
I think at the moment we don't need more than one cabinet
because he hasn't finished using this one you see

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#198:1:A>
He has quite a lot of things already

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#199:1:B>
Really

<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#200:1:B>
I think he needs to clear because he has a lot of repeated and all
those brochures and everything

<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#201:1:B>
All repeated

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#202:1:A>
I'm never dare to touch

<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#203:1:A>
I I mean at least Jason help him to

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#204:1:B>
Maybe he has uh ya some kind of cabinet lah

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#205:1:A>
Just now do you realise he was looking around for something

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#206:1:B>
Is it

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#207:1:A>
You won't believe it

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#208:1:B>
No

<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#209:1:B>
He need something for storing his film

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#210:1:A>
I don't know what kind of

<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#211:1:A>
You need a special cabinet

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#212:1:B>
But how long does the film last ha

<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#213:1:B>
Does it expire after a while

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#214:1:A>
You keep it properly it can last

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#215:1:B>
It can last ah

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#216:1:A>
Look at the way he has kept

<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#217:1:A>
It's it's expose to light most of the time and this thing rub up
and down

<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#218:1:A>
I I think it's personally that he need a big cabinet

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#219:1:B>
Oh

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#220:1:A>
So we need a film cabinet

<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#221:1:A>
Even we don't have a cabinet

<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#222:1:A>
We can buy those kind of bags

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#223:1:B>
Bags

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#224:1:A>
Big bag then you just put inside

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#225:1:B>
I thought of buying boxes

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#226:1:A>
Box can lah

<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#227:1:A>
Box can

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#228:1:B>
Boxes

<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#229:1:B>
Ikea boxes

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#230:1:A>
Okay okay

<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#231:1:A>
Okay then we get another of this cabinet

<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#232:1:A>
Do you want to get this type

<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#233:1:A>
This looks very ugly

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#234:1:B>
But it's basic

<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#235:1:B>
This is the standard office cabinet

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#236:1:A>
I think for both of us we need some kind of cupboard also
right

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#237:1:B>
For our own

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#238:1:A>
Do we

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#239:1:B>
No lah we

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#240:1:A>
Come out ah

<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#241:1:A>
Our thing will start piling out on the table already

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#242:1:B>
Ya you need files

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#243:1:A>
We need some kind of files filing system for our own lah

<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#244:1:A>
No

<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#245:1:A>
When you start carrying a lot of things like you send your
graphics everything instead of having like maybe yours we have a carrier and
the other one the thing is you need to systematically keep

<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#246:1:A>
You can't just store up here know

<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#247:1:A>
Look at mine

<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#248:1:A>
I mean I've been trying my best to keep it clean then he comes and
he meddle up all over again

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#249:1:B>
Ya that's true

<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#250:1:B>
My previous office we have a lot of files one on the table

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#251:1:A>
I think we should

<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#252:1:A>
But here no file no no ta

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#253:1:B>
No files

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#254:1:A>
What I mean files on the table

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#255:1:B>
Oh files on the table <unclear> word </unclear>

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#256:1:A>
I think we should get those types of shelf

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#257:1:B>
Shelves ah

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#258:1:A>
We should

<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#259:1:A>
We can maximise space that way you know

<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#260:1:A>
Think that shelf you can you put a few file

<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#261:1:A>
Then put one on top there so it looks really it looks like it's
part of the desk

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#262:1:B>
That looks like your bedroom

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#263:1:A>
No you can

<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#264:1:A>
I don't know whether he'll allow if we put shelves

<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#265:1:A>
Shelves maximise space

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#266:1:B>
But for us it's very unoffice like you know

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#267:1:A>
Really

<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#268:1:A>
If we can make it very cosy

<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#269:1:A>
When do we have to be office like

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#270:1:B>
Ya

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#271:1:A>
What's more

<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#272:1:A>
We're advertising agency you know

<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#273:1:A>
So it must be as creative as possible

<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#274:1:A>
When I went to Weli ads right it was so cute you know

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#275:1:B>

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#276:1:A>
The receptionist sits at this little room where you first go
in right

<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#277:1:A>
Then they have this banana tree

<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#278:1:A>
Fake banana tree and a monkey

<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#279:1:A>
Big look quite big

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#280:1:B>

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#281:1:A>
The monkey's quite quite tall lah

<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#282:1:A>
Up to here

<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#283:1:A>
Then they have a little treasure box

<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#284:1:A>
You open up right then they throw their stuff there

<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#285:1:A>
But it's like a treasure box so it's very cute

<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#286:1:A>
Then it's a shophouse so you walk up

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#287:1:B>
Oh that's cute

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#288:1:A>
Walk up right with a winding

<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#289:1:A>
Then you walk up

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#290:1:B>

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#291:1:A>
Then they have this lounge not they call it a lounge right

<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#292:1:A>
You sit around and they have meeting there and the table uh is
cane you know

<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#293:1:A>

<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#294:1:A>
It's cane

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#295:1:B>
Actually I think we should standardise all cane

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#296:1:A>
And and the chair

<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#297:1:A>
We require all cane you know

<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#298:1:A>
It's all very nice

<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#299:1:A>
And then it's quite cosy

<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#300:1:A>
And then you have a little bar counter

<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#301:1:A>
Don't know why

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-054#302:1:B>

counter so it's high pi <unclear> word </unclear> high chair you know
