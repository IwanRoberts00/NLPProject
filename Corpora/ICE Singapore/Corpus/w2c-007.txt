<h> Woman fined for driving with twin sister's IC and licence </h>

By Tan Ooi Boon

<ICE-SIN:W2C-007#3:1>
A WOMAN who did not have a driving licence thought she could fool the
police by driving with her twin sister's identity card and licence.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-007#4:1>
But what she did not count on was the police receiving earlier
information on the ploy and setting a trap for her.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-007#5:1>
Yesterday, Lim Yan Peng 21, was fined a total of
&dollar;7,000 and banned from driving for a year after she pleaded guilty to using
her sister's identity card and driving licence illegally, driving her car
without permission, driving without a licence and driving without insurance
coverage.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-007#6:1>
Under the law, a car insurance policy is not in force if the driver
does not have a valid licence.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-007#7:1>
The court heard that on May 17, Traffic Police Corporal Jimmy Tiew,
acting on a tip-off, waited outside Yan Peng's flat in Bukit Batok at about
6.40 am.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-007#8:1>
At about 8 am, he saw Yan Peng driving her sister's car and he trailed
her on his motorcycle.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-007#9:1>
When they reached Hillview Avenue, the officer stopped her and asked
for her particulars.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-007#10:1>
Yan Peng showed him the licence and identity card of her twin sister,
Miss Lim Yan Li.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-007#11:1>
The two sisters are not identical twins, but bear a resemblance to
each other.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-007#12:1>
Cpl Tiew then called the Traffic Operations Room and had the identity
card screened.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-007#13:1>
He was instructed to bring the driver to the station.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-007#14:1>
During questioning later, Yan Peng, who works in an electronic
company, admitted that she had driven illegally using her sister's licence
and identity card as she was late for work that day.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-007#15:1>
Her sister, who was unaware of the incident, was away on an overseas
business trip.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-007#16:1>
Yesterday, Yan Peng told The Straits Times that she was Remorseful.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-007#17:1>
She said: " I am glad it is all over now.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-007#18:1>
But I just hope that the case will not affect my sister's career as
she was innocent and knew nothing about this".

<ICE-SIN:W2C-007#19:1>
Miss Lim Yan Li was in court yesterday to help her sister pay the
fines, but refused to comment. </I>

<h> Black-market tickets may be fakes, say concert promoters </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2C-007#21:2>
by Dominic Nathan

<ICE-SIN:W2C-007#22:2>
FIRST it was ticket scalpers.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-007#23:2>
Now promoters of the Michael Jackson concert are warning fans about
the possibility of fake tickets.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-007#24:2>
Said a spokesman for the joint promoters, Lushington Entertainment
and Sunvic Productions: " The public is strongly advised to purchase tickets
only from Sistic counters as security measures are factored into these
original tickets".

<ICE-SIN:W2C-007#25:2>
The joint promoters declined to elaborate on the problem and
continued to keep mum on another issue_a breakdown of the 60,000 public
tickets according to the price range.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-007#26:2>
But sources said that the promoters, faced with criticism of the
initial preferential selling scheme under American Express and a growing
black-market situation, are considering holding a third show.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-007#27:2>
The promoters declined to comment on this.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-007#28:2>
In response to reports that
&dollar;200 tickets were going for
&dollar;400 on the black market, the promoters would only say: " We assure the
public that over 60,000 tickets for both nights across all categories will
still be available when public sales open".

<ICE-SIN:W2C-007#29:2>
No date was given for the sale of tickets to the public, but the
promoters said that details will be announced shortly.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-007#30:2>
The promoters also warned members of the public not to purchase any
tickets from touts.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-007#31:2>
In a statement, the joint promoters said: " Members of the public
should not purchase any tickets from touts who are presently selling tickets
at blackmarket rates as this puts both buyer and seller in criminal
violation".

<ICE-SIN:W2C-007#32:2>
A spokesman for the Customs and Excise Department said it was
monitoring the situation.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-007#33:2>
Under the law, reselling tickets and knowingly buying them is an
offence, regardless of whether they are sold at the same price or at a profit
and to whom they are sold.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-007#34:2>
The offence carries a fine of
&dollar;500. 

<ICE-SIN:W2C-007#35:2>
Some 90,000 tickets, priced at
&dollar;200,
&dollar;125 and
&dollar;65, are available for the concert, scheduled for Aug 29 and 30 at the
National Stadium.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-007#36:2>
Under an arrangement with the show's joint promoters, American
Express started selling tickets exclusively to its card members last
Wednesday.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-007#37:2>
All the
&dollar;200 and
&dollar;125 tickets were snapped up in three days.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-007#38:2>
There was no limit on the number of tickets each cardholder could
purchase.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-007#39:2>
Card members in Indonesia and Malaysia were also allowed to buy
tickets through the priority booking system.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-007#40:2>
This led to fans complaining that there would not be enough good
seats left for the public.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-007#41:2>
Audience will be invited to join N-Day marchpast Also new is sea
display by civilian craft, naval divers by Dominic Nathan THE first
interactive National Day Parade - this is what this year's 28th National Day
Parade promises.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-007#42:2>
Some 20,000 spectators at the Padang will literally be part of the
action during the event as they will be invited to come down off the stands
and onto the Padang to take the pledge and sing the national anthem.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-007#43:2>
They will then stage their very own marchpast in front of the
President and other VIPs.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-007#44:2>
This segment, aptly called Nation on Parade, will be the highlight of
the event, which has " My Singapore, My Home" as its theme.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-007#45:2>
A novel sea display is also planned for the parade, which will
include the normal ceremonial and display segments.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-007#46:2>
At a press briefing on the overview of the parade concept, the
chairman of the event's executive committee, Lieutenant-Colonel Lee Boon Loi,
said:

<ICE-SIN:W2C-007#47:2>
" This year's parade will be truly a 'people's parade' as we take the
concept of audience participation a step further by bringing them into the
thick of things on the Padang itself." The parade, which will start at 5.45
pm on Aug 9, is being organised by the Headquarters of the 8th Singapore
Armoured Brigade.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-007#48:2>
Lt-Col Lee, who is also Chief of Staff of the Singapore Armed Forces'
3rd Division, outlined the other three main segments of the parade: The
traditional ceremonial segment: Designed to be simple yet solemn, this
segment will include the march-past and guard-of honour review by the
President.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-007#49:2>
Aside from the military contingents, there will be Police, Civil
Defence and school uniformed groups taking part.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-007#50:2>
Providing the aerial action will be 20 Commando parachutists and four
Air Force jets which will stage a flypast before breaking into bombburst
formation.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-007#51:2>
The display segment: This will involve 450 school children and
another 2,100 athletes, including SEA Games sportsmen.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-007#52:2>
They will depict, through dance and music, the parade's foundation
theme - " Sound Education and Good Health in a Clean Environment".

<ICE-SIN:W2C-007#53:2>
The sea display segment: This will take the spectators from the
Padang to the Marina Bay area.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-007#54:2>
Fast-paced action will be provided by all types of seacraft, from
power boats and jet skis to canoes and dragon boats.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-007#55:2>
Navy divers will also be dropped into the bay by helicopters in a
mock rescue operation.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-007#56:2>
Floats, fireworks and a light-up of all the seacraft and buildings in
the surrounding area will bring the parade to its close.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-007#57:2>
This will be followed by music and dancing during the post-parade
party.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-007#58:2>
A multi-million dollar industry in songbirds by Dominic Nathan
SINGAPORE imported 1.4 million birds last year, and they were not the kind
that end up in the curry.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-007#59:2>
They were mainly songbirds and other exotic species, and only 30,000
of them were re-exported.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-007#60:2>
This means that 1.1 million birds ended up as pets in homes or are
waiting to be sold in bird shops here.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-007#61:2>
With about 700,000 households in Singapore, this works out to an
average of about 1.5 birds to each Singapore home.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-007#62:2>
Primary Production Department figures showed that the bird trade here
was worth
&dollar;8 million last year.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-007#63:2>
A PPD spokesman said that in addition to the sale of birds, there is
a
&dollar;70 million industry dealing in cages, feed, medication and other
bird-keeping accessories.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-007#64:2>
The
&dollar;8 million, however, refers to the wholesale value of the birds.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-007#65:2>
The retail trade carried out in bird shops across the island will be
worth several times more.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-007#66:2>
Songbird hatchlings, which carry wholesale prices of
&dollar;3 to
&dollar;5, go for about
&dollar;10 to
&dollar;20 apiece at pet shops.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-007#67:2>
A proven contest winner, however, may be worth about
&dollar;500, and a blue-blooded champion songster, like a merbok, can fetch up to
&dollar;100,000. 

<ICE-SIN:W2C-007#68:2>
Although no official figures are available, it is estimated
that more than 80 per cent of the birds imported by the 88 licensed bird
dealers here are songbirds.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-007#69:2>
Bird keeping, especially of songbirds, is a popular pastime here,
With many bird-singing corners in housing estates.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-007#70:2>
According to the PPD, the 10 most popular birds imported here last
Year were: the Spotted Munia, White-headed Munia, Budgerigar, Yellow-Crowned
Bulbul, Zebra Dove, Black-headed Munia, Cockatiel, Hill Mynah, Pekin Robin
and the Java Sparrow.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-007#71:2>
Aside from importing birds, some traders here have also turned to
captive breeding as an alternative source of supply.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-007#72:2>
Budgerigars, cockatiels, rosellas, canaries and other bird species
are now being bred in large numbers and have even replaced the demand for
birds caught in the wild. </I>

<h> Dispute over trade in endangered wildlife </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2C-007#75:3>
Protected birds can be found in Singapore shops: Kwan <h> Records of

<ICE-SIN:W2C-007#76:3>
By Dominic Nathan

<ICE-SIN:W2C-007#77:3>
EXPORT of the popular song bird, Mata-Puteh, is banned in Malaysia.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-007#78:3>
Trade in the Red-Whiskered Bulbul is not allowed in Thailand.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-007#79:3>
But they can still be found in bird shops in Singapore.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-007#80:3>
Evidence of trade here in protected species has been tracked down and
recorded by the international wildlife monitoring agency, Traffic Southeast
Asia, based in Kuala Lumpur.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-007#81:3>
Mr Robert Kwan, chairman of the National Council on the Environment,
presented these findings to The Straits Times on Friday.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-007#82:3>
He was backing his earlier claims that Singapore was a transhipment
centre in the illegal trade of endangered wildlife.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-007#83:3>
The Primary Production Department ( PPD) had asked Mr Kwan to
substantiate his claim.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-007#84:3>
It maintained that illegal trade is not a problem here - Singapore's
record on wildlife trade control is among the best in the world.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-007#85:3>
In presenting his evidence, Mr Kwan also said that Singapore needs to
introduce wider laws and plug existing legal loopholes to prevent protected
species from being traded here.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-007#86:3>
He said that while the PPD is doing an excellent job in fulfilling
Singapore's obligations under the Convention on International Trade in
Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora ( Cites) more needs to be done.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-007#87:3>
He said: " Further legislation is required to support changing
regional and international efforts at protecting trade in endangered and
threatened wildlife".

<ICE-SIN:W2C-007#88:3>
Citing another Traffic finding, he said that Indonesia listed only 46
species of birds as being approved for export.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-007#89:3>
However, a survey of 46 bird shops here last year and this year found
at least 150 species of native Indonesian birds being traded here.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-007#90:3>
Traffic Southeast Asia is part of the Worldwide Traffic Network,
which is supported by the World Wildlife Fund and the International Union for
Conservation of Nature.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-007#91:3>
It monitors trade in and the utilisation of wild plants and animals
in co-operation with the Cites Secretariat.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-007#92:3>
The Council on the Environment, a voluntary non-governmental
organisation, was formed in November 1990 to help the Government transform
Singapore into a green city.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-007#93:3>
In a statement to the council, Mr Stephen Nash, director of Traffic
Southeast Asia said: " Singapore is an important gateway in Asia and illegal
trade does occur.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-007#94:3>
The fact that Singapore authorities continue to foil smuggling
attempts is proof of this".

<ICE-SIN:W2C-007#95:3>
He said that although Singapore is making a sincere and concerted
effort to stop the smuggling, there is a grey area about what is legal and
illegal here.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-007#96:3>
He explained that much of Singapore's trade in parrots involves
importing and re-exporting birds from Indonesia.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-007#97:3>
A check of bird shops here last year showed that 33 of 45 Indonesian
parrot species traded here did not conform with Indonesian export quotas.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-007#98:3>
This technical1y violates Cites.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-007#99:3>
Singapore should not have accepted the birds even if they had
seemingly valid export permits, said Mr Nash.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-007#100:3>
Another legal technicality highlighted by Mr Nash involved birds
leaving their country of origin illegally without proper export
documentation. <X>

<ICE-SIN:W2C-007#X101:3>
After only a short period of quarantine here, however, they are
considered to be imported legally.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-007#X102:3>
He said: " This is a serious loophole which can easily be abused".

<ICE-SIN:W2C-007#X103:3>
Mr Kwan said the council is willing to work with the PPD and other
relevant authorities to help strengthen existing laws protecting wildlife and
the interests of the legitimate trade and the pet bird enthusiast. </X> </I>
