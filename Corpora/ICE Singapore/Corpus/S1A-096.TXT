Now uh I agree uh

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-096#103:1:B>
How were the reviews of the <unclear> word </unclear> so far

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-096#104:1:C>
Okay lah so far

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-096#105:1:B>
I enjoyed the show yesterday uh

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-096#106:1:C>
Huh

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-096#107:1:B>
I thought it was quite good yesterday

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-096#108:1:C>
Ya okay lah

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-096#109:1:B>
Ya

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-096#110:1:C>
so far it's been positive because there are some people can't
make the link

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-096#111:1:B>
Orh orh orh

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-096#112:1:C>
Ya

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-096#113:1:B>
I don't know what the link is lah but I assume it was trying
to show that if your foundation not strong in both cases you will collapse or
something like that

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-096#114:1:C>
Uhm that that that can also

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-096#115:1:B>
Ya

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-096#116:1:C>
And some you will have someone that is uh the strong will
survive

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-096#117:1:B>
Ya you know ya there are so many ya

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-096#118:1:C>
<unclear> word </unclear> someone to link

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-096#119:1:B>
I just want to see the parallel between the two situations
lah

<ICE-SIN:S1A-096#120:1:B>
Ya a lot of people left without realising what happened

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-096#121:1:C>
No but uhm what we actually we haven't yet experiment
experimented as in asking people two days later

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-096#122:1:B>
Uhm uhm

<ICE-SIN:S1A-096#123:1:B>
You need sometime for it to sink in

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-096#124:1:C>
<unclear> word </unclear> Ya lah I told uh we I don't know
yet

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-096#125:1:B>
Ya

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-096#126:1:C>
If they can come to a realization two days later

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-096#127:1:B>
Ya

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-096#128:1:C>
they can still find for me because

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-096#129:1:B>
Ya

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-096#130:1:C>
As you're watching it it's just <unclear> word </unclear>

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-096#131:1:B>
Ya it may because you're too engrossed with the show right
and everything else in it you know

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-096#132:1:C>
Ya ya you still don't want them to make the analysis then

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-096#133:1:B>
Correct ya

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-096#134:1:C>
But I don't know you see

<ICE-SIN:S1A-096#135:1:C>
Actually it's basically what we're trying to put in of course is
entrapment

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-096#136:1:B>
Entrapment nuh

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-096#137:1:C>
Ya because getting uh because we're thinking of re-staging
it so what we want made clearer

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-096#138:1:B>
Uhm

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-096#139:1:C>
Could be the the you know that the trap lah because <unclear>
word </unclear> physically trapped and uh Kim Kim is trapped by
Singaporeanness

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-096#140:1:B>
Oh I see <unclear> word </unclear>

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-096#141:1:C>
<unclear> word </unclear> she got to pay for <unclear> word
</unclear>

<ICE-SIN:S1A-096#142:1:C>
I got to go

<ICE-SIN:S1A-096#143:1:C>
I can't

<ICE-SIN:S1A-096#144:1:C>
The difficulty of letting go the

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-096#145:1:B>
Ya

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-096#146:1:C>
you know Alan breaking free going

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-096#147:1:B>
Correct ya

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-096#148:1:C>
Ranching going out of the house etcetera

<ICE-SIN:S1A-096#149:1:C>
All a lot of uh and the idea of uh uh death

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-096#150:1:B>
Uhm

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-096#151:1:C>
Father's death that traps her growth

<ICE-SIN:S1A-096#152:1:C>
The the the people death that <unclear> word </unclear>

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-096#153:1:B>
Ya

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-096#154:1:C>
Taxes lah in life in in living in Singapore also maybe nuh
being trapped by your job uh and you can't <unclear> word </unclear>

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-096#155:1:B>
Ya

<ICE-SIN:S1A-096#156:1:B>
You know actually I think the play itself has a lot to offer

<ICE-SIN:S1A-096#157:1:B>
I'm I'm glad you're you're planning to re-stage it lah

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-096#158:1:C>
Ya

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-096#159:1:B>
I think too many of these plays here get done once and then
get shelved and not you know not done again nuh

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-096#160:1:C>
Uhm

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-096#161:1:B>
It's a pity Ya

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-096#162:1:C>
So we must get the audience who can share

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-096#163:1:B>
Uhm

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-096#164:1:C>
After that we you know see how lah see how which part we want

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-096#165:1:B>
Okay lah

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-096#166:1:C>
More you know which part because you know the part where they
they caught and Jean cried out then you know I will die then I can walk
through <unclear> word </unclear>

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-096#167:1:B>
Ya correct ya

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-096#168:1:C>
You see and so tonight we're going to uh we're make we're
making Jean say that earlier

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-096#169:1:B>
Oh

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-096#170:1:C>
because as the overlay takes place

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-096#171:1:B>
Uhm uhm

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-096#172:1:C>
Uh audience gets caught up with the effect rather than the
content you see

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-096#173:1:B>
I see

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-096#174:1:C>
So we want to put that earlier uh slightly earlier

<ICE-SIN:S1A-096#175:1:C>
When the <unclear> word </unclear>

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-096#176:1:B>
Ya correct

<ICE-SIN:S1A-096#177:1:B>
That line is often left I mean it loses its impact

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-096#178:1:C>
Ya

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-096#179:1:B>
Ya correct

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-096#180:1:C>
So maybe it is not that the maybe it's a bit of the script a
bit of the delivery

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-096#181:1:B>
Uhm uhm uhm

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-096#182:1:C>
so you <unclear> word </unclear> with testing the the script
out

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-096#183:1:B>
Ya I think this' the best time to test whatever you want to
do right huh

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-096#184:1:B>
Fairly experimental at the moment

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-096#185:1:C>
Ya

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-096#186:1:B>
Ya

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-096#187:1:C>
<unclear> word </unclear>

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-096#188:1:B>
But I like I like the show lah

<ICE-SIN:S1A-096#189:1:B>
I I thought it was quite well produced

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-096#190:1:C>
Ya

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-096#191:1:B>
<unclear> word </unclear> the effect

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-096#192:1:C>
The first night my god the audience

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-096#193:1:B>
I know

<ICE-SIN:S1A-096#194:1:B>
Wan Hui was telling me the audience were were they were laughing
at every line

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-096#195:1:C>
Tuesday was a more you know more intelligent audience

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-096#196:1:B>
Ya

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-096#197:1:C>
because they followed the play

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-096#198:1:B>
Ah

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-096#199:1:C>
The first night they even laughed at the Singlish

<$B>

So they were impressed they did ya

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-096#207:1:C>
Is it

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-096#208:1:B>
Ya

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-096#209:1:C>
What did we do

<ICE-SIN:S1A-096#210:1:C>
We didn't know about the feedback lah

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-096#211:1:B>
Uh because some <unclear> word </unclear> I was walking out
they were talking to me because they knew I was working
