Re: Instructions on filling out claims form

<ICE-SIN:W2D-005#6:1>
In order to facilitate payment of part-time teaching claims, I would
like all claim forms submitted to be standardised.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-005#7:1>
Please note the following:

<ICE-SIN:W2D-005#8:1>
1) When there is more than one page ( e.g. 5 pages), please indicate
the page by writing 1/5, 2/5 ...... 5/5 at the bottom of each page.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-005#9:1>
2) Please do not sign on every page - initial on each page and sign
only on the last one.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-005#10:1>
3) If the claim is for one course only, write only one grand total of
all hours taught on the last page only.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-005#11:1>
4) The personal information ( that is, name, bank details) should be
written on every page.

<ICE-SIN:W2D-005#12:1>
Attached are two samples of completed claim forms. I would appreciate
your adhering to the format of the samples as incomplete or incorrect forms
will result in delays in payments. </I>
