<h> Teachers' working conditions to be improved: MOE </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2C-004#3:1>
By Leong Chan Teik

<ICE-SIN:W2C-004#4:1>
THE Education Ministry will take several measures to improve the
working conditions of teachers in response to feedback gathered from them.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-004#5:1>
It will provide teachers with more support staff to take care of
non-teaching needs.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-004#6:1>
It will also air-condition school staff rooms.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-004#7:1>
Elaborating on the report of a 1991 survey which it circulated to
teachers last week, the ministry said that there was an on-going programme to
build new schools with more facilities and to upgrade existing school]s.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-004#8:1>
It said the Finance Ministry had approved the air-conditioning of
selected areas such as staff rooms in all schools with effect from this year.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-004#9:1>
Teachers will not have to wait long for the installation.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-004#10:1>
The ministry said it would also set up more channels of communication
as it now had infrequent contact with teachers.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-004#11:1>
It also addressed another perennial complaint of teachers that they
have to do chores unrelated to their professional duties.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-004#12:1>
The ministry said it would set aside
&dollar;2 million for schools to hire more support staff.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-004#13:1>
In addition, each school may spend up to 20 per cent of the
&dollar;l00,000 annual Edusave grant it receives on support services.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-004#14:1>
Some measures had been announced earlier.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-004#15:1>
The ministry was elaborating in response to questions from The
Straits Times.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-004#16:1>
It said the release of the report, completed last April, had been
planned since then.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-004#17:1>
The release, it said, was not in response to grouses raised at a
dialogue between the ministry and the Singapore Teachers' Union ( STU) which
was publicised recently in the union's newsletter and in the press.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-004#18:1>
The main grouse raised there was that the teachers' workload had
become very heavy because principals were anxious about the annual school
ranking exercise which was begun last year.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-004#19:1>
These are the survey's findings: <h> * TEACHER ACTIVlTIES </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2C-004#20:1>
On average, teachers spend between six and eight hours a day on
professional duties in school.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-004#21:1>
About an hour is spent on other duties.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-004#22:1>
Mr Ying Cheok Ping, STU's general secretary, commented that teachers
also spent time at home, sometimes until midnight, marking students' work and
preparing lessons.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-004#23:1>
In the survey, many highlighted the need for more support staff to
perform tasks such as collecting school fees, typing, photocopying and
stapling examination papers and tests.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-004#24:1>
<h> * WORKLOAD </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2C-004#25:1>
Teachers were unanimous in saying that examination time was when they
felt the greatest demands of them.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-004#26:1>
They also felt pressed by heightened public interest in education
matters.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-004#27:1>
They wanted clearer definitions of what was expected of them since
they assume the roles of educator, mentor, role-model and counsellor.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-004#28:1>
<h> * TRAINING </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2C-004#29:1>
Teachers are satisfied with in-service courses and workshops, which
they described as useful.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-004#30:1>
Some indicated that a basic course in counselling would benefit all
teachers.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-004#31:1>
Chinese language teachers suggested they be sent to Beijing and
Taiwan for visits and lecture programmes.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-004#32:1>
* WORK ENVIRONMENT: Teachers complained about noise, lack of privacy,
physical discomfort because of the weather, and inadequate storage for books.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-004#33:1>
The ministry will draw up guidelines on teacher responsibilities,
including items such as extra-curricular activities in timetables to reflect
teachers' workloads more accurately.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-004#34:1>
It will also review the focus of in-service training periodically to
ensure that it meets teachers' needs.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-004#35:1>
Those who teach mother tongues will continue to be sent for overseas
training.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-004#36:1>
Twenty-two will go this year and overseas trainers may be brought so
more can benefit.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-004#37:1>
STU's Mr Ying said: " It has become apparent for some time that the
demands on teachers has increased." Referring to their non-professional
duties, he said: " Many find these tasks have interfered with their
teaching." He added: " We welcome the ministry's follow-up actions.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-004#38:1>
STU is pleased to note that the ministry has shown that it is serious
about working in that direction." </I>

<ICE-SIN:W2C-004#40:2>
<h> S'pore children meet friends from many nations - - in Japan </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2C-004#41:2>
By Leon Chan Teik

<ICE-SIN:W2C-004#42:2>
FEW Singaporeans have any inkling where or what Latvia is, but
11-year-old Raihainah Ramlee has met several children from this Baltic
republic.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-004#43:2>
Thanks to the sponsorship of various organisations and regional
governments in Japan, a number of Singapore's 11- and 12-year-olds have been
able to visit Japan on cultural and friendship programmes involving children
from all over the world.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-004#44:2>
On one such trip in April Raihainah of Min Xin Primary in Bedok and
five pupils from Nanyang and Rosyth primary schools stayed in Kobe for 10
days at the invitation of the city's mayor.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-004#45:2>
The organisers paid for their expenses and that of Min Xin's
principal Mrs Helen Tan, who chaperoned the children.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-004#46:2>
The occasion was the World Children's Forum, held in conjunction with
Unicef Week Last week, 20 pupils from Northland Primary in Yishun, their
principal, Mrs Thio Soei Ho, and some teachers flew off to Japan on another
10 day programme.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-004#47:2>
The organiser of the programmes is a Japanese volunteer group,
Children's Communication on Earth.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-004#48:2>
It has no political or religious connections.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-004#49:2>
Its objective is to promote international ties among children.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-004#50:2>
Going by responses of pupils like Raihainah, the programmes are a
success.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-004#51:2>
" I learnt about friendship and made many new friends in Japan," she
said.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-004#52:2>
Since returning home, she has been keeping in touch with her
new-found friends including those from Latvia.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-004#53:2>
She added that she was fascinated with the richness of the different
cultures as depicted during a performance put up by participants.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-004#54:2>
For Trisha Lee of Nanang Primary, who went on the same trip, being
away from home by herself for the first time made her a more responsible
person, she said.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-004#55:2>
Her mother, Mrs Lianne Lee, a housewife, agreed.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-004#56:2>
" I find she has matured a lot.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-004#57:2>
I used to have to ask her to do her work but now she is more
sensible." She added: " She has become more caring too." Every day Trisha was
in Japan, she called home.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-004#58:2>
The phone bill ran to about S150.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-004#59:2>
Mrs Tan, their chaperone, was not surprised that her charges had "
grown up".

<ICE-SIN:W2C-004#60:2>
They really had to look out for themselves.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-004#61:2>
Most of them have maids at home.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-004#62:2>
They had never made their own beds.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-004#63:2>
But some days in Japan, they had to wash their own clothes." While
sharing her daughter's happiness over the trip, Raihainah's mother, Madam
Rohaiyah Mohd Noor, worried a lot, too.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-004#64:2>
" My daughter and I have never been apart like this.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-004#65:2>
I felt very down.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-004#66:2>
She is my only child and I'm a single parent," said the clerical
officer.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-004#67:2>
Another Singaporean group was invited to Japan early this year.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-004#68:2>
It was made up of 12 football players in Primary 5 or 6, selected
from eight schools.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-004#69:2>
They played two friendly matches with their hosts, who paid for most
of the expenses But soccer was not the most important item on the agenda,
said Mr Mat Ariff, 47, the soccer adviser to Singapore schools who
accompanied them.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-004#70:2>
Above all else, the Japanese viewed the occasion as a cultural
exchange programme, he said.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-004#71:2>
They got the Singaporeans to stay with the families of the Japanese
footballers for two nights to experience Japanese hospitality.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-004#72:2>
Next month, eight 11-year-olds will be taking yet another
all-expenses paid trip to Japan.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-004#73:2>
This time, the pupils from Anglo-Chinese, Raffles Girls, Mayflower,
Chongzheng, Jin Tai and St Andrew's primary schools will be there for the 5th
Asian Pacific Children convention.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-004#74:2>
Money back promise with this card By Leong Chan Teik THE first stored
value cards here which no one but the owner can use will be available soon.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-004#75:2>
A local electronics company, Signetics Systems, has been appointed by
a subsidiary of Japanese telecommunications giant Nippon Telegraph and
Telephone Corporation ( NTT) to market cards which can be blacklisted once
they are reported lost.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-004#76:2>
A spokesman for Goldtron, the parent company of Signetics, said its
cards are the first here with that feature.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-004#77:2>
In contrast, other prepaid cards, such as phone cards, can be used by
any bearer.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-004#78:2>
An owner who has lost his card can be compensated for the remaining
value after a computer has tracked its earlier purchases.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-004#79:2>
But for that - - and to prevent fraudulent claims - - organisations
using the card system will need to keep particulars of the card buyers, as
organisations in Japan do.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-004#80:2>
Goldtron is targeting its cards at " closed systems" - department
stores, fast food chains, supermarkets, petrol stations and restaurants.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-004#81:2>
The card is good for different types of transactions.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-004#82:2>
For instance, at a participating shopping centre, it can be used to
pay for goods and car park charges.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-004#83:2>
Signetics is signing an agreement on Monday with U-Card Incorporated,
an NTT subsidiary, to market the cards here and in the region, and manage the
card systems.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-004#84:2>
U-Card Inc will design and manufacture the cards.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-004#85:2>
Signetics's first client is NTUC's Pasir Ris Resort.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-004#86:2>
This came after a seven-month trial ending in May, said Mr Charlie
Goh, the resort's personnel and marketing manager.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-004#87:2>
Under the system, the resort's 320 staff slot their cards into a "
reader" for meals in the resort's cafeteria.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-004#88:2>
A &dollar;3 value is deducted each time from the card which has a stored value of
&dollar;75 and is valid for a month.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-004#89:2>
Previously, they had to search for their name against a staff list
and sign against it.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-004#90:2>
The resort has ordered a year's supply of 40,000 cards at a cost of
&dollar;1.50 each.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-004#91:2>
It is looking into the possibility of extending the use of the card
to regular visitors.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-004#92:2>
NTT's cards, known as U-cards in Japan, are used in more than 10,000
shops there, said NTT's chief representative here, Mr Hitoshi Kato.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-004#93:2>
One benefit of prepaid cards, he said, is that they will facilitate
transactions when the 3 per cent Goods and Services Tax is introduced here
next year.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-004#94:2>
Payments are likely to involve loose change and one cent
denominations.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-004#95:2>
Customers using prepaid cards need not prepare the exact change or
accept many coins.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-004#96:2>
The cards can also be used as gifts in place of vouchers, he said.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-004#97:2>
Prepaid cards can also incorporate a bonus system, as found in cards
for Yishun's 10-cinema multiplex.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-004#98:2>
For a year now, it has been offering

&dollar;45 transferable cards which allow patrons to buy 10 tickets costing
&dollar;5 each - - which means that one is a bonus free ticket.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-004#99:2>
Since January, the price of a ticket has gone up to
&dollar;6, but patrons who use the prepaid cards can still buy 10 tickets.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-004#100:2>
Mrs Sally Crawford, a spokesman for the complex, said 15,000 cards
have been sold so far, and their popularity is increasing.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-004#101:2>
A bonus system and the flexibility of being offered as gifts are
among the features that will allow prepaid cards to hold their own when Nets'
Cashcards are implemented nationwide in 1995, said industry sources.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-004#102:2>
The Cashcards can be used for a range of purposes.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-004#103:2>
Asked about the blacklisting feature, Nets said this week that it is
not necessary for the Cashcard, when used as a substitute for cash, to have
that capability, " just as you would not generally blacklist currency notes
you lost." Cashcards which are combined with ATM card functions, however,
will be personalised, and it can be verified easily if the user is the owner,
it added. </I>

Pastor comforts dying motorcyclist

<ICE-SIN:W2C-004#106:3>
A SINGAPORE pastor was on hand to comfort and pray for the dying Mr
Tan Kheng Sun.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-004#107:3>
Reverend Leslie Quahe, 35, himself a biker, helped Mr Tan " make
peace with God", said tour organiser Rodney Yeo.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-004#108:3>
A motorcycling enthusiast who rides a Honda NV 400, Rev Quahe of the
Christ Methodist Church in East Coast Road switched to the motorcycle three
years ago when car and petrol prices started going up.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-004#109:3>
He was travelling on his first rally.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-004#110:3>
His wife, Lin Yun, 26, their nine-month-old daughter Ariel, and
family members of other bikers went along in an accompanying 44-seater coach.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-004#111:3>
Some bikers said that Mr Tan could have survived the accident if his
helmet had not fallen off.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-004#112:3>
They said he hit his head hard when he crashed onto the road.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-004#113:3>
He is survived by his wife, Madam Wong Souk Yee, 34, who was not on
the trip. <X>

<ICE-SIN:W2C-004#X114:3>
The couple have no children.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-004#X115:3>
She was one of 22 people detained in 1987 for being involved in a
Marxist plot to overthrow the Government.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-004#X116:3>
She was released in 1989 after the Government decided that she was
unlikely to resume subversive activities and pose a security threat.

<ICE-SIN:W2C-004#X117:3>
She is a playwright and one of the founder members of the drama
troupe Third Stage. </X> </I>
