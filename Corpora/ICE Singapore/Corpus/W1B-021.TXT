Dear Sir/Madam

<ICE-SIN:W1B-021#11:1>
Survey of Individual Shareownership, 1991

<ICE-SIN:W1B-021#12:1>
The Stock Exchange of Singapore is conducting a shareownership survey
of Singapore-incorporated companies in two stages.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-021#13:1>
In the first stage, we have compiled some shareownership statistics
from records maintained by the registrars of Singapore-incorporated companies
listed on the Exchange.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-021#14:1>
In the second stage, we will be collecting very detailed statistics
directly from individual shareowners of these Singapore-incorporated
companies.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-021#15:1>
This individual shareownership survey is being conducted on a sample
basis by means of the mail questionnaire method.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-021#16:1>
As you have been selected for this survey, we shall be very grateful
if you would kindly complete the enclosed questionnaire and return it in the
self-addressed stamped envelope by 15th June 1991.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-021#17:1>
We are pleased to inform you that in connection with this individual
shareownership survey, we will be conducting a lucky draw for our
respondents.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-021#18:1>
The prizes and rules governing this lucky draw are given at the back
of this letter.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-021#19:1>
Your participation and cooperation in this survey will be much
appreciated.

<ICE-SIN:W1B-021#20:1>
