<h> Video-on-demand: still more to be done </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-037#2:1>
About 500 households from different parts of Singapore will be
involved in the video-on-demand trial conducted by Singapore Telecom

Comfortably lounging on a sofa in his three-room HDB apartment, Mr Tan
reaches for his TV remote control to check which Sharon Stone movies are
available on TV.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-037#5:1>
He considers Basic Instinct but finally chooses Crocodile Dundee.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-037#6:1>
Halfway through, he presses " Pause" on the remote to stop the movie.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-037#7:1>
He calls up another function, and orders a pizza from a menu which
appears on the TV screen.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-037#8:1>
He presses " Start" to continue watching the movie until the delivery
boy shows up with his pizza a while later.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-037#9:1>
This is the world of video-on-demand ( VOD).

<ICE-SIN:W2B-037#10:1>
A couch potato's dream and a video rental shop operator's nightmare,
VOD is seen as the killer application that will provide the initial impetus
for the interactive TV industry.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-037#11:1>
With the complete digitalisation of Singapore's telephone network,
VOD and other interactive services will soon become a reality.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-037#12:1>
The same VOD network can also be used for two-way services such as
tele-shopping ( like in the case of ordering the pizza), long distance
learning, and playing computer games with friends several thousand kilometres
away.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-037#13:1>
In Singapore, VOD trials will start in June next year with 150
households which will be increased to 500 within 18 months.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-037#14:1>
Singapore Telecom, which is conducting the trial, will initially
offer services like movies-on-demand, customised news, home shopping and
interactive education.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-037#15:1>
Beginning March 1996, it will introduce additional services like
games and karaoke-on-demand, Telecom spokesman Mr Ivan Tan said.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-037#16:1>
The trials will cover a broad cross-section of Singapore households
and will not be restricted to just a few areas.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-037#17:1>
Telecom expects to award the tender for trial VOD equipment within
the next two months, he added.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-037#18:1>
VOD involves the conversion of movies and television shows into
digital form so that they can be piped into homes via telephone lines.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-037#19:1>
At the household, a little " black box" converts these signals into
pictures which are then played over the TV screen.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-037#20:1>
VOD's advantage over TV or the cinema is obvious - - subscribers can
choose which programmes they would like to watch, when they want to watch it,
and all from the comforts of home.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-037#21:1>
All they have to do is use a small remote control to make their
selections which will be sent via telephone line to a computerised switch.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-037#22:1>
The switch will in turn direct the information to a computer called a
video server which stores all the programmes.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-037#23:1>
This server will then deliver the requested programme via telephone
line to viewers.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-037#24:1>
For VOD service to take off, the price of a movie must be no more
than what it takes to rent a video or see a movie.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-037#25:1>
In Singapore, that price would be around
&dollar;5 to
&dollar;10, said Mr Anil Uberoi, Sun Microsystems Group Marketing Manager for
Networking Products.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-037#26:1>
" More than
&dollar;5 and consumers would think twice before signing up for VOD".

<ICE-SIN:W2B-037#27:1>
Apart from price, there are several challenges that VOD operators
must overcome before they can implement a system.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-037#28:1>
VOD is a capital intensive project.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-037#29:1>
Apart from the " pipes" that carry the movies, games and other stuff,
the VOD operator must have the equipment and the software to bill customers.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-037#30:1>
What about the " black boxes" - - do customers pay for them?

<ICE-SIN:W2B-037#31:1>
Then there are also technical difficulties such as standards and
electronic storage of contents like movies.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-037#32:1>
These issues are examined in the next pages. </I>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-037#34:2>
Depite the many problems that persist, there is no doubt that the
information superhighway will eventually have a tremendous impact on the way
we live

<ICE-SIN:W2B-037#35:2>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-037#36:2>
By this time next year, Singapore will have jumped onto the
video-on-demand ( VOD) bandwagon with the start of the nationwide trial by
Singapore Telecom.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-037#37:2>
Singaporeans from an initial 150 households will be able to call up
movies at the touch of a button and watch the movie on their television set.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-037#38:2>
They will also be able to receive customised news, and have access to
home shopping and interactive educational services.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-037#39:2>
Operating on a smaller scale, the Marina Mandarin installed recently
a VOD service offering guests up to 60 video titles a day.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-037#40:2>
The system will be up and running by the end of the month, the
hotel's spokesman said.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-037#41:2>
In fact, it seems just a matter of time before cinemas and video
rental shops go the way of the dinosaur.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-037#42:2>
However, behind this seemingly unstoppable march into the 21st
century lurks several customer, technical and business issues that need to be
resolved.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-037#43:2>
They include the choice of the TV set as the receiving vehicle for
VOD, which is being questioned by those who say the PC is preferable, not
only for movies but also for all sorts of information delivered over the
information highways.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-037#44:2>
Currently, the most pressing issues facing VOD operators seem to
relate to technology, especially compression and storage.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-037#45:2>
Storing digitised video continues to be a struggle.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-037#46:2>
For example, a 120-minute movie eats up at least 2 GB of memory.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-037#47:2>
As such, a modest video server containing only 50 titles requires
over 100GB of computer storage.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-037#48:2>
Piping this information through the telephone lines to homes and
offices is another technical challenge.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-037#49:2>
Current compression technology can only send 20 frames of a movie per
second on copper.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-037#50:2>
This gives a picture quality that is similar to what video tapes
offer.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-037#51:2>
To achieve TV-type quality requires 30 frames per second.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-037#52:2>
As such, it does not matter how short the distance between the fibre
optic trunk and the television set is.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-037#53:2>
Although fibre optics are used throughout Singapore, the stretch
between the kerb and the flat or house requires another several hundred
metres of copper wire.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-037#54:2>
Installing fibre optics would be expensive but maybe unnecessary
because of potential future developments in compression technology.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-037#55:2>
Scientists are currently trying to reduce the strain of transmitting
video over telephone lines by filtering out redundant information - - for
example the mountain in the background - - between one frame and the next, so
that the network need only carry the parts of the video that has changed.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-037#56:2>
Other issues which VOD providers and equipment vendors must look into
include compatibility between the different equipment on the market, and
developing systems that allow signals to be sent over a hotchpotch of
telephone lines.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-037#57:2>
This is because even in the most advance cities like Singapore,
telephone lines comprise copper, coaxial and optic fibre cables.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-037#58:2>
Another issue for VOD operators to ponder is ease of use.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-037#59:2>
Mr Charles Christ, the vice-president in charge of Digital Equipment
Corporation's thrust into the interactive TV market, said: " VOD must be
painless to use, and the response time must be instantaneous".

<ICE-SIN:W2B-037#60:2>
The same TV viewers today who still do not know how to program a
video cassette recorder are the potential VOD customers.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-037#61:2>
No VOD system is going to have any headway if it is difficult to
access.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-037#62:2>
The system's response time must be like that of a remote control-TV
connection.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-037#63:2>
If VOD does not respond immediately, users will be put off, he said.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-037#64:2>
In addition, there is the billing system to consider.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-037#65:2>
It must be automatic, like using the telephone.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-037#66:2>
Currently, most cable operators charge viewers a fixed monthly
subscription rate.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-037#67:2>
But once viewers only pay what they choose to view, VOD operators
must be able to track usage.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-037#68:2>
Cable operators who want to provide VOD must learn quickly how to put
in place such a system.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-037#69:2>
Other issues need to be faced by VOD operators like cost, government
regulations and the type of movies and other services to deliver using the
information highway.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-037#70:2>
Said Oracle Systems Singapore's marketing manager Mr Gary Winder: " A
city-wide VOD service will take some time to take off.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-037#71:2>
There are huge investments and test-marketing to consider".

<ICE-SIN:W2B-037#72:2>
Hongkong Telecom, for example, said it probably needs a critical mass
of 200,000 subscribers, each spending an average of around HK&dollar;350 ( S&dollar;70), if
its project is to be successful.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-037#73:2>
Highlighting the problem of getting accurate feedback, Dr William Lo,
Hongkong Telecom's director for strategic planning and project director for
VOD, said: " If you stop a person on the street and ask him what he wants, he
will say educational programmes.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-037#74:2>
Very few people will tell you what they actually want to see".

<ICE-SIN:W2B-037#75:2>
Finally, there are deeply ingrained habits that are hard to break.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-037#76:2>
For example, it is possible that many Singaporeans go out to the
cinema not just because they want to catch that particular movie.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-037#77:2>
To them it could just be an excuse to get out of the house to do
something and to mingle with the crowds.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-037#78:2>
As such, it seems that the light at the end of the tunnel for VOD is
not as bright as it might first appear.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-037#79:2>
Many problems persist, but there is no doubt that the information
superhighway will become a reality.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-037#80:2>
And it will have a tremendous impact on the way we live.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-037#81:2>
VOD equipment will become as commonplace as TV sets and radio, and
interactive TV services will grow into a multi-billion dollar business.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-037#82:2>
The only question is how soon. </I>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-037#84:3>
The information boom will drive growth in the 90s.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-037#85:3>
There will be new jobs and services and the way we live, work and
play will change

<ICE-SIN:W2B-037#87:3>
The information superhighway can be used for the following uses: "
Talking" to people from all over the world via modems and PCs; more than just
social chat, it widens one's shouting distance where others respond to
appeals for assistance.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-037#88:3>
For work where office workers reach across the other side of the
world electronically to look for information on on-line databases.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-037#89:3>
Discuss projects with customers through video conferencing and stay
in touch with office through telecomputing; and Shopping where people can buy
many things such as clothes, toys, theatre tickets and books in an electronic
supermarket.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-037#90:3>
Investing in stocks and shares as well as personal finance
management; the computer's ability to manipulate complex databases located in
different parts of the world allows users to track both personal and
corporate investments.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-037#91:3>
One example is Internet, a giant global electronic community of 20
million users linked together by 25,000 interconnecting networks.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-037#92:3>
Internet has already transformed the way people view the world from
their living rooms, laboratories, factories and offices.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-037#93:3>
Singapore hopes the same transformation will take place with its own
effort, the national information infrastructure, which will see the island
criss-crossed by several networks delivering a variety of features and
functions.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-037#94:3>
The spectrum of applications stretches from video-on-demand to other
more significant efforts such as emergency medical services. </I>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-037#96:4>
You've just got back from a bad day at work.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-037#97:4>
You need a cold beer, fast.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-037#98:4>
But just to complete that confounded day, the missus ( or your
foolish self) had to forget to put new beer in the fridge and heaven knows
you hate to mix ice in your beer.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-037#99:4>
Diluted beer is for old men who hang out at coffee-shops!

<ICE-SIN:W2B-037#100:4>
Answer?

<ICE-SIN:W2B-037#101:4>
Just Cool!

<ICE-SIN:W2B-037#102:4>
Put some ice in it, pop in your unopened can of beer ( up till
500ml) press a button and presto!

<ICE-SIN:W2B-037#103:4>
In 90 seconds, your beer is ice-cold!

<ICE-SIN:W2B-037#104:4>
Do it for beer, do it for Coke, Pocari, anything in a can.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-037#105:4>
Great for parties, picnics or anytime you need a cold but undiluted
drink!

<ICE-SIN:W2B-037#106:4>
