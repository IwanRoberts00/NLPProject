<I>

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-032#1:1:A>
I think it's true that uh in the market there is general
perception that the prices may begin to to move down and the I think this
perception is uh due to too many expectations

<ICE-SIN:S1B-032#2:1:A>
One is that there seems to be coming on-stream over supply of uh
residential property and secondly there seems to be a consensus that the
economy may be weakening

<ICE-SIN:S1B-032#3:1:A>
My own opinion is that uh the market will probably be stable for at
least a few more months after which uh it may begin to ease but not very much
<X>

<ICE-SIN:S1B-032#X4:1:A>
Martin </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-032#5:1:A>
Perhaps uh five per cent which is what I said before uh

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-032#6:1:B>
Well I think uhm basically uhm everybody is now on the side
lines waiting and personally I think the property market is really toppish
because I think uh if you look between 1985 and now the prices have gone up
probably close to three times so the I I believe the upside potential is
limited and I think the prices should come down as uh Dr Amos said five to
ten per cent

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-032#7:1:C>
Well uhm from historical record in fact we have seen that the
rate of increase in prices have started to drop since about end of 89 so even
though there is an increase over all these months the rate of increase has
been dropping so that seem to suggest that we are also heading also for
downward uh uh movement of the price <X>

<ICE-SIN:S1B-032#X8:1:C>
Martin </X>

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-032#9:1:C>
I think well it's anybody's guess

<ICE-SIN:S1B-032#10:1:C>
It could be five

<ICE-SIN:S1B-032#11:1:C>
It could be ten

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-032#12:1:B>
Well I have a different opinion from all the other three

<ICE-SIN:S1B-032#13:1:B>
Uh we are more bullish uhm having crunched our numbers we realise
that yes prices have gone up considerably since 1985 or 86 but then at the
same time so has uhm income of Singaporeans uhm so the actual affordability
has actually improved

<ICE-SIN:S1B-032#14:1:B>
Uhm the other factors to consider would be the fall in interest
rates here

<ICE-SIN:S1B-032#15:1:B>
Against that you've got relatively higher yield on rental of say
condominium apartments and there's also foreign factor

<ICE-SIN:S1B-032#16:1:B>
You've mentioned Hong Kongers but uh I think there's another factor
to consider which is the shortage of local professionals in the work force
here which means that there'll be a continued strong influx of expatriates to
meet that short fall <X>

<ICE-SIN:S1B-032#X17:1:B>
Martin </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-032#18:1:B>
Yes I'm bullish <X>

<ICE-SIN:S1B-032#X19:1:B>
Martin </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-032#20:1:B>
I think prices will remain at current levels for say another
four to six months and there after people will start to come back again
because the longer prospective buyers prospective cash-up buyers wait the
more anxious they are about possibly missing the bottom of the market <X>

<ICE-SIN:S1B-032#X21:1:B>
Martin </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-032#22:1:B>
Yes I think he is very optimistic

<ICE-SIN:S1B-032#23:1:B>
Uhm basically he mentioned about the increase in income

<ICE-SIN:S1B-032#24:1:B>
Well uh I think if you look at the increase in income versus the
increase in property prices over the last five years uhm you know as I
mentioned property prices have gone up by more than three times but certainty
income didn't go up in terms of in that proportion so uhm uhm I think he is
pretty optimistic

<ICE-SIN:S1B-032#25:1:B>


<ICE-SIN:S1B-032#26:1:B>
Well but the other factor to consider is capital gains from those
who are now in public housing

<ICE-SIN:S1B-032#27:1:B>
If you have bought a say five-room HDB flat five years ago at
around five years ago at around hundred thousand dollars today you could sell
it for easily two hundred thousand dollars

<ICE-SIN:S1B-032#28:1:B>
So with that and the uh increase in income in salaries since then
most couples should be able let's say a significant number of uh household in
public housing would be able to upgrade to private <X>

<ICE-SIN:S1B-032#X29:1:B>
Martin </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-032#30:1:A>
Uh I think I have to to step back a bit
ICE-SIN:S1B-032#> Uh assuming that we are at the peak it doesn't mean that the this is not
the a good time to buy

<ICE-SIN:S1B-032#31:1:A>
Uh generally speaking prices are expected to move down uh later
part of the year

<ICE-SIN:S1B-032#32:1:A>
But uh assuming that you are careful in your choice of property uh
if you buy at the peak a very good quality property in a good location uhm
from historical trends we have seen that actually although the property
market moves in cycles uh every cycle is higher than the than the previous

<ICE-SIN:S1B-032#33:1:A>
And if you buy at the peak and you are willing to have a longer
term investment horizon to hold on uh to say around the next peak

<ICE-SIN:S1B-032#34:1:A>
Uh in fact historically we have found that the rate of growth for
capital appreciation has been quite good you have six seven per cent <X>

<ICE-SIN:S1B-032#X35:1:A>
Martin </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-032#36:1:A>
We are basing uh our projections mainly on the possible supply
situation

<ICE-SIN:S1B-032#37:1:A>
In fact we agree with Yew Boon that the demand is strong but the
price being quite high tends to dampen demand because uh it acts as a ceiling
from people's perception

<ICE-SIN:S1B-032#38:1:A>
But uh supply is still a very fundamental uh component uh of of of
factor of price and looking at uhm landed property as compared with
condominiums the supply for condominium would be we estimate for the next two
or three years about thirty per cent or above say thirty to forty per cent
over supply compared to landed property of about fifteen to thirty per cent

<ICE-SIN:S1B-032#39:1:A>
So looking at this just from the supply point of view there seems
to be uh perhaps a greater amount of oversupply for apartments and therefore
there maybe a greater down side for apartments compared to landed property
<X>

<ICE-SIN:S1B-032#X40:1:A>
Martin </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-032#41:1:A>
Uhm well now it's it's uh let's let's look at the question
from the point of view of uh uh growth right

<ICE-SIN:S1B-032#42:1:A>
Uh I was saying that the the the long-term trend is one of a growth
in the property prices so if you if you are willing to hold long-term then
you could say that even at the the peak it is not the wrong time to buy
provided you are very careful in choosing good quality property alright

<ICE-SIN:S1B-032#43:1:A>
On the other hand you say let's let's wait until it slides ten
fifteen or even twenty per cent or let me wait wait until the market is down
but we know generally that it is when the market is high that you do get
people selling good property in good locality this which are perhaps with uh
well secured tenants and if you wait for say the bottom of the market now you
may be scrapping the bottom barrel <X>

<ICE-SIN:S1B-032#X44:1:A>
Martin </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-032#45:1:B>
Well uhm I would say it depends on the type of properties that
you are looking at

<ICE-SIN:S1B-032#46:1:B>
Certainly I think apartments you know I feel that uhm there is a
potential that it may come down so uhm if you have a pro just now you were
mentioning about the the guy wanting to buy the property when to buy and when
not to buy it really depends on your time horizon as as uh Dr Amos said you
know

<ICE-SIN:S1B-032#47:1:B>
The other thing is uhm in terms of upgrading if you're buying it
for your own owner occupation then you know the timing is less important

<ICE-SIN:S1B-032#48:1:B>
Because if you were to wait for the down turn you know you maybe
never be able to get the property that you like

<ICE-SIN:S1B-032#49:1:B>
So it really depends on your own personal what you think and the
other thing that is very important is your cash flow you know whether your
monthly income is able to service the kind of properties that you are buying
at <X>

<ICE-SIN:S1B-032#X50:1:B>
Martin </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-032#51:1:B>
Yah I think so <X>

<ICE-SIN:S1B-032#X52:1:B>
Martin </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-032#53:1:A>
For investment meaning that you want to buy to let out

<ICE-SIN:S1B-032#54:1:A>
At the same time perhaps in a few year's time to sell for capital
gain

<ICE-SIN:S1B-032#55:1:A>
Uh for budget say uhm HDB homeowner possibly if you have budget of
say four hundred to five hundred thousand you'll be good to look at uh
preferably uh prime districts which we we know nine ten eleven and in fact
perhaps fifteen too because these are the areas which are preferred by
expatriate management uh staff who require housing and they uh go for these
areas and the rentals that you can get probably would would be quite like
seven per cent yield

<ICE-SIN:S1B-032#56:1:A>
Uh advertisement at ten per cent yield seems to be really too
perhaps exaggerated <X>

<ICE-SIN:S1B-032#X57:1:A>
Martin </X>

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-032#58:1:A>
Outside prime if you think for investment uh well uhm you may
get a yield of six per cent which is not bad uhm but the there is perhaps a a
little more difficulty in letting out

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-032#59:1:C>
I think if we look at the uh figures you would see that prices
are actually becoming quite uh similar in various district outside the prime
area and this trend will go on as the uh island decentralised in its
development pattern So in a sense there's really a wide range of districts
and areas to buy into

<ICE-SIN:S1B-032#60:1:C>
What is probably more important for Mr Lim would be to uh make a
very careful assessment of his personal needs the needs of the households
perhaps accessibility to uh places or place of work uh the schools uh schools
for the children and so on

<ICE-SIN:S1B-032#61:1:C>
So that would be more important <X>

<ICE-SIN:S1B-032#X62:1:C>
Martin </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-032#63:1:B>
Well certainly for investments we look at two things

<ICE-SIN:S1B-032#64:1:B>
One is the rental and one you know is the capital appreciation

<ICE-SIN:S1B-032#65:1:B>
Well uhm I think in terms of investments if you are buying a
property for investments location is very important uhm location is the
important thing that you should be looking at because in terms of
appreciation when the market goes up they are the ones to go up fastest and
when the when the market they are the the ones to come down fastest

<ICE-SIN:S1B-032#66:1:B>
And in terms of rentals I think you can get much better rentals and
much better sup uh demand by the expatriates

<ICE-SIN:S1B-032#67:1:B>
So I would say that if you are buying a property for investments
you should look for prime location uh res uhm apartments <X>

<ICE-SIN:S1B-032#X68:1:B>
Martin </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-032#69:1:B>
Yes I think so because if you are buying houses let's say for
example in this particular person he's he's living in HDB he could opt for a
terrace for example because I think like a terrace or semi-detached the
prices have gone up much less than would the uh the condos

<ICE-SIN:S1B-032#70:1:B>
Uh in terms of the price increase I think the the uhm the landed
properties have gone up probably about thirty to fifty per cent compared to
condos which have gone up about three times so I think in terms of the
potential for capital appreciation

<ICE-SIN:S1B-032#71:1:B>
Certainly I think landed property is a better bet but again you
know it depends on your own personal preference <X>

<ICE-SIN:S1B-032#X72:1:B>
Martin </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-032#73:1:B>
I think until the uhm government particular the CPF changes
its uh regulations uh the leasehold property would be a safer bet because uhm
sorry freehold property I guess uh you know leasehold property uh I think
after ten or or twenty years up to close to twenty years the property uh the
capital appreciation potential isn't quite there

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-032#74:1:C>
But I think there is a psychological factor at at work because
I think we still very much like to own a piece of the turf in Singapore and
if you look at the new uh supply coming onto the market that is in private
housing than we have almost two-third of it in the form of uh medium price
terrace houses

<ICE-SIN:S1B-032#75:1:C>
But that obviously uh tells you that both the public sector as well
as the pri pri private sector is targeting that particular segment of the
market

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-032#76:1:B>
Well I think if you have half a million you can easily buy in
a terrace in a uhm not so prime location uhm and uh I think you can also you
can also buy a small apartment if you want to so uhm there is still market if
you have a half million there is still a supply of such properties in the
market <X>

<ICE-SIN:S1B-032#X77:1:B>
Martin </X>

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-032#78:1:B>
The only the the the only I think uhm semi-detached have gone
beyond half a million except for really off-side locations or very old
properties so I think it is really beyond the reach if you have half a
million for semi-detached <X>

<ICE-SIN:S1B-032#X79:1:B>
Martin

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1B-032#X80:1:B>
Well uhm we look at properties quite differently from the
real-estate valuers because uhm we look we we deal a lot with customers so we
know roughly the transactions that are going around We also look at what we
think the uh longer term uh market is so taking things into considerations
most of the time we would have taken the purchase and said that uh compared
to say you know transactions that were going around in the last uh two three
days or two three months and we would feel we would know that whether that is
a good price or not <X> </I>
