<ICE-SIN:W2B-024#3:1>
The Common Myna, Acridotheres tristis, and the White-vented Myna, A
javanicus, are two of the most common species of birds in Singapore.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-024#4:1>
The Common Myna ranges from Afghanistan to Southwest China.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-024#5:1>
It is resident in most of Southeast Asia and has been introduced in
many countries, eg Australia, New Zealand and Hawaii.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-024#6:1>
The Common Myna was first recorded in Singapore in 1936 as it expanded
its range southwards from Peninsular Malaysia.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-024#7:1>
The White-vented Myna ranges from East Pakistan to South China and is
resident in Myanmar, Thailand, Indochina, Java and Sulawesi.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-024#8:1>
It was introduced locally around 1924 either deliberately or as
escaped cage birds.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-024#9:1>
Common and White-vented Mynas are medium-sized birds ( total length ca
250 mm) with overlapping distributions in Singapore.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-024#10:1>
Both species are abundant because urbanisation and deforestation have
created suitable habitats for them, whether in the heart of the city,
industrial estates, or suburban housing, park or beach areas.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-024#11:1>
They are also numerous in the few remaining patches of rural habitat.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-024#12:1>
However the two species do not occur in equal abundance: there are
presently about three times as many White-vented Mynas as Common Mynas.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-024#13:1>
Feeding is an important activity and occupies about 25% of a myna's
time budget.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-024#14:1>
Both species of myna are omnivorous and eat a variety of food ranging
from insects and earthworms found in grass-field to food scraps.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-024#15:1>
Some types of food may be termed ephemeral: these are temporary
sources of food which occur in superabundance, and are usually clumped in
distribution.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-024#16:1>
For instance, a common sight is that of aggregations of mynas on a
newly mown field, feeding on earthworms and insects disturbed by the activity
of the grass mowing machine and often following it.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-024#17:1>
Heavy rain often causes waterlogging of fields, and earthworms and
other soil fauna evacuating their flooded burrows provide another ephemeral
source of food.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-024#18:1>
Insects swarm under certain environmental conditions and these swarms
serve as transient but protein-rich source of food for mynas and other
insectivores.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-024#19:1>
Plants also provide different types of ephemeral food in the form of
nectar from flowers and fruit, whether wild ( eg figs tembusu berries) or
cultivated ( eg papaya, banana, jambu).

<ICE-SIN:W2B-024#20:1>
Casuarina, usually planted along the coast and beach areas, fruits
periodically and the exposed ovules in the ripened cones form yet another
temporary supply of nourishment for mynas.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-024#21:1>
Another example of ephemeral foods includes carrion in the form of
the occasional dog, cat or bird killed by motor vehicles.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-024#22:1>
Common and White-vented Mynas appear to have adopted different
feeding strategies.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-024#23:1>
The White-vented Myna behaves opportunistically and supplements its
regular food sources by exploiting ephemeral foods when they are available.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-024#24:1>
In contrast, the Common Myna appears to be more of a specialist, and
relies predominantly on regular food supplies found on its home range.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-024#25:1>
By adopting different feeding strategies, the two species are able to
co-exist in the same habitats in Singapore.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-024#26:1>
It has been suggested that the 'aggressive' mynas may have been
responsible for the decline of some species of birds in Singapore.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-024#27:1>
Some studies in New Zealand and Hawaii have implicated the Common
Myna as a predator of eggs and nestlings of some seabirds such as
shearwaters, noddies and terns.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-024#28:1>
Common Mynas have also been reported to destroy the nests of some
land birds such as warblers in New Zealand.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-024#29:1>
However in Singapore, it was observed that both species of myna
usually direct their aggression towards members of their own species.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-024#30:1>
Fights over food or nest sites involve grappling and tearing at the
opponent with the legs and pecking.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-024#31:1>
Sometimes such fights can be fatal.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-024#32:1>
But both species are generally submissive when they encounter other
species of birds, eg Black-naped Oriole Oriolus chinensis, Collared
Kingfisher Halcyon chloris and House Crow Corvus splendens.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-024#33:1>
One may often see mynas running or flying for cover when chased by
these birds.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-024#34:1>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-024#35:1>
Mynas are reported to be monogamous and breed throughout the year.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-024#36:1>
Courtship and pair-bonding behaviours are observed from August
onwards, followed by nest-building and incubation from January to May.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-024#37:1>
Fledglings are often seen around June or July.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-024#38:1>
Mynas nest in holes and are catholic in their choice of sites, eg on
window ledges, in tree-holes, abandoned vehicles, air vents and man-made
nest-boxes.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-024#39:1>
Both sexes are involved in nest-building.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-024#40:1>
The nest is often an untidy mass made of leaves, paper, pieces of
plastic and a variety of other materials.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-024#41:1>
Two nests built on window ledges that were used by Common Mynas for
several years were as large as half-a-metre in diameter!

<ICE-SIN:W2B-024#42:1>
Nests made in nest-boxes consist of a pile of materials lining three
sides of the box.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-024#43:1>
A shallow depression lined with leaves is formed in one corner and
serves to hold the clutch.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-024#44:1>
Common Mynas lay between 3 to 6 eggs per clutch while White-vented
Mynas have been observed to lay about 2 to 4 eggs per clutch.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-024#45:1>
The eggs of both species are elliptical in shape, pale blue in colour
and are about the same size and weight.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-024#46:1>
Each egg is about 30 mm long and 21 mm wide and weighs about 7 g.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-024#48:1>
The other nestling is two days old.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-024#49:1>
The last egg was eventually removed by the parent birds.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-024#50:1>
A nest built by White-vented Mynas in a nest-box with a clutch of two
eggs.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-024#51:1>
Not all the eggs of a clutch will hatch - - usually two fledglings
are observed for each pair of birds, with broods of 3 or 4 being infrequent.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-024#52:1>
The length of time taken from the laying of the clutch to fledging
has been reported to be around 4 weeks for Common Mynas.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-024#53:1>
More work is currently being carried out to study the breeding
biology of both species in the aviary and in the field.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-024#54:1>
Mynas are considered pests in Singapore because of their habit of
roosting communally in housing estates, where they irritate the residents
with their noise and soil the ground and objects below with their faeces.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-024#55:1>
So far, no effective method has been found to control these birds.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-024#56:1>
Methods that are based on reducing food, nesting and roosting sites,
are unlikely to succeed since both species use a wide range of these
resources.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-024#57:1>
Similarly roost dispersal measures such as the pruning or removal of
roost trees and scaring or killing the birds are only temporarily effective
as birds return when the disturbance is stopped.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-024#58:1>
At present it seems that the public must learn to tolerate mild
inconveniences as it is impossible to solve all roost problems.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-024#59:1>
After all, mynas have always been roosting communally and it is
alteration to the natural habitat which has created sites in our housing
estates that provide suitable alternative roosting sites for the birds.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-024#60:1>
Mynas are not exotic but they are interesting birds to study.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-024#61:1>
There are still many aspects of their behaviour and ecology which
warrant investigation.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-024#62:1>
For instance, White-vented Mynas are expanding fairly rapidly up
Peninsular Malaysia ( D R Wells, pers comm).

<ICE-SIN:W2B-024#63:1>
How would the population dynamics of Common and Buffalo Mynas A
fuscus, which are resident in Peninsular Malaysia, change as White-vented
Mynas spread into their habitats?

<ICE-SIN:W2B-024#64:1>
And in Singapore, the question still remains as to whether
White-vented Mynas would displace Common Mynas as White-vented Mynas are the
more numerous species.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-024#65:1>
Whilst both species have adapted well to the urban environment in
Singapore, White-vented Mynas may be using a feeding strategy which better
exploits the sources of food that are available.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-024#66:1>
For instance, government planning policies which cater for the
planting of fruit and flowering trees may inadvertently enhance the success
of White-vented Mynas.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-024#67:1>
It has been estimated that of a total of about 691,915 trees that are
maintained by the Parks and Recreation Department, Ministry of National
Development, about 17% or 119,035 trees provide or could provide potential
sources of food in the form of nectar or fruit which can be effectively
exploited by White-vented Mynas.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-024#68:1>
And fruit and nectar are not the only ephemeral food patches provided
through the activities of Man.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-024#69:1>
Lawns and fields in parks, schools, gardens or road verges need to be
mown regularly to remain well-kept and it has been seen that this activity
supplies insect prey and earthworms for mynas.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-024#70:1>
A fledgling White vented Myna - - it can be distinguished by the
white colour of its irides.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-024#71:1>
At this stage, it is still partially dependent on its parents for
food.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-024#72:1>
The number of birds in a roost ranges from a few to thousands.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-024#73:1>
Many roosts are mixed, containing Common and White vented Mynas as
well as Philippine Glossy Starlings Aplonis panayensis.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-024#74:1>
A communal roost in a housing estate - - the noise disturbs the
residents and faeces soil the cars parked below.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-024#75:1>
Mynas returning to roost as evening falls.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-024#76:1>
Hence Man's role in changing the habitat has contributed to the
spread and increase in the size of the myna population in Singapore.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-024#77:1>
His activities may also have helped to enhance the success of
White-vented Mynas in particular, by providing supplemental sources of food (
ie ephemeral food sources) which are exploited effectively by this species.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-024#78:1>
Thus two factors, use of a feeding strategy by the White-vented Myna
that may be more successful than the one adopted by the Common Myna, and
Man's role in altering the habitat may have contributed to the White-vented
Myna becoming the more common myna in Singapore.

<h> Our Friends or Foes? </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-024#85:2>
Plants and animals are integral to our environment.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-024#86:2>
Yet their existence is often taken for granted and their importance
to Man is overlooked.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-024#87:2>
To help pupils appreciate the roles of plants and animals in our
environment, it is necessary to make pupils aware of Man's dependence on
other living organisms.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-024#88:2>
At the same time, pupils should know that there are a number of
plants and animals that can be harmful to Man.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-024#89:2>
However, it must be impressed on pupils that whether a living
organism is helpful or harmful usually depends on the situation.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-024#90:2>
For example, in the preceding chapter, pupils learned that
decomposers are essential to the natural environment.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-024#91:2>
On the other hand, in this chapter pupils learn that decomposers can
be harmful in that they destroy a lot of food and other materials.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-024#92:2>
At the end of this chapter, pupils should

<ICE-SIN:W2B-024#93:2>
1) be able to describe how some plants and animals are useful.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-024#94:2>
2) be able to describe how some plants and animals are harmful.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-024#95:2>
3) know some methods Man uses to control harmful animals.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-024#96:2>
4) know the cause of food decay.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-024#97:2>
5) be able to describe common methods of food preservation.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-024#98:2>
From the human point of view, an animal or a plant is often regarded
as distinctively helpful or harmful.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-024#99:2>
As mentioned earlier, it actually depends on the situation.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-024#100:2>
Even then, it is not easy to tell whether a given organism is being
helpful or harmful.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-024#101:2>
Hence, many a time judgement has to be suspended.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-024#102:2>
One important fact we have to recognize is that every living
organism is part of and important to the global community.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-024#103:2>
We, humans, depend on the rest of this community.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-024#104:2>
With increasing global concern about the preservation of Nature, it
is important to emphasize that plants which are used by Man should be
specially cultivated.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-024#105:2>
In this way, we do not deplete natural resources.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-024#106:2>
Plants can be useful in the following ways.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-024#107:2>
1) Plants replenish the atmosphere with oxygen during the process of
photosynthesis.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-024#108:2>
2) Many plants are grown for food.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-024#109:2>
3) Many plants are grown for the manufacture of medicine and other
healthcare products. <X>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-024#X110:2>
4) Some plants provide us with useful materials to make the objects
we need. </X> </I>
