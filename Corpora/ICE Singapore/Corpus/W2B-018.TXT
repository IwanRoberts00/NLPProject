<h> Building a New Niche: The Story of Dr David B.H Chew </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-018#2:1>
<h> Chapter 1 </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-018#3:1>
<h> Forsaking the Good Life </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-018#4:1>
People emigrate for various reasons - not getting anywhere in life at
home; feeling stifled by the political system; uprooting because of marriage;
or wishing to spend the remaining years of their lives in a new environment,
and so on.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-018#5:1>
The first point was what drove most of the thousands of hopeful
Malayans to Singapore after World War II; pouring down south to seek a better
economic future for themselves and their children.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-018#6:1>
Singapore was like a welcoming beacon of hope, the land of promise.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-018#7:1>
Never mind the politics.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-018#8:1>
In 1949, a tall, slim youngster of 18 named David Chew Beng Hwee from
the Malayan east coast state of Trengganu joined the migration.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-018#9:1>
But his reason for forsaking his motherland was the reverse of the
norm.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-018#10:1>
Strangely, this young man wanted to escape from the good life he was
enjoying in his hometown.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-018#11:1>
He was not compelled to leave by economic circumstances.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-018#12:1>
That was the marked difference between him and his less fortunate
fellow emigres.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-018#13:1>
They did not have his options.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-018#14:1>
The handsome Malayan lad with slant eyes under black bushy eyebrows
had his life all cut out for him in the land of kain songket, giant
leatherneck turtles and miles of golden sands.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-018#15:1>
A fifth generation Chew from Fukian, he was born with a golden spoon
in his mouth.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-018#16:1>
He did not count his pennies.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-018#17:1>
The Chew household of four boys and a girl prosperous and
distinguished land-owning family.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-018#18:1>
They were honoured and respected by the local community.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-018#19:1>
David's father, the late Chew Woon Kiat, commanded acres of valuable
real estate in the choice areas of Trengganu, the state's capital.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-018#20:1>
At shophouse No 222 Kedai Payang, the enterprising Mr Chew also
conducted a flourishing retail trade in a host of sundry items such as kain
songhet - that colourful, exquisitely designed cloth for which Trengganu is
famous.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-018#21:1>
His client list was an illustrious one, including royalty and British
colonial advisors and officials.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-018#22:1>
Added to that, the Chews claimed a distinguished ancestry going back
three generations.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-018#23:1>
David's great-grandfather was the Kapitan China of Trengganu.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-018#24:1>
He was the head of the state's Chinese community appointed by the
Sultan to keep the peace.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-018#25:1>
He a leading citizen and entrepreneur who helped build the bedrock of
Trengganu's social and economic life early 1800s.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-018#26:1>
The family business suffered only a slight setback during the
calamitous Japanese military occupation of Malaya in the early 1940s, when
David was in his early teens.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-018#27:1>
The Chews were noted for their humility.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-018#28:1>
They never looked down on others or flaunted their wealth.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-018#29:1>
They lived simply, occupying the upper floors in shophouse No 222.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-018#30:1>
Mother did most of the housekeeping.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-018#31:1>
" Our house was a good training ground for character building," David
recalls.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-018#32:1>
Our father often told us never to show off, never to take anything
for granted.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-018#33:1>
He told us to work hard.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-018#34:1>
David describes his father as a strict disciplinarian, but a fair
minded man and his mother, Wee Tuan Joo, as a gentle, caring and devoted Mum.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-018#35:1>
They were good and loving parents.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-018#36:1>
David and his three brothers, Beng Teck, Beng Chiat and Beng Keng,
attended the Sultan Sulaiman English School.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-018#37:1>
Sister Siok Chin attended Wei Sin Chinese Primary School.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-018#38:1>
Truly, the young David had no reasons to complain, growing up in that
enviable environment of fame and fortune with his siblings.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-018#39:1>
He found nothing wanting.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-018#40:1>
His future was secure.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-018#41:1>
Placed in that delightful situation, most offsprings of wealthy
parents would just wait for the opportunity to grab their share and bask in
luxury for the rest of their lives, without doing a stroke of work.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-018#42:1>
Yet David, the fourth child and third son, was unhappy.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-018#43:1>
He woke up one day and decided that that kind of life was not for
him.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-018#44:1>
It was too easy and too comfortable.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-018#45:1>
He actually became disenchanted with it as he grew older.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-018#46:1>
He wanted to carve his own living, to be the architect of his own
fortune.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-018#47:1>
He was prepared to rough it out to fulfill his ambition.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-018#48:1>
He believed success must be earned, not inherited.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-018#49:1>
An illuminating passage in a book entitled Self Help by poet and
author, Samuel Smiles, had a great influence on him.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-018#50:1>
The passage, etched forever in his mind, says: The youth who inherits
wealth is apt to have life made too easy for him, and he soon grows sated
with it, because he has nothing left to desire.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-018#51:1>
Having no special object to struggle for, he finds time hangs heavy
on his mind; he remains morally and spiritually asleep; and his position in
society is often no higher than that of polypus over which the tide flows.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-018#52:1>
Well, the restless and ambitious boy was not about to be a
sea-anemone, lying at the bottom of the ocean with no aspiration, just
surviving.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-018#53:1>
His father's oft-repeated advice to work hard strengthened his
conviction and resolve.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-018#54:1>
He chose Singapore for his new life.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-018#55:1>
He had heard of the great opportunities offered by the southern city.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-018#56:1>
His father had once taken him there on a visit and he liked it.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-018#57:1>
Thousands of other Malayans were moving there.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-018#58:1>
David shared his dream with his parents sometime in 1949 after
getting his Senior Cambridge School Certificate from Sultan Sulaiman English
School.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-018#59:1>
They did not a fuss.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-018#60:1>
However, they were worried about his future.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-018#61:1>
" Singapore is a very competitive place," said he.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-018#62:1>
" Can you make it?

<ICE-SIN:W2B-018#63:1>
Can you endure the hardships?"

<ICE-SIN:W2B-018#64:1>
" I'll try," David replied.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-018#65:1>
" I'm determined to be somebody on my own.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-018#66:1>
I'll ask Uncle Woon Poh to help me look for a job".

<ICE-SIN:W2B-018#67:1>
David wrote to his uncle in Singapore.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-018#68:1>
The late Woon Poh ( his father's eldest brother), lived at Kurau.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-018#69:1>
A bachelor, he was a director of several companies including Boustead
Rubber Estate and Public Life Insurance.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-018#70:1>
As a prominent businessman with good contacts, he was the right man
to approach.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-018#71:1>
While waiting for his uncle's reply, David looked for a temporary
job.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-018#72:1>
He might as well start earning his keep and get some work experience.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-018#73:1>
He found a clerical post in the Chief Police Officer's Department,
Kuala Tren Police Force.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-018#74:1>
One anxious month passed, then two.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-018#75:1>
There was no news from Uncle Woon Poh.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-018#76:1>
David lost hope.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-018#77:1>
Not wanting to bother his busy uncle too much, he applied for a job
in several organisations in Kuala Lumpur.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-018#78:1>
The Malayan capital would be a good alternative to Singapore.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-018#79:1>
In October, one of these organisations, the Immigration Department,
called him for an interview.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-018#80:1>
He took a bus to attend the interview in Kota Bahru, Kelantan.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-018#81:1>
Barely had he returned to Trengganu when the reply from Singapore
came.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-018#82:1>
Uncle Woon Poh had arranged a job for David at the Malayan Airways as
a Traffic Officer.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-018#83:1>
David was to come down to Singapore as soon as possible and see Alan
Bohm, the Traffic Manager.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-018#84:1>
David was in seventh heaven.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-018#85:1>
He did not give the offer a second thought.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-018#86:1>
He wrote back, accepting the post.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-018#87:1>
He broke the happy news to his family.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-018#88:1>
Swiftly, he settled his personal affairs and made preparations for
his journey.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-018#89:1>
He would take a boat.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-018#90:1>
He booked his passage on the Ho Hong which was leaving in November.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-018#91:1>
The fare was
&dollar;5.50 for berth only.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-018#92:1>
David chose sea travel because it was the best, safest and cheapest
for him at the time.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-018#93:1>
To fly would have been expensive and since there was no direct air
service between Trengganu and Singapore, he would have had to motor to Kuala
Lumpur to catch a flight.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-018#94:1>
Also, road and rail travel was risky because of the Communist
insurgency.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-018#95:1>
There was a bit of drama on the day of his departure.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-018#96:1>
He received the result of his interview with the Immigration
Department in Kota Bahru.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-018#97:1>
He was successful and would be posted there.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-018#98:1>
In all the excitement of his preparation to depart, he had forgotten
about the interview with the Immigration Department.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-018#99:1>
He says today that if that letter had come before Uncle Woon Poh's
reply, he would have accepted the Kota Bahru appointment.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-018#100:1>
But David Chew was destined to come to Singapore.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-018#101:1>
It was written in the stars.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-018#102:1>
There was no turning back now.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-018#103:1>
The wealthy landowner's son sailed off with only a small amount of
cash ( about
&dollar;100) in his pocket, saved up from his salary, and a small suitcase of his
personal belonging.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-018#104:1>
He wanted to start from scratch.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-018#105:1>
He harboured no illusions about what lay ahead of him in Singapore.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-018#106:1>
He knew what leaving the land of milk an honey for a tough world
meant.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-018#107:1>
Indeed, he had his first taste of the harsh realities of his new
life on the way south.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-018#108:1>
The sea voyage was very rough and uncomfortable.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-018#109:1>
Th Ho Hong was no luxury liner offering clean, finely furnished
cabins and white-coated stewards dancing attendance to his every need.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-018#110:1>
It was a small coastal cargo vessel plying along the east coast of
Malaya, transporting rubber and other products, and passengers who did not
care about travelling in style.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-018#111:1>
As a freighter, the boat had only four cabins, one each for the
captain, the purser, the engineer, and European passengers.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-018#112:1>
David and the rest of the 30-odd Asia travellers ( mostly
fellow-emigrants) were deck passengers.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-018#113:1>
They slept on hard bunks in a large common room in the stifling
lower deck with shared facilities.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-018#114:1>
The skimpy menu for the deck passengers, consisting mainly of fried
noodles and fried rice, did not go down well with him either.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-018#115:1>
Nothing like the comforts of home for the youngster born to wealthy
parents.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-018#116:1>
But for a fare of
&dollar;5.50 excluding meals, he could not ask for more.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-018#117:1>
To make matters worse, the little ship pitched and rolled alarmingly
on the rough waters of the South China Sea as it chugged sluggishly through
the waves for two agonising days and one night.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-018#118:1>
At one point, the young man felt really ill.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-018#119:1>
He was glad to be on terra firma again as the Ho Hong finally sai1ed
into Singapore that November afternoon.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-018#120:1>
From the landing point, Johnson Pier ( now Cliff David Chew took a
taxi to Uncle Woon Poh's Telok Kurau, Katong.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-018#121:1>
The next morning, his heart beating with high anticipation, the
Malayan Airways' new Traff1c Officer reported for work.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-018#122:1>
The Traffic Manager, Alan Bohm, outlined his duties which included
the checking of the arrivals and departures of passengers at the airport then
at Kallang.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-018#123:1>
David was then introduced to his immediate superior, Ho Poey Kee,
the Senior Traffic Officer.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-018#124:1>
The young emigre from Trengganu had completed the first step of his
long, long journey to his dream.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-018#125:1>
Ahead of him lay the unknown.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-018#126:1>
He was on his own in a new country.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-018#127:1>
<h> Chapter 2 </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-018#128:1>
<h> Drama at Malayan Airways </h>

<ICE-SIN:W2B-018#129:1>
There are three kinds of people - those who make things happen,
those who watch things happen, and those who say, " What happened?"

<ICE-SIN:W2B-018#130:1>
David Chew easily fits the first category.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-018#131:1>
He is no fence-sitter.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-018#132:1>
The emigre from Trengganu loves getting into the thick of things,
either to start something or just lend a hand to a cause he considers worthy
of support.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-018#133:1>
The man of action is never one to refuse a challenge.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-018#134:1>
With him, it seems that the sparks are always flying.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-018#135:1>
In his senior years at Sultan Sulaiman English School, the
landowner's son bore many of his alma mater's activities on his young
shoulders.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-018#136:1>
He was also a source of inspiration to his mates as he led them as
house captain, school prefect and captain of the basketball and table-tennis
teams.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-018#137:1>
Self-assured and outgoing, David did not exactly take Singapore by
storm.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-018#138:1>
But since sailing in on the heaving Ho Hong that November afternoon
in 1949 to work as a Traffic Officer for Malayan Airways, he has displayed
his calibre numerous times as he engaged himself in domestic affairs, as one
might say.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-018#139:1>
His local adventures began in the airline itself, his very first
place of employment in his adopted country. <X> Indeed, the opening chapter
of the drama affected his own career.

<ICE-SIN:W2B-018#X140:1>
David's career in the airline started normally enough. </X> </I>
