<ICE-SIN:S2A-054#1:1:A>
This is the HDTV system and it is uhm eleven twenty five lines

<ICE-SIN:S2A-054#2:1:A>
It's double of the NTSC system in in the in the world currently
using today because uhm this has got double the resolution of that end
<unclear> word </unclear>

<ICE-SIN:S2A-054#3:1:A>
This is the uh NTSC laser disc player which gives the signal compar
com comparable to this screen

<ICE-SIN:S2A-054#4:1:A>
Only these two can work together you see

<ICE-SIN:S2A-054#5:1:A>
Because for the first time Kodak has has done a combined research
and for the first time experimental uh film transferred through HDTV telecine

<ICE-SIN:S2A-054#6:1:A>
Normally film is transferred to uh TV as in broadcast video you see

<ICE-SIN:S2A-054#7:1:A>
But that is that is on a PAL system in Singapore for instance six
two five lines and that like commercials they usually film it on film and
then after that they go through a post-production telecine

<ICE-SIN:S2A-054#8:1:A>
How to transfer the film to video and that quality is only six two
five lines

<ICE-SIN:S2A-054#9:1:A>
But for the first time Kodak is able to transfer film to HDTV
through the HDTV telecine into HDTV format on the laser disc and this crisp
quality of resolution that you see here is all generated on the film

<ICE-SIN:S2A-054#10:1:A>
This particular one is shown on thirty-five mm film and some of the
footages that you see are from either movies or from music videos that are
shot in US and around the world

<ICE-SIN:S2A-054#11:1:A>
And you can see the quality of the colour saturation

<ICE-SIN:S2A-054#12:1:A>
There is a particular one which is very very good

<ICE-SIN:S2A-054#13:1:A>
This one

<ICE-SIN:S2A-054#14:1:A>
This is a music video

<ICE-SIN:S2A-054#15:1:A>
You you you can watch the uh the quality the highlights the shadows
and it's very very clear

<ICE-SIN:S2A-054#16:1:A>
If ever any broadcasting uh stations in the world which switch over
to HDTV maybe maybe Japan or or uh in Europe others will follow see like SBC

<ICE-SIN:S2A-054#17:1:A>
They if they tend if they if they sort of like have the intention
to go towards this direction maybe in ten years' time everybody would have to
shoot on film to be able to get this quality and in fact as we are talking
now a lot of people instead of shooting on video

<ICE-SIN:S2A-054#18:1:A>
They are going back to shooting on film even if it's sixteen mm

<ICE-SIN:S2A-054#19:1:A>
Later on after this I'll show you footages of sixteen mm transfer
and they are just as good

<ICE-SIN:S2A-054#20:1:A>
Look at the quality of the

<ICE-SIN:S2A-054#21:1:A>
Now I'll show you some footages which are transferred from sixteen
mm film

<ICE-SIN:S2A-054#22:1:A>
Ya this is shown on sixteen mm blown up to thirty-five and
transferred

<ICE-SIN:S2A-054#23:1:A>
You can see the quality

<ICE-SIN:S2A-054#24:1:A>
It's just as good

<ICE-SIN:S2A-054#25:1:A>
At the moment it's the first time they did a film transfer direct

<ICE-SIN:S2A-054#26:1:A>
It's it's possible

<ICE-SIN:S2A-054#27:1:A>
In fact all the laser discs that you see they're all transferred
directly from film to laser laser disc

<ICE-SIN:S2A-054#28:1:A>
That's why you can see it

<ICE-SIN:S2A-054#29:1:A>
You see currently

<ICE-SIN:S2A-054#30:1:A>
Oh no no no

<ICE-SIN:S2A-054#31:1:A>
I mean not a lot of people does that but for the first time it's
able to do a high definition laser disc you see from film transfer so that
you see

<ICE-SIN:S2A-054#32:1:A>
Because right now nobody is broadcasting in this kind of signal so
if if you do not have this player there will be no output you see

<ICE-SIN:S2A-054#33:1:A>
So no we can't view anything because SBC <unclear> word </unclear>
broadcasting <unclear> word </unclear> frequencies and and they are on a
system which is six two five lines PAL and this is not not compatible to to N
uh to HDTV standard which is twice of that you see

<ICE-SIN:S2A-054#34:1:A>
So they for the first time we give you this film transfer to laser
disc so that you can view it here to see the crisp quality of film transfer
to HDTV </I>


<I>

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-054#35:2:B>
Okay

<ICE-SIN:S2A-054#36:2:B>
I represent Singapore Telecom International which markets a service
a data communication service called Infonet and Infonet is an ex twenty five
package switching network which operates on the ex twenty five protocol

<ICE-SIN:S2A-054#37:2:B>
Now a protocol is actually a pathway so to speak which transports
data from one end to another

<ICE-SIN:S2A-054#38:2:B>
In other words if you are in Singapore and you would like to
communicate with someone in Los Angeles in the States for instance you would
use your computer type it on a software have it saved and transmitted to a
mail box and it resides there till the other party in the United States
decides to retrieve it

<ICE-SIN:S2A-054#39:2:B>
Now alternatively we have got another service which calls which is
called a list line kind of service which simply means that you are connected
directly to your user on the other end which wherever it may be around the
world and it is transmitted real time immediately

<ICE-SIN:S2A-054#40:2:B>
In other words you are connected directly like you're making a
phone call and it is your data is transmitted directly

<ICE-SIN:S2A-054#41:2:B>
Now it really depends on what the customer requires

<ICE-SIN:S2A-054#42:2:B>
If the customer requires a service which uh is affected by time
differential in other words if you're speaking to London and there's a seven
and a half hour difference you would want to ensure that your message is
retrieved received by your counterpart in the United Kingdom

<ICE-SIN:S2A-054#43:2:B>
So what you would do is you would subscribe to electronic mail
service which essentially means you have you would have an IBM compatible PC
and buy the software from us

<ICE-SIN:S2A-054#44:2:B>
The software would would then be like a postbox where you store
your information as in a word processing software much like WordPerfect
WordStar and nuh put into the network

<ICE-SIN:S2A-054#45:2:B>
Now once it is in the network your user on the other end could just
use the similar the same kind of software that you have in Singapore dial up
into the system and retrieve the information

<ICE-SIN:S2A-054#46:2:B>
Now it sounds pretty technical because I really don't have my uh
slides at the moment but uh basically it's an electronic mail mail postman

<ICE-SIN:S2A-054#47:2:B>
Imagine that uh on this end you would like to post a letter

<ICE-SIN:S2A-054#48:2:B>
What you do then is to go to the postbox put it into the postbox
the postman comes and collects it puts it into his truck drives it to the
post office where it's sorted and sent to the various districts

<ICE-SIN:S2A-054#49:2:B>
Now once it has reached the various districts it would then be
delivered to the households that have have uh been it has been the letters
have been addressed to

<ICE-SIN:S2A-054#50:2:B>
Now this is similar but in an our service is similar to this
principle except that it is electronically done

<ICE-SIN:S2A-054#51:2:B>
What we do is that instead of the postman we have the software and
the software is connected to a modem which is connected to a telephone line

<ICE-SIN:S2A-054#52:2:B>
Now what you do is you type your information onto the software save
it it is then transferred by the modem to the telephone line to the network

<ICE-SIN:S2A-054#53:2:B>
Now in the network that would be your post office your general post
office where the information is collated and distributed

<ICE-SIN:S2A-054#54:2:B>
In other words it is sorted and sent to the people that you are
addressing it to

<ICE-SIN:S2A-054#55:2:B>
Now when your parties on the other end decide to take the letters
from the post office like a PO box they tap into the the network and re and
basically get the information from them which means that they get the letter

<ICE-SIN:S2A-054#56:2:B>
So that is uh basically how an electronic mail service works much
like a conventional post office system except that you don't see it

<ICE-SIN:S2A-054#57:2:B>
It is it works through electricity and and what have you the
electronic gadgetry that's available in high technology at this point in time

<ICE-SIN:S2A-054#58:2:B>
Is there anything else that I could uh interest you in beside uh
the electronic mail service </I>


<I>

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S2A-054#59:3:C>
Uhm okay uh I'll teach you how to uh go go back to the uh

<ICE-SIN:S2A-054#60:3:C>
Yes to lock out uh lock out type L O G O U T okay

<ICE-SIN:S2A-054#61:3:C>
Uhm you have to choose Unix to F T P to Leonis alright

<ICE-SIN:S2A-054#62:3:C>
Ya

<ICE-SIN:S2A-054#63:3:C>
Because you have to load the file from the P C to the to the uh to
Leonis

<ICE-SIN:S2A-054#64:3:C>
Do I have any files inside

<ICE-SIN:S2A-054#65:3:C>
I will I will try to F T P some of the files on hard disk

<ICE-SIN:S2A-054#66:3:C>
F T P means file transfer protocol or file transfer

<ICE-SIN:S2A-054#67:3:C>
Ya file transfer protocol

<ICE-SIN:S2A-054#68:3:C>
Protocol meaning uh a kind of language lah a language

<ICE-SIN:S2A-054#69:3:C>
So user I D for logging on to Leonis

<ICE-SIN:S2A-054#70:3:C>
You have to log on to the host first which is uh C C E P Y F for me
and then password

<ICE-SIN:S2A-054#71:3:C>
I'm trying to transfer some of the files to the uh Leonis

<ICE-SIN:S2A-054#72:3:C>
Leonis is the Greek name for lion

<ICE-SIN:S2A-054#73:3:C>
Okay we are actually logged in already

<ICE-SIN:S2A-054#74:3:C>
Okay

<ICE-SIN:S2A-054#75:3:C>
Uhm there are a few commands that you need to remember

<ICE-SIN:S2A-054#76:3:C>
One is uh okay you must be sure what kind of files you are
transferring

<ICE-SIN:S2A-054#77:3:C>
Firstly uhm firstly is it a binary file or ASCII file

<ICE-SIN:S2A-054#78:3:C>
Uh let's say if you it's a text file text you don't have to specify
anything right

<ICE-SIN:S2A-054#79:3:C>
What you need to do is uh just uh do a V R R and see if your files
are there

<ICE-SIN:S2A-054#80:3:C>
Uh sorry

<ICE-SIN:S2A-054#81:3:C>
This is uh Leonis host directory

<ICE-SIN:S2A-054#82:3:C>
Uh local directory L D I R list local local directory

<ICE-SIN:S2A-054#83:3:C>
This is my H drive

<ICE-SIN:S2A-054#84:3:C>
What how you change how to change to how to change it to B uh A
sorry

<ICE-SIN:S2A-054#85:3:C>
To change it to A what you should do is uh you you type drive
change local drive to A okay

<ICE-SIN:S2A-054#86:3:C>
That's how you change

<ICE-SIN:S2A-054#87:3:C>
If you don't want to change also can

<ICE-SIN:S2A-054#88:3:C>
What you should what you need to do is that you just put A put A
uhm something something you must specify the path lah

<ICE-SIN:S2A-054#89:3:C>
You know what I mean

<ICE-SIN:S2A-054#90:3:C>
But uh if you want to leave the directory you have to change it
okay to see if your A your files is inside diskette before you do any
transfer okay

<ICE-SIN:S2A-054#91:3:C>
Uh fail found

<ICE-SIN:S2A-054#92:3:C>
Okay there are two commands

<ICE-SIN:S2A-054#93:3:C>
One is to put one is to get because your F T P from your Nusnet
right

<ICE-SIN:S2A-054#94:3:C>
That means your F T P from P C

<ICE-SIN:S2A-054#95:3:C>
To F T P for P C means you want to uh put a file into Leonis

<ICE-SIN:S2A-054#96:3:C>
That is called putting

<ICE-SIN:S2A-054#97:3:C>
So you put put put A colon file name file name extension alright

<ICE-SIN:S2A-054#98:3:C>
If you are already in A colon now you already A colon you have to
you don't have to put A colon

<ICE-SIN:S2A-054#99:3:C>
<O> Question </O>

<ICE-SIN:S2A-054#100:3:C>
If you don't specify file name default file name same same as the
uh when it's being transfer over to Leonis you'll be you will have the same
file extension okay

<ICE-SIN:S2A-054#101:3:C>
But uh you hit double enter means default file name same okay

<ICE-SIN:S2A-054#102:3:C>
Uh not reading because no file there

<ICE-SIN:S2A-054#103:3:C>
Now what I want to do is uh I will try a file on my H drive which
I have you see okay

<ICE-SIN:S2A-054#104:3:C>
Say I try a very small file say uhm uhm no no my confi is not here

<ICE-SIN:S2A-054#105:3:C>
I will try say three zero three message

<ICE-SIN:S2A-054#106:3:C>
I hope is a small one alright

<ICE-SIN:S2A-054#107:3:C>
I put three zero three to Leonis

<ICE-SIN:S2A-054#108:3:C>
Oh dear I must try to change back uh forgot

<ICE-SIN:S2A-054#109:3:C>
Try to change back to to H okay

<ICE-SIN:S2A-054#110:3:C>
Put uhm three zero three dot sign S two

<ICE-SIN:S2A-054#111:3:C>
That's why I can't teach too much because some people may not be
able to absorb everything too complicated for them

<ICE-SIN:S2A-054#112:3:C>
Transfer successful

<ICE-SIN:S2A-054#113:3:C>
<O> Question </O>

<ICE-SIN:S2A-054#114:3:C>
I do a D I R I see the file there

<ICE-SIN:S2A-054#115:3:C>
There three zero three

<ICE-SIN:S2A-054#116:3:C>
It's transferred on November the tenth

<ICE-SIN:S2A-054#117:3:C>
This is how I did

<ICE-SIN:S2A-054#118:3:C>
<O> Question </O>

<ICE-SIN:S2A-054#119:3:C>
I'm already in Leonis actually but you cannot do Pie <unclear>
word </unclear>

<ICE-SIN:S2A-054#120:3:C>
Here you have to log on to Leonis again

<ICE-SIN:S2A-054#121:3:C>
Uh I choose default right so it's the same file name

<ICE-SIN:S2A-054#122:3:C>
Three zero three M S D

<ICE-SIN:S2A-054#123:3:C>
It needs a bit of practice

<ICE-SIN:S2A-054#124:3:C>
The the booklet I'm sure they list it

<ICE-SIN:S2A-054#125:3:C>
I'm showing you ya some of the more complicated

<ICE-SIN:S2A-054#126:3:C>
Too brief ya

<ICE-SIN:S2A-054#127:3:C>
That's why you have to uh you see some demonstration here </I>
