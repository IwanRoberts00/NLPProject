<ICE-SIN:S2B-016#2:1:A>
Good evening

<ICE-SIN:S2B-016#3:1:A>
The headlines

<ICE-SIN:S2B-016#4:1:A>

At home primary education's to be the Education Ministry's top
priority

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S2B-016#7:1:B>
The Education Ministry's priority in the coming years will be
to improve the quality of primary education Speaking at the Opening of the
Thirty-Sixth World Assembly of the International Council on Education for
teaching

<ICE-SIN:S2B-016#8:1:B>
The Education Minister says pupils will be able to build a firm
foundation before going to secondary schools

<ICE-SIN:S2B-016#9:1:B>
He said that an increasingly well-educated population will demand a
better education system to develop the talent and potential of their children

<ICE-SIN:S2B-016#10:1:B>
A study by his ministry has shown that there's been a significant
upgrading in the eh education level of parents with primary one pupils

<ICE-SIN:S2B-016#11:1:B>
Dr Tan also stressed that improving the education system is a
process which may have a beginning but no end

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S2B-016#12:1:A>
Each step or improvement that we make throws up new challenges
which we have a responsibility to address

<ICE-SIN:S2B-016#13:1:A>
The progress which we in Singapore have made in the last
twenty-five years is encouraging because it shows that with effort
determination and very important adequate financial provision we
can improve the quality of the teaching force and raise the
standard of education in a country

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S2B-016#14:1:B>
Improvement of primary level education will be the subject of
discussion at the schools council meeting tomorrow

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S2B-016#15:1:A>
The Labour Ministry and all its departments will be relocated
to its new premises at Havelock Road from the sixth of next month

<ICE-SIN:S2B-016#16:1:A>
With the move it'll make some changes to the work permit procedures

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S2B-016#17:1:B>
The Work Permit department now at Princep Street processes
documents according to eight schemes

<ICE-SIN:S2B-016#18:1:B>
The Labour Ministry says as a result a few counters are extremely
busy and others not so

<ICE-SIN:S2B-016#19:1:B>
But at the new seven-storey building the department will have
common application collection and cancellation counters and with the new
system shorter waiting time for the public as its staff can be more flexibly
deployed

<ICE-SIN:S2B-016#20:1:B>
Also the Ministry will issue visit passes on behalf of the
Immigration Department

<ICE-SIN:S2B-016#21:1:B>
There'll be two other changes in applying for work permits for
non-Malays in foreign workers

<ICE-SIN:S2B-016#22:1:B>
Employers will not have to report the arrival of their workers and
revenue stamps are allowed on security bonds

<ICE-SIN:S2B-016#23:1:B>
To facilitate the shift at the new building the Work Permit
department will be closed for three days from the second of next month except
for a counter for emergency cancellation of work permits

<ICE-SIN:S2B-016#24:1:B>
Visitors to the new building can also look forward to other better
facilities

<ICE-SIN:S2B-016#25:1:B>
Several meeting rooms are available for those who need to settle
disagreement

<ICE-SIN:S2B-016#26:1:B>
And from next January the Ministry will have a permanent exhibition
centre on occupational safety and health

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S2B-016#27:1:A>
Electricity and gas will cost less from the next three months

<ICE-SIN:S2B-016#28:1:A>
Electricity tariffs will go down on average by five percent gas
tariffs by four percent

<ICE-SIN:S2B-016#29:1:A>
The PUB says this is due to a drop in fuel prices and savings in
operational cost

<ICE-SIN:S2B-016#30:1:A>
The next review will be in November

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S2B-016#31:1:B>
The Housing and Development Board's offering three hundred and
sixty units of flats in Woodlands New Town for booking

<ICE-SIN:S2B-016#32:1:B>
Therefore applicants who registered to buy flats before the third
of July last year have been assigned to that new town

<ICE-SIN:S2B-016#33:1:B>
On offer ninety executive flats a hundred five-room flats and a
hundred and seventy four-room flats The prices range from fifty thousand five
hundred to a hundred and thirty thousand one hundred dollars the lowest among
the new towns

<ICE-SIN:S2B-016#34:1:B>
The HDB says each unit of the executive flats will be a jumbo flat
created by combining a three-room and a four-room flat

<ICE-SIN:S2B-016#35:1:B>
Booking for the executive and five-room flats will start tomorrow
and for the four-room flats next month

<ICE-SIN:S2B-016#36:1:B>
Those who book their flats can expect to get their keys in one to
two years' time

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S2B-016#37:1:A>
A greater variety of rice will be available for consumers from
October

<ICE-SIN:S2B-016#38:1:A>
Current import rules for rice will be relaxed and importers will be
allowed to buy all types and grades of rice

<ICE-SIN:S2B-016#39:1:A>
The Trade and Industry Ministry says the change will come with the
introduction of labelling regulations

<ICE-SIN:S2B-016#40:1:A>
All rice bags will have to carry information on the type of rice
grain composition net weight and brand They must also have the name and
address of the importer or local distributor

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S2B-016#41:1:B>
With the labelling and liberalization of uh imports of rice
consumers will have an advantage in that they can make informed choices

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S2B-016#42:1:A>
The price of rice will not increase because uh labelling costs
are only a very small proportion of the cost which consumer will pay

<ICE-SIN:S2B-016#43:1:A>
Uhm I think with this labelling there should be greater variety for
consumers to choose from

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S2B-016#44:1:B>
As an importer we will benefit by diversifying our sources of
supply and I think this is a good business practice

<ICE-SIN:S2B-016#45:1:B>
As a retailer we would be able to offer more variety to our
consumer and at the same time offer him lower prices

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S2B-016#46:1:A>
The Wishing Singapore Well has helped raise more than three

And at home the Education Ministry's plans for new syllabus
for Malay as a third language

<$D> 
<ICE-SIN:S2B-016#74:2:D>
A new syllabus is being planned for teaching Malay as a third
language or ML3

<ICE-SIN:S2B-016#75:2:D>
The Education Ministry expects to launch it in nineteen ninety two
in secondary one and two simultaneously

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S2B-016#76:2:C>
We're going to emphasise more on the uh cultural component
because we thought by having this component expand it in its particular area
then the uh student will know more about the Malay culture value system
psychology or even philosophy of the Malays

<$D> 
<ICE-SIN:S2B-016#77:2:D>
ML3's been offered as an O-level subject to non-Malays
among the top ten percent of PSLE students since nineteen eighty six

<ICE-SIN:S2B-016#78:2:D>
They take four years to study what their Malay counterparts do in
ten years in primary and secondary school

<ICE-SIN:S2B-016#79:2:D>
Mr Sidek said the Ministry hopes to find a suitable program that's
of the standard of Malay as a second language for secondary two students

<ICE-SIN:S2B-016#80:2:D>
There are ninety-five students taking ML3 at present

<ICE-SIN:S2B-016#81:2:D>
With the introduction of the new syllabus Mr Sidek said the
Ministry hopes to have about thirty students taking it each year

<ICE-SIN:S2B-016#82:2:D>
He was speaking at an award ceremony for a social studies
exhibition which saw about one hundred and twenty primary school entries for
the first time

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S2B-016#83:2:C>
For the past four years only schools with social science clubs
could join the contest but this year it was opened to all

<ICE-SIN:S2B-016#84:2:C>
And because of the large response each school could only send in
three entries

<ICE-SIN:S2B-016#85:2:C>
The primary fours fives and sixes worked on whatever caught their
interest

<ICE-SIN:S2B-016#86:2:C>
The themes range from environmental issues to our multi-cultural
multi-religious society

<ICE-SIN:S2B-016#87:2:C>
The students didn't get any help from their teachers

<ICE-SIN:S2B-016#88:2:C>
They chose the subject did the research and put the pieces together
all on their own and they could only use scrap material

<ICE-SIN:S2B-016#89:2:C>
Zhong Ker Ping and her two friends from Mayflower Primary chose
communications because they say it's a wide-ranging topic and it was easy to
do research on it

<$D> 
<ICE-SIN:S2B-016#90:2:D>
The Newspaper and Printing Presses Amendment Act goes into
effect next month and certain offshore publications will need a permit to
circulate in Singapore

<ICE-SIN:S2B-016#91:2:D>
They're mostly daily or weekly publications which have a
circulation of three hundred or more and which carry reports about the
politics and current events of Singapore and other South-East Asian countries

<ICE-SIN:S2B-016#92:2:D>
The Communications and Information Ministry says there're now
seventeen such publications Fourteen of them had been exempted from getting a
permit as they don't carry regular reports on Singapore and have not
interfered with our domestic affairs

<ICE-SIN:S2B-016#93:2:D>
But three other regional publications AsiaWeek Yachochokan and
Media will need permits

<ICE-SIN:S2B-016#94:2:D>
The Far Eastern Economic Review and the Asian Wall Street Journal
aren't affected as they've stopped circulation in Singapore

<ICE-SIN:S2B-016#95:2:D>
But they must apply for permits if they want to resume circulation

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S2B-016#96:2:C>

At the surgery suite where patients can have their surgery
performed in the morning and be discharged the same day has been opened at
the Kendang Kerbau Hospital

<ICE-SIN:S2B-016#99:2:D>
This will help make more hospital beds available for other patients

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S2B-016#100:2:C>
So far KK's channelled about twenty percent of its
gynaecological cases to day surgery

<ICE-SIN:S2B-016#101:2:C>
It hopes to increase this in the future as the hospital moves to a
new site where four day surgery suites have been planned to handle more
patients and new anaesthetic drugs which help the patients to regain
consciousness in just minutes will help this

<ICE-SIN:S2B-016#102:2:C>
With these drugs patients can be up and about in just a short time
and they can go home in just two hours

<ICE-SIN:S2B-016#103:2:C>
Doctors say that the mobility helps them to recover faster

<ICE-SIN:S2B-016#104:2:C>
There'll also psychological advantages if the patient knows she
can go home the same day

<$D> 
<ICE-SIN:S2B-016#105:2:D>
It's less traumatic to the family when uh the mother is uh
not separated from the family for a day or two

<$C> 
<ICE-SIN:S2B-016#106:2:C>
It's part of the trend to treat patients as outpatients
whenever possible

<ICE-SIN:S2B-016#107:2:C>
It makes surgery more convenient less costly

<ICE-SIN:S2B-016#108:2:C>
As for health care for the elderly this will be made more
available with more centres catering to their needs soon in large housing
estates

<$D> 
<ICE-SIN:S2B-016#109:2:D>
Growing population rising need for health care to prepare for
it six more senior citizens health care centres like this one at Toa Payoh
will be built over the next three years

<ICE-SIN:S2B-016#110:2:D>
Together with the present four centres the Health Ministry says
it's sufficient to provide medical care for those sixty years and above who
then make up ten percent of Singapore's population <X>

<ICE-SIN:S2B-016#X111:2:D>
They're run by the Home Nursing Foundation but the Ministry
provides the expertise Dr Rilly Ray from Health Ministry: We are sending more
doctors from the Ministry of Health for attachments and training courses in
geriatric <unclear> word </unclear> medicine In coun countries like United
Kingdom as for the masses they are going abroad for training as well as they
are being sent for generatological nursing course which is now operating
under the school of nursing program

<$J> 
<ICE-SIN:S2B-016#X112:2:J>
Nurses in the centres do more than provide medical care for
the elderly They also organize outings for the aged to boost their confidence
Talks and various health topics are also included to encourage them to lead a
healthy lifestyle With the setting up of more centres in major housing
estates such as Hougang and Yishun more senior citizens will be able to
receive health care at their doorsteps

movie starring local talent and inspired by a true story That's Medium Rare
It's con-man medium Adrian Lim's story given a new treatment The theme is
superstition and how we can fight it and scenes involving ritualistic
sacrifices torture and murder will be part of the story But its producers say
this will be done artistically Tony Yeow <&>  Derrol): We are doing a film for
the global market We want to show this film in America in Europe and in
Australia and therefore the ingredients must appeal to them and uh the
story-line is such that it does call for certain scenes um sex scenes some
violent scenes So it is part and parcel of the marketing plan

exciting and I think for goodness' sake this is hopefully the start of
something big But people like us Orientals get a chance to play a part
because the part is meant to be Oriental and it's not going to be incidental
that we're going to be the Suzy Wong with the high slate or the Fool/Foo
<unclear> word </unclear> Man Chu/Manchu <unclear> word </unclear> or the
amah that gets bumped off I hope we get a chance to play real characters
