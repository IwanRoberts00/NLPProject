<I>

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-075#1:1:A>
Aye so how

<ICE-SIN:S1A-075#2:1:A>
How did you find the video lecture just now

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-075#3:1:B>
Oh that one

<ICE-SIN:S1A-075#4:1:B>
It's very interesting

<ICE-SIN:S1A-075#5:1:B>
Uh I find that I learn a lot from uh the sharing of the of the
teacher and

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-075#6:1:A>
But what what I mean did did your lecturer sort of uh like ask
you all what do you think about tape video lecture

<ICE-SIN:S1A-075#7:1:A>
I mean was it was it like uh you know like our lecturer she told us
I mean she asked views from the other pupils and they were saying that oh it
was rather boring

<ICE-SIN:S1A-075#8:1:A>
I mean she wasn't motivating the teachers

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-075#9:1:B>
Oh I think he got

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-075#10:1:A>
And motivating the the people who are listening to her and and
uhm which is going against what she was preaching because she was actually
supposed to

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-075#11:1:B>
Motivate instead she ya

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-075#12:1:A>
Motivate the students and failed I mean to talk about uhm
sinking you see

<ICE-SIN:S1A-075#13:1:A>
So that's what the comments were lah

<ICE-SIN:S1A-075#14:1:A>
So what what did your lecturer say

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-075#15:1:B>
In in fact uhm she didn't comment on the video

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-075#16:1:A>
Then she went on straight on

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-075#17:1:B>
She went on to our activities just now

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-075#18:1:A>
There was an activity

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-075#19:1:B>
There there there was

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-075#20:1:A>
No no lecture

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-075#21:1:B>
Uhm we we have the activity lah yah because we have to so much
time anyway only about half an hour

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-075#22:1:A>
You know why because our lecturer was saying that uhm he said
most of the time uh the local Singaporean uh students they are always uh
remember she said in one of her lecture she said they are impress by those
those lect those lecturers who uh who can entertain them

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-075#23:1:B>
Entertain

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-075#24:1:A>
And over and above you know the the content of his lectures so
she says this is this one of the reasons uh why because uh she said you you
can rest assured that this is one of the uh this these these are the kind of
lectures that you can expect if you go overseas uh lectures and they do not
take so much you know not like Singapore lecturers

<ICE-SIN:S1A-075#25:1:A>
They pay more attention to their uh presentation especially with an
overhead project uh O H transparencies

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-075#26:1:B>
That's what I mean

<ICE-SIN:S1A-075#27:1:B>
We you have to listen to the content content to really pick up the
interesting thing

<ICE-SIN:S1A-075#28:1:B>
I mean you can't uh really uhm focus on the visuals to depend on
the videos to stimulate you

<ICE-SIN:S1A-075#29:1:B>
Although that that that played a big part in in motivating you to
listen but I think for us we have to be trained <unclear> word </unclear>
motivated in no matter where how it's presented as long as the content is
good

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-075#30:1:A>
Yah exactly

<ICE-SIN:S1A-075#31:1:A>
I I mean there's that's way I I felt that the person who brought
this issue out was rather childish

<ICE-SIN:S1A-075#32:1:A>
I would say to think to I mean to think that we need to be
entertained in order to have uh lecture properly conducted that sort of thing
because I felt that the content was what matters and it was really uhm uhm
something that you know is she made use of materials that were easily
obtainable daily life and newspapers and all that and I don't think you need
to really entertain

<ICE-SIN:S1A-075#33:1:A>
Of course that will help but I think what what it boils to is uh
yourself lah because we're talking about high-level students here

<ICE-SIN:S1A-075#34:1:A>
We're not talking about uhm lower level students uh I mean

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-075#35:1:B>
We're suppose to be high-level thinkers yah

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-075#36:1:A>
Yah they should think beyond just entertainment value and all
that because I thought that that I was actually rather disappointed that they
stopped the film halfway because I was just you know she was just getting
into the uhm crucial part of it which is uhm you know ideas for activities

<ICE-SIN:S1A-075#37:1:A>
And I think we need to know about uhm what what what are the
different views different ideas they have

<ICE-SIN:S1A-075#38:1:A>
Because I think if we are to just limit ourselves to what we can uh
amongst you know the Asian context and all that then we are not we're being
very closed to new ideas

<ICE-SIN:S1A-075#39:1:A>
We shouldn't think about it that way

<ICE-SIN:S1A-075#40:1:A>
So it's rather strange that that person should bring it up and say
now and then that it's so boring

<ICE-SIN:S1A-075#41:1:A>
But I think a lot of the students were not really paying attention
to the content uh

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-075#42:1:B>
And how does how did uh Agnes Chang react to that

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-075#43:1:A>
Oh yah that's what that's what she said

<ICE-SIN:S1A-075#44:1:A>
She said there are sadly to say a lot of the local students think
that uhm entertainment comes before content you know uh and unfortunately she
says a lot the local lecturers uhm content wise is very strong uh
entertaining wise is not as strong so we have to look beyond that especially
you know if you see yourself as a high-level students

<ICE-SIN:S1A-075#45:1:A>
I would think that uh I mean it is so shallow to say that
entertainment value comes before content

<ICE-SIN:S1A-075#46:1:A>
I mean it would be fine

<ICE-SIN:S1A-075#47:1:A>
I mean it would be a bonus if we get a person who can entertainment
as well as to give us solid content

<ICE-SIN:S1A-075#48:1:A>
Because according to to her she says that uh she has once come I
mean she she says that the very bright students will straight away know

<ICE-SIN:S1A-075#49:1:A>
Uh whether you are just playing time by your entertaining and
withholding all your content or you have no content to provide

<ICE-SIN:S1A-075#50:1:A>
That's why you are doing all the entertaining all the time

<ICE-SIN:S1A-075#51:1:A>
Uhm and compare this lecturer with another lecturer who's really
boring but he's giving you a lot of uh content material in terms of the topic
so she <unclear> word </unclear> anything

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-075#52:1:B>
So the probably the student is not exercising her critical
thinking anymore because if she's looking for that alone and and not on the
content what is there to be what is there to develop in terms of the critical
thinking part

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-075#53:1:A>
Yah because I think perhaps maybe one one one of the thing is
the venue in which they have uhm telecast

<ICE-SIN:S1A-075#54:1:A>
I mean they have uh tape video on because the screen is rather tiny
and and

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-075#55:1:B>
And those uh thing projected on the wall

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-075#56:1:A>
O H P

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-075#57:1:B>
On the screen is not well seen

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-075#58:1:A>
Cannot be seen

<ICE-SIN:S1A-075#59:1:A>
I I do not know whether that is whether I mean but I think one
thing also they should have probably uhm give us a more focussed directed us
to a more focussed what why why they're showing this video to us and at least
give us some leeway <unclear> word </unclear>

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-075#60:1:B>
Things to look out for

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-075#61:1:A>
Yah to look out for exactly because I mean it's this this
video screening was like a lecture instead of a lecture with a live person

<ICE-SIN:S1A-075#62:1:A>
It's lecture over the video

<ICE-SIN:S1A-075#63:1:A>
But uh here we are in this small screen trying very hard to look at
the the notes on the screen uhm so that maybe <unclear> word </unclear>
probably they get a bit discouraged from that

<ICE-SIN:S1A-075#64:1:A>
But I think uh the summary was good the summary she gave yah she
gave one of the I mean one of the lecturers giving uh one of the summary at
the end

<ICE-SIN:S1A-075#65:1:A>
I mean at least it helps us

<ICE-SIN:S1A-075#66:1:A>
Yah this is actually what we were we were looking at but uhm it was
like a bit too late if you missed it

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-075#67:1:B>
But it's quite but I felt the summary is a bit brief in a
sense that I thought she I thought she taught <unclear> word </unclear> more
than what she has summarised

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-075#68:1:A>
Oh of course she did

<ICE-SIN:S1A-075#69:1:A>
I mean like there was one section on uhm what you call
meaning-centred uh motivate meaning-centred programme or approach uhm which
she hardly ever touched which she <unclear> word </unclear> hardly ever
touched on it

<ICE-SIN:S1A-075#70:1:A>
But I think she guess she treat us uh like what high-level adults
and uh probably assumed a lot

<ICE-SIN:S1A-075#71:1:A>
Or she may have thought that what is written on the screen wasn't
uhm that important uhm probably more important is the fact that you know we
listened to uhm what she has the the person in the video has to share

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-075#72:1:B>
That means that uh she expected us to get more get down more
points than what she has summarised

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-075#73:1:A>
Ya I think her summary

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-075#74:1:B>
It's just to confirm what we have summarised

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-075#75:1:A>
Yes more yes that's right

<ICE-SIN:S1A-075#76:1:A>
It's used to confirm and like we have listened yah what we have
written down

<ICE-SIN:S1A-075#77:1:A>
I think her summary was written there and then

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-075#78:1:B>
Yes I think so like I saw her doing something just now

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-075#79:1:A>
Right

<ICE-SIN:S1A-075#80:1:A>
She was she was scribbling on

<ICE-SIN:S1A-075#81:1:A>
Yah so I don't know but so what what what did your lecturer do
after the screening

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-075#82:1:B>
Oh we have a very interesting discussion about left-handers
and right-hander

<ICE-SIN:S1A-075#83:1:B>
Yah and it sort of confirm that I'm really a left-hander

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-075#84:1:A>
Why

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-075#85:1:B>
Because because she was uh stressing on the part that uhm that
the left-hander they they are more creative although I I don't think I'm that
creative but uh some aspect of how I how I exercise my thinking seems to fall
in with what she said

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-075#86:1:A>
And what is that

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-075#87:1:B>
Like for example I sometimes uh I tend to be more stimulated
by visual presentation than verbal one and when come to problem-solving maybe
I depend more on images than uh

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-075#88:1:A>
You mean

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-075#89:1:B>
Written words

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-075#90:1:A>
Okay you mean you mean if you were given a mathematical
problem you will actually uh draw the diagrams and then

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-075#91:1:B>
Of course because a lot of problems cannot depend on images
and pictures to diagrams to to be to solve but I guess that's because of our
training in in schools that's why we don't we don't become that sort of
problem-solver

<ICE-SIN:S1A-075#92:1:B>
But I think uh for me I find that diagrams helps helps a lot if if
I'm to solve a problem

<ICE-SIN:S1A-075#93:1:B>
I find that it it really help me to be focussed on a problem

<ICE-SIN:S1A-075#94:1:B>
We really understand how how to go about solving a problem

<ICE-SIN:S1A-075#95:1:B>
Uh and what's the other interesting point

<ICE-SIN:S1A-075#96:1:B>
Uhm and also when I look at things I think I I adopt I adopt a more
a holistic view than you know uh than analytical view on things

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-075#97:1:A>
Oh what do you mean

<ICE-SIN:S1A-075#98:1:A>
You mean you look at whole things rather than in parts

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-075#99:1:B>
Things on a whole yah than its part

<ICE-SIN:S1A-075#100:1:B>
So I guess I'm more I'm better in synthesising things than
analysing so when come to analysing problem I'm quite poor I think

<ICE-SIN:S1A-075#101:1:B>
But when it come to synthesising a lot of things that I've learnt
I think I better at it

<ICE-SIN:S1A-075#102:1:B>
That's why I I really like uhm Doctor Tan Tai Wei's because he's
very philosophical and people who are philosophical actually look at things
on a whole

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-075#103:1:A>
Whole yah more holistic

<$B> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-075#104:1:B>
Yah so

<$A> 
<ICE-SIN:S1A-075#105:1:A>
Did you oh you didn't read an article

<ICE-SIN:S1A-075#106:1:A>
There there was this uhm actually article that was uh given to us
in mathematical mathematical class and uhm based on what you call why are
students not using the visual uhm uh using visual uh diagrams to help them in
solving in problem-solving

<ICE-SIN:S1A-075#107:1:A>
And uhm basically uh what they are trying to say is that uh you
know because diagrammatically wise it's probably easy

<ICE-SIN:S1A-075#108:1:A>
You can straight away uhm see the solution rather than working it
by you know Algorithms you know or or by certain steps which we were taught
in school

<ICE-SIN:S1A-075#109:1:A>
So the question posted was you know why why are teachers not using
more visual diagrams to help in problem-solving and then basically they came
up with uh several reasons

<ICE-SIN:S1A-075#110:1:A>
The first one of course being that the teachers themselves were
not trained uhm uhm to visually solve the problem and then uh because they
actually did an experiment in the American University where uh some very
simple actually problems that were given to students and they were expected
because they were actually taught uh they were actually the Algorithms of uh
solving this problems </I>
